# Elemental concentrations in representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants and associated soils in terrestrial Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain.

- A dataset documenting multi-element concentrations in representative animals and plants (RAPs) and associated soils from terrestrial Mediterranean ecosystems near Monfragüe National Park, Cáceres, Spain.
- Two primary sampling locations: a dehesa (Mediterranean grassland with dispersed holm oaks) and Bazagona pinewood; sampling sites described as Pond area, Dry riverbed area, Rat sampling area within the dehesa, and Pinewood area.
- GPS-based site recording and map-based context provided; sampling areas include approximately 4,600 ha dehesa with specific subareas (e.g., Pond area ~5,000 m2; Dry riverbed ~600 m2; Rat sampling area ~9,500 m2; Pinewood area ~5,200 m2).

- Sampling framework and species/assemblage
  - Earthworms (Lumbricidae), Bees (Apis mellifera), Frogs (Pelophylax perezi), Rats (Apodemus sylvaticus), Deer (Cervus elaphus), Duck (Anas platyrhynchos), Wild grass (Briza minor), Pine tree (Pinus pinaster), and Soil.
  - Tissues and samples collected per organism: whole organisms or selected tissues (e.g., gut, thyroid, liver, kidney, carcass) for animals; leaves, cones, bark, wood, and branches for pine; aboveground biomass for wild grass; soil samples from 0–10 cm depth.
  - For some wildlife (e.g., deer), tissues collected from individuals culled by hunters; exact capture locations for certain animals not recorded.

- Sampling details and measurements
  - Dates: July 2014 (various RAPs) and November 2014 (bees); weight ranges and mean fresh weights for each organism or tissue, with normalizing statements (e.g., dry/fresh ratios).
  - Sample processing prior to analysis: gut evacuation for earthworms; tissue dissection into specific organs; cryogenic grinding for animal tissues; freeze-drying for most tissues; composite samples created for some tissues (e.g., thyroid/bulked samples for small tissues).
  - Specifics by organism show variability in sampling units and tissue separation (e.g., rats: gut, thyroid region bulk, liver, kidney, carcass; deer: liver, kidney, hind leg meat/bone, thyroid).

- Soil and plant sampling details
  - Soil: 0–10 cm depth, composite of at least six samples per site, sieved, homogenized, oven-dried; results expressed as mg/kg dry weight.
  - Wild grass: predominantly Briza minor; collected ~1 cm above soil, freeze-dried.
  - Pine trees: sampling in pinewood area only; leaves, cones, bark, wood, and branches collected and composite samples formed.

- Analytical methods and QA/QC
  - Multi-element analysis by ICP-MS (with different cell modes: He-cell, STD, H2-cell) and separate iodine analysis using a 1% TMAH matrix.
  - Preparation/digestion methods:
    - Soils: size reduction; two digestion routes in some cases (acid digestion with HF, HNO3, HClO4; and 10% TMAH extraction for certain elements).
    - Plants: microwave-assisted acid digestion (HNO3) and microwave-assisted TMAH extraction; some plants required coarser particle sizes.
    - Animal tissues: acid digestion using HNO3 and H2O2; for small samples, adjusted digestion volumes; TMAH extraction used for tissues in some cases.
  - Validation and QA:
    - Use of Standard Reference Materials: NIST SRM 2711a Montana soil; NIST 1573a Tomato Leaves; NIST 1577c Bovine Liver; blanks and replicates included.
    - Recovery and accuracy: iodine recovery via TMAH and CRMs; plant iodine recovery ~89–91% with 0.85 µg/kg as reference; animal tissue recoveries typically 95–105% against NIST 1577c; soil recoveries for B and S were poor in some acid digestions, likely due to volatile species.
  - Data notes and limitations:
    - Some plant samples (RCN122, RCP300, RCP303, RCP125) partially dissolved; iodine concentrations may be affected.
    - For deer, exact hunting locations not recorded; whole-body content assumptions based on UK data to estimate whole-organism concentrations.
    - In soils, B and S not detected above limits in some samples; no CRs calculated for those elements in those soils.
  - Iodine measured separately due to unique chemistry; back-calibration and matrix considerations noted.

- Data structure and outputs
  - Concentrations for soils, plants, and animal tissues across multiple elements; results standardized to dry weight for soils; tissue concentrations derived from digestions and sub-sample analyses.
  - Dataset designed to underpin transfer parameter assessments and environmental exposure modelling, aligning with ICRP reference animal and plant frameworks.
