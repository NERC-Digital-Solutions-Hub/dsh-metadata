# Elemental concentrations in representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants and associated soils in terrestrial Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain.

## Overview
- Dataset of stable-element concentrations in representative species of ICRP reference animals and plants (RAPs) and associated soils from terrestrial Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain.
- Samples include soils, plants, and multiple animal tissues across two sites in Cáceres (Monfragüe area).

## Study locations and sampling design
- Locations: Dehesa (Mediterranean grassland with holm oaks) and Bazagona pinewood near Monfragüe National Park.
- Dehesa sampling areas: Pond area, Dry riverbed area, Rat sampling area (with soils, RAPs, and tissues collected at each site).
- Pinewood sampling area: Pinewood area (soil, wild grass, and pine tree samples).
- Deer tissue samples collected from hunted animals; exact kill locations not recorded.
- Surface area coverage and sampling distances described for each area.

## Target taxa and samples
- Earthworms (Lumbricidae), Bees (Apis mellifera), Frogs (Pelophylax perezi), Rats (Apodemus sylvaticus), Deer (Cervus elaphus), Duck (Anas platyrhynchos), Wild grass (Briza minor), Pine tree (Pinus pinaster), Soil.
- Tissue and sample details:
  - Earthworms: multiple individuals; gut evacuated; freeze-dried.
  - Bees: individual fresh masses recorded; hive is mobile.
  - Frogs: whole body weighed; tissues dissected and freeze-dried; thyroid area analyzed as a proxy.
  - Rats: whole-body and tissue dissections (gut, thyroid area, liver, kidney, carcass); freeze-dried.
  - Deer: liver, kidney, meat, bone, thyroid analyzed as composites; fresh weights recorded where possible.
  - Duck: whole body weighted; thyroid, liver, kidney, carcass analyzed.
  - Wild grass and pine parts: dried/frozen for analysis.
  - Soil: 0–10 cm depth, composite samples, dried.

## Sampling methods
- Location coordinates recorded with handheld GPS.
- Fresh weights recorded for all animal samples; dry/fresh ratios determined.
- Tissue separation and composite sampling performed where exact origin or weight was not feasible.

## Laboratory methods and extraction procedures
- All RAP samples and soils analyzed by ICP-MS for multiple elements.
- Sample preparation:
  - Soils: size reduction; ground to fine material.
  - Plant material: ground to fine material; some samples larger (≈5 mm).
  - Animal tissues: cryogenic grinding; some bone/muscle sub-sampling for total content.
- Extractions and digestions:
  - Soil acid digestion (HF, HNO3, HClO4) for silicate/oxide dissolution.
  - Soil TMAH extraction for selective solubilization.
  - Microwave-assisted acid digestion for plant material (HNO3) and iodine-specific TMAH extraction for iodine.
  - Microwave-assisted digestion for animal tissues (HNO3, H2O2) with size-adjusted protocols for small samples.
  - TMAH extraction for animal tissues.
- Iodine analysis performed separately using 1% TMAH; calibrated with NaIO3 solutions; Re used as internal standard.
- Quality control:
  - Standard Reference Materials (NIST) included for soil, plant, and animal tissues.
  - Blanks, replicate digestions, and CRM recoveries used to assess accuracy and precision.
  - Recovery ranges noted (e.g., iodine in tomato leaves CRM showed ~89–95% recovery in some methods).

## Instrumentation and data handling
- ICP-MS (Thermo-Fisher iCAP-Q) with collision-cell modes (He-cell, STD, H2-cell) and internal standards (Ge, Rh, Ir).
- External multielement standards and matrix-matched calibrations used.
- Iodine measured with a separate 1% TMAH matrix and NaIO3 standards.
- Data processing with Qtegra software; detection limits defined as 3× standard deviation of blanks.

## Dataset scope and limitations
- Compositional data for 17 soils, 34 plants, and 118 animal tissues.
- Some samples (notably certain plants) were not fully dissolved; iodine concentrations may be affected.
- In soils, B and S recoveries were poor relative to CRMs, possibly due to volatile species formation during digestion.
- Deer thyroid values used when multiple samples were present; whole-organism estimates based on UK reference proportions where direct data were unavailable.
- Some deer sampling details (exact kill locations) were not recorded.
