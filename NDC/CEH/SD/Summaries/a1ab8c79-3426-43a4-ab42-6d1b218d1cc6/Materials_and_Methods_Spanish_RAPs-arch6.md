# Elemental concentrations in representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants and associated soils in terrestrial Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain.

## Study design and sampling

- Location: Cáceres province, west Spain, around Monfragüe National Park; two main sites – a dehesa (Mediterranean grassland with dispersed holm oaks) and Bazagona pinewood (natural, unmanaged).
- Dehesa specifics: Valero dehesa (>4,600 ha; ~1,330 ha within the National Park); traditional rotation of cereals, legumes, fallow, and wildlife areas.
- Sampling areas within the dehesa: Pond area (~5,000 m2), Dry riverbed area (~600 m2), Rat sampling area (~9,500 m2). Pinewood area sampled ~5,200 m2, about 16 km from the pond area.
- Sampling locations and species (RAPs) include: earthworms (Lumbricidae), bees (Apis mellifera), frogs (Pelophylax perezi), rats (Apodemus sylvaticus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), duck (Anas platyrhynchos), wild grass (Briza minor), pine tree (Pinus pinaster) and soil.
- Sampling timing: Earthworms, frogs, and possibly others in July 2014; bees collected in November 2014; deer killed by hunters; overall composition includes animal tissues, plant material, and soils.
- Study aims: multi-taxon, terrestrial ecosystem exposure data to support transfer modeling and provide data for whole-organism concentrations and tissue-specific contents.

## Sample collection and preparation

- Location data: sampling sites recorded with handheld GPS; fresh weights reported for all animal samples.
- Tissue and material processing by taxon:
  - Earthworms: 19 individuals collected; gut evacuated; mean fresh weight ~0.45 g; grouped in 3–4; freeze-dried; dry/fresh ratio ~0.17.
  - Bees: 20 individuals; mean fresh mass ~0.127 g; freeze-dried; dry/fresh ratio ~0.66; hives are mobile.
  - Frogs: 3 adults; body weight ~24.14 g; tissues dissected (gut, thyroid area, liver, kidney, carcass); thyroid treated as a bulk sample; dry/fresh ratios recorded; muscle and bone percentages inferred from UK data.
  - Rats: 12 individuals (three at pond area; nine at rat-sampling area); mean body weight ~18.97 g; tissues dissected (gut, thyroid area, liver, kidney, carcass); thyroid analysed as bulk sample; freeze-dried; meat (~93.3%) and bone (~6.7%) proportions from UK data; bone and muscle percentages (~4.1% and 56.7%) in whole organism inferred from UK data.
  - Deer: red deer tissues from hunted individuals; liver and kidney from 4–8 animals; meat and bone from a hind leg; thyroid collected; whole-organism estimates based on UK body composition; deer roam across dehesa areas; mean plant and soil concentrations used for concentration ratio calculations.
  - Duck: 1 individual; thyroid, liver, kidney, and carcass weighed; whole body fresh weight recorded.
  - Wild grass: Briza minor; collected ~1 cm above soil; freeze-dried; dry/fresh ratio ~0.81.
  - Pine tree: Pinus pinaster; leaves, cones, bark, wood, and branches sampled and compositeed across multiple trees; freeze-dried.
  - Soil: samples 0–10 cm (ICRP standard); at least 6 samples per site combined into a composite; sieved, oven-dried; results reported as mg/kg dry weight.
- Sample preparation details:
  - Plant and soil materials ground to fine powders; animal tissues cryogrind with liquid nitrogen; some samples required manual separation of bone and muscle (notably certain animal tissues).

## Analytical methods and data processing

- Target analyses: multi-element, stable elements in soils, plants, and animal tissues; iodine analyzed separately.
- Extraction and digestion strategies:
  - Soil: acid digestion (HF, HNO3, HClO4) and 10% TMAH extraction; duplicates and SRM checks included.
  - Plant material: microwave-assisted acid digestion (HNO3) and microwave-assisted TMAH extraction; some samples showed incomplete dissolution; iodine recovery checked with CRM.
  - Animal tissues: microwave digestion (HNO3 + H2O2) and TMAH extraction; full dissolution achieved for most samples; some bone residues observed.
- Instrumentation and QA/QC:
  - ICP-MS (iCAP-Q) with three modes: He-cell (collision), STD, and H2-cell; internal standards Ge, Rh, Ir; external calibrations with multi-element standards; internal/external cross-calibration used for accuracy.
  - Iodine measured separately via a 1% TMAH matrix; calibrated with NaIO3 solutions; Re used as internal standard.
  - Detection limits defined as 3× the standard deviation of reagent blanks.
  - Use of certified reference materials for method validation: NIST SRM 2711a (soil), NIST 1573a (Tomato Leaves), NIST 1577c (Bovine Liver); additional blanks and CRMs included to monitor accuracy and precision.
- Data quality notes:
  - Some plant samples partially dissolved in TMAH digestion; iodine recoveries for TMAH extraction of plant tissue were 89–91% in CRM checks, indicating good solubilization when finely ground, but accuracy may be affected for poorly ground samples (e.g., RCN122, RCP300, RCP303, RCP125).
  - Soil measurements showed poor recoveries for B and S due to potential volatile species formation during digestion; plant and animal data for B and S generally reliable relative to CRM data.
  - For several deer and rodent tissues, whole-organism concentrations relied on UK-derived body composition data to scale tissue contents.

## Data interpretation and usage notes

- The dataset provides elemental concentrations across soils, representative plants, and animal tissues for a Mediterranean terrestrial ecosystem in Spain, enabling:
  - Calculation of transfer parameters (soil-to-plant, plant-to-animal, and whole-organism content).
  - Development of site- and taxon-specific data products (e.g., concentration ratios, tissue-specific concentrations, and whole-organism approximations).
  - Cross-taxon comparisons and benchmarking against the ICRP reference animals and plants framework.
- Cautions:
  - Some samples exhibited incomplete dissolution, particularly certain plant tissues in TMAH, which may affect iodine and other element measurements.
  - Whole-organism concentration estimates for deer and some small mammals rely on UK-based body composition data; applicability to Spanish populations should be considered.
  - Soil measurements for B and S may be underestimated due to digestion losses; interpretation of these elements should account for potential under-recovery.
