# Elemental concentrations in representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants and associated soils in terrestrial Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain.

## Overview and objective
- Provides multi-element concentrations in representative species of the ICRP’s reference animals and plants (RAPs) and associated soils from Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain.
- Aims to support environmental health monitoring, transfer parameter estimation, and evaluation of policy decisions.

## Sampling sites and design
- Location: Cáceres province, west Spain, near Monfragüe National Park.
- Two main habitats:
  - Dehesa: traditional Mediterranean grassland with dispersed holm oaks; sampling at Pond area, Dry riverbed area, and Rat sampling area.
  - Bazagona pinewood: natural pinewood with no pine present in the dehesa; sampling at Pinewood area.
- Sampling structure:
  - Pond area (dehesa): Earthworms, Bees, Frogs, Rat, Wild Grass RAPs, and soil.
  - Dry riverbed area (dehesa): Soil; distal from Pond area.
  - Rat sampling area (dehesa): Bee, Rat, Wild Grass RAPs, soil.
  - Pinewood area: Soil, Wild Grass, Pine tree.
- Deer tissues sampled from culled animals; exact kill location not recorded.
- Sampling dates around 2014 (e.g., July 2014 for some species; November 2014 for bees).

## Target organisms and tissues
- Earthworms (Lumbricidae)
- Bees (Apis mellifera)
- Frogs (Pelophylax perezi)
- Rats (Apodemus sylvaticus)
- Red deer (Cervus elaphus)
- Duck (Anas platyrhynchos)
- Wild grass (Briza minor)
- Pine tree (Pinus pinaster)
- Soils (0–10 cm)

## Sample collection and preparation
- Locations recorded by GPS; fresh weights reported for all animal samples.
- Tissue handling:
  - Earthworms and insects: freeze-dried; dry/fresh ratios established.
  - Vertebrates: tissues separated (e.g., thyroid, liver, kidney, carcass); some samples treated as bulked tissues when separation was impractical.
  - Deer: liver, kidney, thyroid, meat/bone, and composite samples; whole-organism estimates based on reference values due to lack of exact locality data.
- Plant and soil samples dried, ground, or homogenized as required; composite soil samples created from multiple subsamples.

## Analytical methods and extraction procedures
- Elemental analysis: ICP-MS (iCAP-Q) with multiple cell modes (He-cell, STD, H2-cell); iodine measured separately using a 1% TMAH matrix.
- Internal standards: Ge, Rh, Ir; external calibrations covering a broad suite of elements; QA via CRM materials.
- Sample preparation by extraction/digestion:
  - Soils: acid digestion (HF, HNO3, HClO4) and TMAH extraction; soil treated to ~1% HNO3 final matrix for ICP-MS.
  - Plants: microwave-assisted acid digestion (HNO3) and microwave-assisted TMAH extraction; iodine recovery tested with CRM.
  - Animal tissues: microwave-assisted acid digestion (HNO3/H2O2) and TMAH extraction; dilution to typical HNO3 concentration; QA with CRM.
- Quality control:
  - Use of NIST CRMs (e.g., SRMs 2711a, 1573a, 1577c) to verify digestion and analysis accuracy.
  - Recovery checks: iodine 89–95% in certain plant matrices; B and S recoveries in soils may be affected by volatilization during digestion.
  - Documentation of partial dissolution issues (notably some plant samples) and notes on potential inaccuracies for a few samples (RCN122, RCP300, RCP303, RCP125).

## Data scope and limitations
- Included dataset comprises concentrations in 17 soils, 34 plant samples, and 118 animal tissue samples.
- Certain plant samples were not fully dissolved, affecting iodine measurements for a subset; some deer/thyroid analyses included as bulks due to practical constraints.
- Acknowledges variability in tissue composition (meat/bone proportions) and uses UK reference values to estimate whole-organism concentrations where necessary.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates end-to-end workflow for generating monitoring-ready data:
  - Site selection, representative species, and composite sampling to capture ecosystem transfer pathways.
  - Rigorous sample preparation with tissue-specific handling and preparation protocols.
  - Multi-method chemical analysis with robust QA and traceability to certified reference materials.
  - Transparent reporting of potential data limitations and dissolution issues.
- Provides a data-rich basis for deriving transfer parameters and informing policy decisions regarding environmental health monitoring and data governance.

## Data governance, openness, and dissemination (implications for frameworks)
- Uses standardized QA procedures and references to established ICRP/IAEA frameworks, aiding comparability.
- Documentation includes detailed methodological descriptions, enabling reproducibility and critical evaluation.
- Notes limitations and data quality issues, highlighting the importance of metadata completeness, dissolution completeness, and documenting sample-specific caveats in governance processes.
- Acknowledges project-level support and collaborations, illustrating governance and funding pathways for monitoring programs.
