# Supporting documentation for Sample_list.csv

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides metadata for the Sample_list.csv dataset to enable interpretation, reuse, and linkage of samples.
  - Focuses on radiological exposure context via ICRP Reference Animals and Plants (RAP) classifications.
  - Documents what each field represents, its units (where applicable), and any notes.

- Data fields and definitions
  - Sample_Code
    - Description: Unique sample identifier
    - Units: n/a
    - Notes: 
  - RAP
    - Description: RAP classification to which the sampled species can be attributed (ICRP)
    - Units: n/a
    - Notes: 
  - Sample_Description
    - Description: Part of the organism analyzed (e.g., whole organism divided and analyzed separately)
    - Units: n/a
    - Notes: 
  - Collection_Date
    - Description: Date of sample collection
    - Units: dd-mmm-yy
    - Notes: 
  - Dry/Fresh_Ratio
    - Description: Dry to fresh weight ratio
    - Units: unitless
    - Notes: 
  - Coordinates_of_the_Sample
    - Description: Grid reference of sampling location
    - Units: decimal degrees and minutes
    - Notes: 
  - Sample_Association
    - Description: Unique sample identifier of soil sampled at the same site
    - Units: n/a
    - Notes: 
  - Notes
    - Description: Additional comments (where applicable)
    - Units: n/a
    - Notes: 

- Data quality and usage notes
  - Standardization
    - Date format (dd-mmm-yy) and coordinate notation (decimal degrees and minutes) are defined for consistency.
  - Linkability
    - RAP enables linking to organism type; Sample_Association allows grouping with soil samples from the same site.
  - Completeness and notes
    - Several Notes fields may be blank; metadata completeness is essential for interpretability.
  - Readiness for analysis
    - Structure supports filtering by RAP, collection date, location, and sample description; coordinates enable spatial analyses.
  - Considerations for analysis
    - Ensure coordinate reference system consistency; compare dry/fresh ratios when analyzing concentration data; account for potential missing metadata.

- Implications for analysts
  - Facilitates cross-dataset integration across sites and times via Sample_Code, RAP, and Sample_Association.
  - Supports spatial and temporal analyses through Coordinates_of_the_Sample and Collection_Date.
  - Enables provenance and reuse through well-defined field explanations and metadata.
