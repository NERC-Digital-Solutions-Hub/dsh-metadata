# Elemental concentrations in representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants and associated soils in terrestrial Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain.

## Overview
- Dataset documenting stable element concentrations in representative species of ICRP reference animals and plants (RAPs) and associated soils from Mediterranean terrestrial ecosystems in Spain.
- Study location: Cáceres province, west Spain, around Monfragüe National Park, including a dehesa (mixed grassland with Holm oak) and a Bazagona pinewood.
- Aimed to support assessment of data for environmental transfer and risk analyses by providing multi-taxa, tissue- and soil-based concentration data.

## Study area and sampling sites
- Dehesa site: Valero dehesa, >4,600 ha total; adjacent to Monfragüe National Park; management based on annual quarter rotations (cereals, legumes, fallow, wildlife).
- Pinewood site: Bazagona pinewood (natural, no management).
- Sampling areas within dehesa:
  - Pond area (~5,000 m²): Earthworms, Bees, Frogs, Rat, Wild Grass RAPs, and soil.
  - Dry riverbed area (~600 m²): Soil and proximate areas ~200 m from Pond area.
  - Rat sampling area (~9,500 m²): Bee, Rat, Wild Grass RAPs, soil; located ~4 km from Pond area.
- Pinewood area: Soil, Wild Grass, and Pine tree (Pinus pinaster) samples (~5,200 m² area; ~16 km from Pond area).
- Animal tissues from red deer were collected from hunters; exact kill locations sometimes unknown.

## Species, tissues, and sampling details
- Earthworms (Lumbricidae): 19 individuals from pond area; gut evacuation prior to processing; freeze-dried; dry/fresh ratio recorded.
- Bees (Apis mellifera): 20 individuals from rat sampling area; fresh weights recorded; freeze-dried; hive may be mobile.
- Frogs (Pelophylax perezi): 3 adults; whole-body weight and tissue dissection (muscle, thyroid area, liver, kidney, carcass); tissues freeze-dried; some tissue ratios referenced from UK data.
- Rats (Apodemus sylvaticus): 12 individuals total (3 at pond area; 9 at rat sampling area); tissues dissected (gut, thyroid area, liver, kidney, carcass); whole-organism estimates based on UK tissue composition data; samples freeze-dried.
- Deer (Cervus elaphus): Liver, kidney from multiple individuals; meat and bone from hind leg; thyroid collected; whole-organism concentrations estimated using UK body composition data; precise kill locations not recorded.
- Duck (Anas platyrhynchos): 1 individual; thyroid, liver, kidney, carcass dissected; whole body fresh weight recorded; gut removed.
- Wild grass (Briza minor): Collected via sickle; freeze-dried; dry/fresh ratio recorded.
- Pine tree (Pinus pinaster): Pine leaves, cones, bark, wood, and branches from several trees to form a composite sample; freeze-dried.
- Soil samples: 0–10 cm depth; composite from multiple 0–10 cm subsamples per site; sieved and oven-dried; expressed as mg/kg dry weight.

## Sample collection and preparation (key points)
- Location coordinates recorded with handheld GPS.
- Fresh and dry tissue weights recorded; samples freeze-dried prior to analysis.
- Specific dissection and tissue separation performed to enable whole-organism concentration estimation where possible.
- Composite samples created to represent site-level conditions (soils, grasses, etc.).

## Analytical methods and QA/QC
- Elemental analysis: Multi-element ICP-MS (Thermo-Fisher iCAP-Q) with three operational modes:
  - He-cell (collision-cell with kinetic energy discrimination)
  - STD (standard; collision cell evacuated)
  - H2-cell (hydrogen mode)
- Internal standards: Ge, Rh, Ir added in 2% HNO3 matrix.
- External calibration standards: broad suite of elements (Au, Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Ca, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, S, Se, Sr, Tl, U, V, Zn); complementary Ca, Mg, Na, K standards; phosphorus, boron, sulfur calibration with in-house standards.
- Iodine analysis: performed separately using 1% TMAH matrix; calibrated with NaIO3 solutions; Re internal standard.
- Sample preparation specifics:
  - Soils: HF/HNO3/HClO4 digestion; ~0.200 g soil per digestion; SRM 2711a for accuracy checks.
  - Soils: TMAH extraction (10% TMAH, 90°C 24 h) for partial extraction; samples diluted for analysis.
  - Plants: Microwave-assisted acid digestion (HNO3) with CRM NIST 1573a Tomato Leaves; full dissolution achieved for most elements; recoveries 90–95% for many certified elements; samples diluted before ICP-MS analysis.
  - Plants: Microwave-assisted TMAH extraction for iodine and other elements; acknowledge incomplete dissolution for some plant samples; iodine recovery ~89–91% in tested CRM.
  - Animal tissues: Microwave-assisted digestion with HNO3/H2O2; full dissolution achieved; CRM NIST 1577c Bovine Liver used for QA; dilution required for some samples.
  - TMAH extraction for animal tissues to enable broader element solubilization; some undissolved bone fragments observed in a few samples.
- Detection limits: 3× standard deviation of blanks for each extraction and sample type.
- Notes on data quality:
  - Some soil measurements for B and S had poor recoveries relative to CRM; potential volatility during digestion.
  - Some plant samples partially dissolved in TMAH extraction; iodine concentrations in those samples may be inaccurate.

## Data scope and limitations
- Analyzed matrices: 17 soils, 34 plants, 118 animal tissue samples, with associated soil and plant materials.
- Concentrations expressed on a dry weight basis (mg/kg d.w.) for soils; plant and animal tissues prepared as described to estimate whole-organism concentrations where possible.
- Limitations affecting data interpretation:
  - Partial dissolution in some plant tissues during TMAH extraction, affecting iodine accuracy in certain samples.
  - Deer sampling constrained by hunter-supplied tissues; exact locations and weights not available for some individuals; whole-organism estimates rely on external body composition data.
  - Potential variability due to the mobile nature of some biological materials (e.g., beehives) and site-specific management practices.

## Data management and provenance
- GPS-referenced sampling locations; unique sample identifiers (RCN/RCP codes) used for tissue analyses.
- Detailed sample preparation protocols (weight ranges, drying, grinding, tissue separation) documented to support reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
- Use of SRMs and blanks to ensure accuracy and traceability of element measurements.
