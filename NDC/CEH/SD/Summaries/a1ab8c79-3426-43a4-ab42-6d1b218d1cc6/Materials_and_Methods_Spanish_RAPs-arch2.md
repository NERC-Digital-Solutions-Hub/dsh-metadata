# Elemental concentrations in representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants and associated soils in terrestrial Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain.

## Summary

- Purpose: Compile multi-element concentrations in soils, plants, and representative animals and plants (RAPs) from Mediterranean ecosystems in western Spain to support environmental monitoring and policy assessment.
- Scope: 34 plant samples, 118 animal tissue samples, and 17 soil samples collected across two sites near Monfragüe National Park (Cáceres): a dehesa and Bazagona pinewood.
- Data design: Standardised sampling of RAPs across distinct microhabitats (pond area, dry riverbed, rat sampling area) within the dehesa and a pinewood area, plus composite soil samples (0–10 cm).
- Analytical approach: 17 soils, 34 plants, and 118 animal tissues analyzed for multi-element concentrations using ICP-MS; iodine analyzed separately with a 1% TMAH matrix. Quality control includes certified reference materials (CRMs) and blanks.
- Outputs and format: Detailed descriptions of sampling locations, species, tissue types, sample handling, digestion/extraction methods, and analytical procedures designed to produce comparable, transferable data for environmental health assessment.
- Data governance: Methods and QA are aligned with standard environmental monitoring practices; dataset intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for accessibility and reuse.

## Sampling sites and design

- Locations
  - Dehesa near Monfragüe National Park (Valero dehesa, 4,600+ ha; private with 1,330 ha inside the park)
  - Bazagona pinewood (natural stand with no management)
- Dehesa sampling areas
  - Pond area (~5,000 m2)
  - Dry riverbed area (~600 m2)
  - Rat sampling area (~9,500 m2)
  - Deer tissues collected from animals culled by hunters; exact kill locations not recorded
- Pinewood sampling area
  - Pinewood area (~5,200 m2), ~16 km from the pond area
  - Soil, wild grass, and Pinus pinaster samples collected
- Composite soils
  - Soil samples (0–10 cm) at each site; at least 6 sub-samples per area combined to form a composite

## Sample collection and target organisms

- Earthworms (Lumbricidae)
  - 19 individuals collected in the pond area (July 2014)
- Bees (Apis mellifera)
  - 20 individuals from a hive in the rat sampling area (Nov 2014)
- Frogs (Pelophylax perezi)
  - 3 adults from the pond area (July 2014)
  - Tissues: gut, thyroid region, liver, kidney, carcass
  - Muscle and bone proportions inferred from UK references due to small size
- Rats (Apodemus sylvaticus)
  - 12 individuals: 3 at the pond area; 9 at the rat sampling area
  - Tissues: gut, thyroid region, liver, kidney, carcass
  - Muscle/bone proportions inferred from UK references
- Deer (Cervus elaphus)
  - Liver, kidney from several individuals; hind leg for meat and bone; thyroid glands collected
  - Whole-organism estimate based on UK body composition data
- Duck (Anas platyrhynchos)
  - 1 individual; tissues: thyroid, liver, kidney, carcass
- Wild grass
  - Briza minor; collected in dehesa and pinewood areas
- Pine tree (Pinus pinaster)
  - Leaves, cones, bark, wood, and branches combined from several trees
- Soils
  - 0–10 cm depth; at least 6 sub-samples per area combined to composite

## Sample preparation and analyses

- General approach
  - All RAP samples and soils analyzed for stable elements via ICP-MS
  - Internal standards: Ge, Rh, Ir
  - External multi-element standards used; iodine quantified separately
  - Three ICP-MS modes employed (He-cell, STD, H2-cell) to manage interferences
- Soils
  - Size-reduced; 0.200 g ±0.100 g digested with HF, HNO3, HClO4
  - Duplicate/triplicate SRMs (NIST SRM 2711a) used for accuracy
  - Samples diluted to ~1% HNO3 for analysis
- Soil extraction (for selected analyses)
  - 1.000 g ±0.100 g soil extracted with 10% tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) at 90°C for 24 h
  - Centrifuged; aliquots diluted for analysis
- Plant material
  - Plant tissues ground to a fine powder
  - Microwave-assisted acid digestion (HNO3) for most samples
  - Duplicate digestions with CRM verification (NIST 1573a Tomato Leaves); 2% HNO3 final matrix
  - TMAH extraction for iodine; recovery assessed with CRM
  - Note: some samples (e.g., RCN122, RCP300, RCP303, RCP125) were partially dissolved; iodine concentrations may be affected
- Animal tissues
  - Finely ground material; three digestion approaches:
    - Microwave-assisted acid digestion with HNO3 + H2O2
    - TMAH extraction for certain tissues
  - For small samples (<0.08 g), adjusted digestion volumes
  - CRM verification with NIST 1577c bovine liver
- Iodine analysis
  - Performed separately using 1% TMAH matrix; calibration with NaIO3 solutions; Re internal standard
  - Recovery context: iodine recovery from NIST tomato leaf CRM ~89–95% (depends on dissolution completeness)
- Data quality and limitations
  - Use of certified reference materials to validate digestion and analysis
  - In soils, B and S recoveries were poor relative to CRMs likely due to volatile species during acid digestion
  - Plant and animal tissues generally show good recoveries with CRMs
  - Some plant samples not fully dissolved may affect iodine accuracy

## Data quality, provenance, and reuse

- Provenance and QA
  - Detailed sample-level data on sampling site, tissue type, and weight
  - QA through CRMs (NIST) and blanks; replicate digestions
  - Internal standards and multiple ICP-MS modes to mitigate interferences
- Limitations
  - Partial dissolution in a subset of plant samples; iodine results may be biased for these
  - Soil B and S recoveries compromised in some digestions
- Relevance for monitoring
  - Standardised collection and processing enable comparability over time and with other ICRP-based monitoring datasets
  - Data designed to support transfer parameter assessment and environmental health evaluation within terrestrial ecosystems
