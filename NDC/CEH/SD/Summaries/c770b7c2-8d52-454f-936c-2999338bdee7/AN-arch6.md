# AN Protocol ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY - NITROGEN DIOXIDE Version 1.1 (previously AC Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

## Aim and Context
- Detect and define changes in periodic mean atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
- NO2 is the key urban NOx pollutant with health and ecosystem impacts; major urban sources include vehicle emissions, power generation, heating, and industry.
- NO2 measurement uses passive diffusion tubes; low capital cost and no on-site power; requires replication due to tube variability; extension to other gases is under review.

## Measurement Method
- Diffusion tubes consist of stainless steel mesh discs coated with NO2 absorbent, prepared and housed in plastic tubes with coloured/clear caps.
- Three experimental tubes (E1–E3) and three blank tubes (B1–B3) deployed per site.
- Tubes mounted in clips at about 1.5 m height (can be on a post or within a meteorological enclosure) and deployed for two weeks.
- Tubes collected after two weeks; blanks are not exposed on-site but transported back with samples.

## Equipment and Preparation
- Tubes and caps; 1 cm diameter stainless steel mesh discs; disassembled and reassembled with absorbent.
- Cleaning and handling: acid wash, Decon 90, ultrasonic cleaning; gloves required during analysis.
- Absorbent preparation: two dry discs per cap with a small volume of triethanolamine solution; strict handling to avoid contamination.
- Reagents and standards for analysis include sulphanilamide, N-1-naphthylethylene-diamine dihydrochloride (NEDA), reagents X and Y, and calibrated NO2 standards.

## Sampling and Labelling
- Standard field procedures and labeling: ECN Measurement Code (AN), ECN Site ID, Location Code, individual tube code (E1–E3 or B1–B3), and Sampling Date.
- Unique reference required for transfer to the ECN database; tubes are labeled for traceability.
- A field recording form is provided, with example in Appendix II.

## Analytical Procedure
- Absorbent is analyzed to determine total NO2 absorbed during the sampling period, used to calculate mean NO2 concentration over that period.
- Colorimetric analysis using reagents Y and X after exposure; absorbance read at 542 nm; calibration against standards (NO2).
- Fresh preparation of reagents daily; operators must wear gloves during analysis.

## Data and Recording Conventions
- Core measurement: atmospheric chemistry - nitrogen dioxide (AN Protocol) with fortnightly recording for six tubes (three experimental, three blanks).
- Required data fields (four key identifiers): 
  - Site Identification Code (unique ECN site)
  - Core Measurement Code (unique for each core measurement)
  - Location Code (replicate location within site)
  - Sampling Date/Time (including time precision)
- Additional fields: Setting out date/time, Sampling date/time, Tube code, Weight NO2 (µg), with time recorded in GMT.
- Data are intended for transfer to the ECN database; dataset formats are specified in accompanying Data Transfer documentation; access via ECNCCU extranet.
- Standard field recording forms and Appendix II provide example templates.

## Data Product and Quality Considerations
- Replication with blanks supports data quality and reliability; data can be used to derive mean NO2 concentrations for given periods and sites.
- Quality assurance framework referenced (UNEP/WHO quality assurance in urban air quality monitoring) and cross-referenced standards and calibrations.
