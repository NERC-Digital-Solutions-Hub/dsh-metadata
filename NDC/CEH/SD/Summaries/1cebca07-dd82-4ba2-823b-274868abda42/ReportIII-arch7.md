# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Location: Sourhope field experiment at Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders, UK.
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; baseline site data described in November 1998 Baseline Data Survey.
- Purpose: provide a general context across years to aid collaboration between research groups; present data in a way that enables linking with other datasets and year-to-year comparisons.
- Data collected and dates summarized (Table 1); site management affected in 2001 by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change of site officer.
- Measurements cover weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition among others; aims to reveal links between treatments, soil properties, and vegetation.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather: rainfall near long-term annual average (1999: 845 mm; 2000: 1209 mm; 2001: 839 mm); radiation levels similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than in prior years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear hierarchical biomass response across treatments; peak biomass typically in July/Aug.
- 2001 biomass substantially higher than previous years, likely due to a change in personnel and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Biomass normalized to the Control 1 (C1) to track treatment effects; analysis shows:
  - Significant differences between improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) vs unimproved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.
- Nitrogen and lime (N and/or L) most effective at boosting productivity; nitrogen plus lime yields strongest biomass.
  
### 2.3 Soil pH
- Upper 5 cm soil pH: liming raised pH to 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raised soil pH to a lesser extent.
- Control plots remained largely unchanged from baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis replicated July 2000 protocol; surveyors’ results were not statistically different.
- 2001 total hits were 58% higher than in 2000, suggesting denser sward due to earlier grazing removal (1998).
- Species composition by treatment:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; remained most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. increased across all treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen (Festuca ovina) and Nitrogen + Lime (Festuca rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots favored Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis; unimproved plots favored Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta.
- Diversity:
  - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential decline in diversity with improved fertility.
- Multivariate analysis (PCA) shows:
  - Clear separation of fertilised and/or limed plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Unimproved plots more uniform with species like Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Improved plots contribute more extreme PCA positions, with stronger association of Festuca rubra and related species.
- Biomass and species: higher above-ground biomass correlates with higher relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; opposite trend for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis as biomass increases.
- Litter presence increased in nitrogen and/or lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (on the upslope, right-hand side) tend to host more acidic plots.
- Although this may be exaggerated by the higher proportion of Controls or Biocide plots in those columns, there is evidence of underlying heterogeneity linked to column location and slope.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass distribution shows outlying plots with the lowest biomass scattered across the site; highest biomass generally in centrally located plots (e.g., Nitrogen + Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant biomass differences among blocks (ANOVA).

## Data and Methods Highlights (relevant for GIS integration)
- Treatments and layout: 5 blocks with 5 treatments (Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime) plus Biocide; spatial arrangement includes multiple columns with distinct pH and biomass patterns.
- Data types collected per plot/year:
  - Biomass: above-ground productivity across five summer cuts (1999–2001); annual totals and mid-summer indices available.
  - Soil: surface pH (0–5 cm; baseline 1998, Oct 2001), moisture, temperature, and rainfall from Automatic Weather Station.
  - Vegetation: Point Quadrat surveys (100 cells per cell; 25 pins per cell) to record species hits; species list codes provided.
  - Datasets include yearly comparisons (1999–2001) with normalisation against C1 for cross-year assessment.
- data notes: 2001 sampling affected by FMD restrictions; one site officer change; adjustments to sampling methods (e.g., switch to mechanical cutting) noted.
- Spatial analysis cues:
  - Spatial heterogeneity across columns and central vs edge plots.
  - Biomass vs pH relationships can be mapped per plot and across years.
  - PCA results demonstrate differential species associations by treatment, enabling spatially informed habitat characterization.
