# SOIL ANALYSIS OF RIGG FOOT, SOURHOPE : BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES

## Introduction / Context
- Part of Sourhope field data (Block 4) detailing soil analyses from auger samples to support long-term environmental monitoring and site comparisons.
- Data accompany vegetational surveys and broader soil profile work across blocks, maintained under MLURI/ECN protocols for quality assurance and accessibility.

## Block 4 Auger Soil Metrics (samples 4A–4F)
- Weight (mg): 4A–4F range from 5.674 to 6.012 mg.
- %N: 0.51–0.58% across samples.
- %C: 6.80–8.02% across samples.
- C:N Ratio: 12.62–14.26.
- Ca (meq/100 g): 1.01–2.96.
- Na (meq/100 g): 0.12–0.15.
- K (meq/100 g): 0.58–0.81.
- Mg (meq/100 g): 0.58–1.59.
- %Moisture loss: 4.29–5.15%.
- %Loss on Ignition (LOI): 14.60–17.96%.
- pH (H2O): 4.45–4.82.
- pH (CaCl2): 3.64–4.05.
- Notable patterns:
  - Sample 4B shows the highest LOI (17.96%) and relatively high Ca (2.96) with pH H2O 4.53.
  - Sample 4C has lower Ca (1.11) and lower C (7.20%), with relatively lower pH values.
  - Overall, soils remain acidic (pH ~4.5–4.8) with moderate organic content and similar C:N ratios, indicating consistent upland soil conditions across these plots.

## ECOTRON PLOT
- Wt: 6.089 mg.
- %N: 0.59; %C: 8.22; C:N Ratio: 13.83.
- Ca: 2.76; Na: 0.15; K: 0.62; Mg: 1.7.
- %Moisture loss: 4.79%; %LOI: 17.42%.
- pH (H2O): 4.79; pH (CaCl2): 3.82.
- Indicates slightly higher carbon and nutrient content relative to some auger samples, with similar acidity and moisture characteristics.

## Vegetation Survey (Block 4)
- Vegetation data collected for plots 4A–4F, detailing species occurrences across subplots.
- Data indicate multi-species ground cover with varying totals per plot, consistent with upland grassland community composition and edge/interior plot variation.

## Data quality, storage, and accessibility
- Data collected and stored under established MLURI/ECN procedures, with standardized sampling and analysis protocols.
- Samples and results are organized by MLURI barcodes and block/plot identifiers, enabling cross-site and temporal comparisons.

## Implications for environmental monitoring and policy
- The Block 4 auger data contribute to a robust baseline of soil chemical and physical properties in upland soils.
- When integrated with vegetation data and additional blocks, supports assessments of nutrient dynamics, soil health, and responses to management practices within environmental monitoring programs.

## End note
- The Block 4 auger dataset provides a detailed, standardized snapshot of soil properties (nutrients, moisture, organic content, pH) at a consistent depth range, alongside vegetation surveys and ECOTRON comparisons, reinforcing Sourhope’s long-term environmental health assessment framework.
