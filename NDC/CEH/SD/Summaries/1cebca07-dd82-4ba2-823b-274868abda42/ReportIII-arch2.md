REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and purpose
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope to provide context for allied studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.
  - Monitoring included weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, using standardized methods to enable cross-year and cross-treatment comparisons.
  - 2001 site management affected by Foot and Mouth restrictions and a change of site officer, with protocol adjustments while maintaining core management activities.

- 2. Results

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 headline weather was generally unremarkable; total rainfall near long-term average (1999: 845 mm, 2000: 1209 mm, 2001: 839 mm).
    - Radiation similar across years; average temperatures slightly lower in 2001; soil moisture content modestly higher than previous years.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass production across the sampling period; peak biomass typically in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass was substantially higher than in previous years, likely due to a shift from manual to mechanical cutting and a change in site personnel.
    - When normalised to the C1 (control) treatment, nitrogen and lime treatments showed the strongest positive impact on productivity.
    - Statistical outcomes: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Liming raised surface soil pH (top 5 cm): about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen-plus-lime plots by October 2001.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent; control plots remained largely unchanged since baseline (1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Analysis followed the 2000 protocol; no significant difference between surveyors; 2001 saw 58% more hits than 2000, suggesting greater sward density (possibly due to grazing removal in 1998).
    - Treatment differences in the most abundant species:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001.
      - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide plots (F. ovina) and N&L plots (F. rubra).
      - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were prominent in fertilised plots, especially N+L.
      - Species typical of less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) were more common in unimproved plots (Control, Biocide).
    - Diversity: unimproved plots showed 24 species; nitrogen+lime plots showed 18 species, suggesting a potential decline in diversity with higher fertility.
    - Multivariate analysis (PCA) showed clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from control and biocide plots; improved plots often represented the more extreme PCA positions.
    - Biomass vs. species composition: higher biomass correlated with higher frequencies of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; opposite trend observed for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) and other bryophytes.
    - Litter increases were more pronounced in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with increased soil fertility.

- 3. Site heterogeneity

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site; columns E and F showed more acidic conditions, particularly among N and/or Lime plots in these columns.
    - While influenced by treatment composition, there is an underlying spatial pattern contributing to pH and plant community differences.

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass values showed spatial outliers; central plots tended to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen+Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D).
    - A strong positive correlation existed between surface soil pH and biomass, though there were no significant differences in biomass between blocks.

- Data collection and analysis notes
  - Main measurements included: automatic weather data, above-ground biomass from regular cuts, soil pH from 0–5 cm, and a July 2001 Point Quadrat botanical survey (100 cells per cell, large PIN technique).
  - Analyses included split-plot ANOVA for biomass, PCA for plant community composition, and correlation of species abundance with biomass.
  - Data management consistent with ongoing monitoring protocols, with weather data transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
