# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

- Four-year field study at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) monitoring above-ground biomass, plant species composition, and diversity in response to five treatment regimes across a replicated block design.
- Main management factors examined: mowing regime, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and insecticide application; a trampling/experimental manipulation also discussed in discussion.
- Central finding themes: changes in productivity (biomass), shifts in species composition, and alterations in functional plant groups (CSR framework) driven by treatments and management history.

## Experimental design and data scope

- Location and layout: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots with treatment allocations; 0.5 m2 cells used for data collection.
- Treatments (plot-level): 
  - Control 1 (no treatment)
  - Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen
  - Lime
  - Nitrogen & Lime
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4, soil-applied)
- Site-wide management: annual mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept); insecticide applied after mowing; spring fertilizer applications; lime and/or nitrogen applied as specified per treatment.
- Data collected (since 1998–1999): 
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station
  - Above-ground biomass: regular 0.5 m2 clippings, dried and weighed
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998; annual/biannual point analyses (0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid), bryophyte sequencing in 2002
  - Soil chemistry and moisture: soil pH (5 cm depth, water), soil moisture via theta probe (2002)
  - Additional vegetation surveys and small-scale biomass sampling (2000–2002)
- Scale and outputs: 11621 soil samples collected to date; biomass data aggregated by plot, year, and treatment; beta/diversity metrics (Shannon index) computed from point analyses; multivariate analyses (PCA) used to examine species-group patterns.

## Key data analyses used

- Split-plot ANOVA (treatment, year, and interactions) on above-ground biomass
- Yearly and cumulative biomass comparisons across treatments
- Correlation and regression analyses linking soil pH, moisture, and biomass
- Point-analysis data analyzed for frequency of hits by species; PCA with treatment-based ranking to separate improved vs unimproved plots
- Assessment of functional groups (stress-tolerators S, competitive-stress-ruderals CSR, and SR/CSR) and their changes over time
- Diversity metrics (Shannon index) tracked across years (1998–2002)

## Main results by topic

- Mowing effect
  - Consistent expansion of stress-tolerant species across most plots, with Festuca rubra particularly favored in fertilised plots.
  - Decline in Agrostis spp. (capillaris and vinealis) by >40% since 2000 across treatments, likely due to mowing regime (homogeneous cuts) and reduced disturbance from grazing.
  - Bryophyte expansion (mosses) linked to mowing height ~6 cm and absence of grazing; moss dominance more evident in unimproved plots.

- Fertilisation effect
  - Long-term productivity boost in fertilised plots, especially where nitrogen and lime are applied together; growth in N&L plots is the strongest but shows signs of possible saturation or moisture limitation (soil pH near 7.0, drier conditions).
  - Lime alone raises soil pH substantially; higher pH is generally associated with increased productivity, though relationships are treatment-specific (positive across all plots when viewed collectively; variable within N or L alone vs N&L).
  - Possible chlorosis and moisture stress observed in highly lime-amended plots during dry periods.

- Insecticide effect
  - Insecticide-treated plots show higher diversity in some years, though causality with diversity is cautious due to limited direct herbivore control data.
  - Hypothesized that reduced herbivory allowed more palatable species to persist, potentially increasing diversity in certain contexts; overall, diversity responses are complex and partly contingent on soil fertility.

- Trampling effect
  - First-year data from C2 plots (associated with labelled 13CO2 pulses) indicate reduced productivity, likely due to trampling during intensive experimental activity.

## Plant community structure and functional groups

- Dominant species dynamics
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline substantially; Festuca ovina and Festuca rubra increase in more fertile, limed/nitrogen-treated plots.
  - Bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increase across the site, contributing to higher bryophyte hits, especially in unimproved plots.

- CSR-based functional shifts
  - Fertilised plots: shift toward competitive (C) and stress-ruderal (SR/CSR) taxa as nutrients rise and disturbance changes.
  - Unfertilised plots: stress-tolerant (S) taxa gain relative prominence due to lower fertility and altered disturbance regime.
  - Across years, clear treatment differences emerge in the proportion of S, CSR, and SR/CSR groups, with nitrogen and lime promoting more competitive members and unimproved plots favouring stress tolerators.

- Diversity and species composition
  - Shannon diversity indices show treatment-by-year differences, with increases in several treatments over time and declines in others (notably some N&L combinations show reduced diversity relative to others by 2002).
  - Point analysis indicates a shift from unimproved pasture-associated species toward species associated with improved fertility in fertilised plots; improvements in lime-treated plots show a related but distinct grouping.

## Data-driven takeaways and potential data products

- Longitudinal biomass dashboard
  - Time series of above-ground biomass by treatment, block, and year, with breakdown by mowing and fertilisation effects.
- Soil chemistry and productivity map
  - Spatial and temporal plots of soil pH (5 cm depth) and biomass with pH-moisture interactions highlighted; identify treatment-specific optimum ranges and potential stress thresholds.
- Plant community and functional type tracker
  - Visualization of shifts among S, CSR, SR/CSR groups across years and treatments; link to nutrient status and disturbance regime.
- Diversity and composition analytics
  - Tracking Shannon diversity and species-hits composition (e.g., Festuca rubra, Agrostis spp., bryophytes) by treatment to identify drivers of diversity changes.
- Multivariate clustering and PCA dashboards
  - PCA plots by year and treatment to illustrate separation of improved vs unimproved plots; latent vectors highlighting key species driving group differences.
- Data quality and caveats
  - Acknowledge missing years in some plots for certain treatments (e.g., early years) and equipment issues (weather station data gaps) affecting specific 2002 observations.

## Concluding insights

- Management regime strongly shapes plant productivity, composition, and functional traits over four years, with nitrogen and lime together driving the most productive communities but raising questions about long-term moisture and pH balance.
- Removal of grazing and regular mowing foster moss expansion and shift competitive balance toward stress-tolerant and ruderal-leaning communities in unimproved plots.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but require careful interpretation due to intertwined factors (fertility, disturbance, moisture, and site-level dynamics).
- The study demonstrates rich, multi-dimensional data suitable for developing user-focused data products and dashboards to enable end users to explore productivity, community structure, and diversity across treatments and time.
