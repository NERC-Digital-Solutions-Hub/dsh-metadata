# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- A detailed, horizon-by-horizon soil profile description for Block 4, including the sequence LF (0-1 cm) through Cx (approximately 95 cm) with named horizons (LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bsg, Cgx) and accompanying field observations (moisture, root presence, boundary types, grain size indicators, and stone content).
- Laboratory soil analyses by horizon:
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio
  - Exchangeable cations: Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g)
  - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI)
  - pH measurements: pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2)
  - Depth-specific patterns across horizons (e.g., Ah shows high LOI and C content; near-surface acidity; horizons with various stone content)
- Auger samples (0-20+ cm in several sub-sample points) with %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH, etc., to complement profile data at finer depths.
- Vegetation survey data linked to Block 4 plots (e.g., plots 4A–4F) showing species totals and presence/absence patterns across individual plots and subplots.
- ECOTRON site data included for cross-site comparability:
  - Soil analysis for ECOTRON PLOT 1 (weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O and CaCl2)
  - Associated vegetation survey for ECOTRON plots A–F, including species counts and plot-level observations

- Data provenance and identifiers:
  - MLURI Barcodes assigned to each horizon and sample (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and auger samples
  - Clear linkage between soil profiles, auger samples, and vegetation data within Block 4

- Block 5 data excerpt included:
  - Site details for Block 5 and a full soil profile sequence (LF through Cg) with horizon descriptions and depth ranges
  - Comprehensive soil analyses by horizon (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O and CaCl2)
  - Auger sample analyses (5A–5F) with analogous fields (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH)
  - Vegetation survey data for PLOTS 5A–5F with species totals and plot-level occurrences
  - Block 5 plots 5A–5F include finer-grained subplot data (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc) across multiple subplots

- Overall data scope:
  - Combines detailed soil physical-chemical profiling with horizon-level chemical data and multi-plot vegetation surveys across Blocks 4 and 5
  - Integrates with ECOTRON data for cross-site comparison and long-term soil-plant analyses

- Outputs and potential data products:
  - Horizon-level soil property dashboards (e.g., Ca, Mg, K, Na, %N, %C, LOI, pH by horizon and block)
  - Plot- and block-level vegetation dashboards aligned to soil gradients
  - Cross-block comparisons of soil chemistry and pH profiles, LOI, and moisture indicators
  - Integrated data views linking soil profiles to auger data and vegetation composition for self-serve exploration

- Data quality and limitations:
  - Presence of missing or blank fields (noted as ".") in several horizons and sample entries, indicating incomplete data in certain plots or depths
  - Partial sampling in some subplots (e.g., establishment-year data in other sections of the dataset) and potential inconsistencies in horizon coding across blocks
  - High variability in stone content, organic matter indicators, and moisture status across horizons and plots, requiring careful metadata interpretation and normalization for cross-plot analyses

- Relevance for Data Support archetype:
  - Demonstrates a richly multi-layered, self-serve data model combining soil profiles, horizon-specific chemistry, auger sampling, and vegetation data
  - Supports dashboards and analyses that explore relationships between soil properties (acidic surface horizons, LOI, C:N, moisture) and vegetation communities across blocks and plots
  - Emphasizes need for rigorous data lineage, metadata dictionaries, and QA to manage horizon sequences, units, and sample identifiers for longitudinal reuse

- Practical considerations for ongoing data support:
  - Maintain and expand metadata to resolve missing values and clarify horizon naming conventions across Block 4 and Block 5
  - Implement standardized data dictionaries for units (e.g., meq/100 g for cations, LOI percentages, N and C percentages, pH scales)
  - Establish QA checks to harmonize horizon depth records, sampling depths, and lab method consistency
  - Provide cross-linking views that tie soil data to vegetation plots and to ECOTRON datasets for integrated analyses

- Enduring context:
  - Data contribute to the Sourhope field data framework, with long-term soil and vegetation measurements across multiple blocks and integration with ECN and Ecotron programs
  - Supports broader soil-plant-microbial investigations and cross-site comparability within the research network
