# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Context and scope of this data chunk
- Presents detailed soil profiles and associated analyses for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on BLOCK 4, BLOCK 5, and ECOTRON PLOT data.
- Includes soil profile descriptors (depths, colors, textures, structures, roots) and horizon naming (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg).
- Combines soil chemical analyses, moisture metrics, and pH measurements with vegetation survey data for the same plots.
- Captures site details essential for provenance and cross-site comparisons (grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage, parent material).

## Data types and structures
- Soil profiles and horizons:
  - Block 4 and Block 5 horizons with depths (e.g., LF 0-1 cm, FH 1-4 cm, H 4-8 cm, Ah 8-29 cm, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg up to 95 cm or 100 cm).
  - Horizon descriptions include color, texture (sand/silt/clay proportions), structure, moisture state, roots, stones.
- Soil analyses by horizon (Block 4 and Block 5):
  - Parameters: weight (mg), %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Data provided per horizon (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with corresponding MLURI barcodes.
- Auger samples (Block 4 and Block 5 augers):
  - Auger cores labeled 4A–4F and 5A–5F with measurements: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
- Vegetation surveys (Block 4, Block 5, and ECOTRON PLOT):
  - Plot/subplot tallies for species presence/absence, totals by species, and indicator species patterns across plots and blocks.
- Site and governance metadata:
  - Site details (grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material).
  - Sample identifiers (MLURI barcodes) and the association of soil data with the ECN network and archive locations (-80°C storage details in CEH Merlewood).

## Data provenance, identifiers, and storage
- Provenance captured via MLURI barcodes for each horizon and auger sample, ensuring traceability from field collection to laboratory analysis.
- Data organized by blocks (Block 4, Block 5) and sub-collections (augers, horizon analyses, vegetation, ECOTRON plots).
- Central storage and linkages:
  - Managed through MLURI facilities with archiving of physical samples (-80°C) and linked chemical/biological data.
  - Integrated into ECN/Micronet frameworks for long-term monitoring and cross-site synthesis.

## Data formats, metadata, and quality considerations
- Data presented as horizon-by-horizon records and per-augur core records, with explicit depth ranges, soil descriptive terms, and analytical results.
- Variables often reported with explicit units (mg, %, meq/100 g, %LOI, pH values). Some entries are missing (noted as blanks or dots), indicating incomplete coverage across all horizons or cores.
- Horizon nomenclature and boundary descriptions (e.g., sharp smooth boundary, wavy boundary) support reproducibility and cross-year linking.
- Vegetation data are given in plot-specific tallies, enabling temporal and spatial pattern analyses across blocks.

## Governance, access, and reuse implications
- Data stewardship emphasizes traceability, reproducibility, and long-term preservation within ECN/Micronet networks.
- The dataset supports cross-site comparisons and long-term ecological modeling, linking soil chemistry, soil physics, and vegetation community data.
- Open data objectives are foregrounded, but users should note incomplete sampling in some plots and missing values in certain horizons or auger cores.

## Key data stewardship considerations for this dataset
- Maintain robust metadata and standardized identifiers (Block, Horizon, Depth, Horizon code) to enable year-to-year linking.
- Preserve provenance from field collection through lab analyses to final data products; retain method descriptions and sampling dates.
- Ensure archival accessibility of both digital data and physical samples; clearly document barcodes and storage locations.
- Facilitate data sharing within ECN and related networks while honoring site-specific governance and any access constraints.
- Annotate uncertainties and data gaps clearly to support accurate interpretation and cross-site synthesis.

## Endnote
- This data chunk exemplifies comprehensive soil-vegetation field data collection, rigorous provenance, and robust archival practices essential for long-term, multi-site biodiversity and soil-vegetation interaction studies.
