# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Primary monitoring of above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) in relation to five treatments across replicated blocks.
- Three main management effects driving botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and insecticide application; trampling in C2 plots also noted.
- Data and outputs are standardised and presented in reports, maps, and charts; datasets are stored and uploaded to relevant portals for broader access.

## Monitoring design and data collection

- Site and treatments
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site: 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients.
  - Each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells allocated to research groups.
  - Treatments: Control 1, Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (historically called Biocide).
  - Mowing: monthly cuts May–September to ~6 cm (site-wide); insecticide applied after mowing on insecticide plots.
  - Fertilisation: nitrogen and/or lime applied in spring; lime rates very high (approx. 600 g m-2 annually; soil pH trends toward ~7.0 in limed plots).
- Data collection (since 1998–1999)
  - Weather: on-site Automatic Weather Station; headline measures compiled (1999–2002) with occasional data gaps in 2002.
  - Above-ground productivity: 0.5 m2 vegetation samples per sub-plot, collected before each mowing; samples oven-dried and weighed (since 1999).
  - Baseline and annual botanical surveys: 0.5 m2 quadrats (25-point baseline in 1998; 2000–2002 annual point analyses with 100-hole frame per cell).
  - Bryophytes: bryophyte identification enhanced in 2002; overall bryophyte hits tracked (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus increasing across treatments).
  - Soil data: soil pH (5 cm depth) measured since 1998; soil moisture measured (theta probe) in July/August 2002; additional soil measurements in other years as part of site activity.
  - Additional small-scale surveys: biomass per plot, litter hits, and various targeted vegetation surveys.
- Research activity
  - Phase I projects largely finished by 2002; Phase II fieldwork included major 13CO2 pulse experiments and trace-gas measurements using mobile CEH laboratories.

## Key results

- Biomass and productivity
  - 2002 biomass generally lower than 2001 across several treatments, but long-term trend (1999–2002) shows rising biomass across treatments relative to 1999 baseline.
  - Nitrogen and lime fertilisation strongly boosts productivity; plots with both nitrogen and lime yield the highest biomass.
  - Control 2 plots and some less-fertile plots show comparatively lower productivity.
  - A slope-related effect observed: blocks at the lower part of the slope show larger declines in biomass over time.
  - Year x Treatment interactions are statistically significant, underscoring differential responses to fertilisation and management over time.

- Plant composition and functional groups
  - Dominant species: Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis remain prevalent; ongoing declines in these two species since 2000.
  - Mowing favours Festuca rubra over Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp., especially in fertilised plots.
  - Bryophytes, especially Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, expand across the site, notably in unimproved plots; moss abundance is linked to mowing height and lack of grazing.
  - Point Analysis: improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) account for higher hits in fertilised plots; unimproved plots show higher relative bryophyte presence and dicot expansion.
  - Shannon Diversity Index: overall diversity changes over time; 2002 shows a 15% decline in diversity in nitrogen & lime plots relative to baseline, while other treatments show smaller increases or stable values.
  - Functional groups (CSR framework)
    - Stress-tolerators (S), Competitors-Stress-Ruderal (CSR), and Stress-Ruderal/CSR (SR/CSR) dominate. The proportion of these groups shifts by treatment.
    - Nitrogen+Lime plots show a shift toward competitive-stress-ruderal groups; stress-tolerators remain dominant in unimproved plots.
    - Lime and nitrogen+lime treatments reduce SR/CSR representation; unimproved plots benefit stress-tolerators.
  - PCA of point analyses separates plots by treatment and highlights lime-treated plots as a distinct group; some nitrogen plots cluster with limed plots, indicating partial similarity in floristic composition.

- Soil properties and productivity relationships
  - Lime addition produces a highly significant increase in soil pH (near 7.0 in limed plots); nitrogen also raises pH but less strongly.
  - Negative relationship between soil moisture and soil pH; drier plots tend to be more alkaline.
  - Across all plots, higher pH generally correlates with higher biomass, but the relationship weakens or reverses in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime, suggesting a more complex, potentially moisture-limited response.

- Trampling and 13CO2 study
  - The newly surveyed C2 plots in 2002 (distinct from C1) show lower productivity, likely due to trampling during intense activity linked to 13CO2 labeling phases.

## Data quality, accessibility, and context for monitoring

- Data are collected with standardised methods (biomass sampling, point quadrat surveys, soil pH and moisture, weather data) enabling robust year-over-year comparisons and cross-treatment analyses.
- Extensive appendices and datasets accompany the report, including species lists, biomass per plot, rank abundance, bryophyte data, and observational notes; data are designed for uploading to project portals and for reuse by other research groups.
- The long-term data series (1998–2002) supports evaluation of policy-relevant questions about nutrient management, disturbance (grazing vs mowing), and pesticide effects on biodiversity and productivity.

## Endnotes and limitations

- 2002 weather data include periods lost due to a station malfunction; Konza station data substituted for missing dates during July–November 2002 for certain measures.
- Some plots (Control 2) were surveyed less consistently in 2000–2001, affecting direct year-to-year comparability for those plots.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are acknowledged as potentially indirect and context-dependent; causality between reduced herbivory and diversity remains cautiously interpreted.

## Takeaways for environmental monitoring and policy performance

- Fertilisation (N and/or lime) yields the clearest, strongest increases in above-ground productivity, but also drives shifts in community composition and reduces certain diversity metrics in the short term.
- Removal of grazing (through fencing) combined with mowing alters disturbance regimes, promoting stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities; this can reduce some aspects of vascular plant diversity but may stabilize others.
- Functional-group analyses (CSR framework) provide a useful lens for anticipating ecological responses to management changes and nutrient status.
- Mosses and bryophytes increasingly contribute to overall biomass and diversity patterns, highlighting the importance of including non-vascular components in monitored biodiversity.
- Data accessibility and integration with other datasets (e.g., soil nutrient dynamics, climate) are essential for maximizing the value of monitoring datasets and informing policy-relevant environmental assessments.
