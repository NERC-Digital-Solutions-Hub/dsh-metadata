# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large-field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) examining soil biodiversity and related plant/biomass responses under different treatments (control, nitrogen, lime, nitrogen+lime, biocide).
- Data collected 1999–2001 to provide context for detailed studies, with monitoring aligned to Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998).
- Data management and governance considerations include consistent measurement protocols, data normalization, and documentation of methodological changes and site disruptions (Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions in 2001).

## Data collection and management
- Measurements and dates are documented in Table 1; key data types:
  - Automatic Weather Station (headlines for 2001)
  - Above-ground biomass (seasonal cuts May–Sep; five mowing occasions per year)
  - Soil pH (upper 5 cm; pre-baseline and Oct 2001)
  - Botanical composition via Point Analysis surveys (July 2001; species hits per quadrat)
- Data handling and analysis:
  - Biomass data were ln-transformed for ANOVA; results reported as treatment effects and year interactions.
  - Biomass normalized against a control (C1) to compare treatment impacts across years.
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) used to explore species composition shifts.
  - ANOVA (Genstat 5) assessed treatment, year, and block effects; LSD tests used for within-year significance.
- Documentation and provenance:
  - Species codes and survey methodology provided (Appendix includes species list and codes).
  - Weather data transmitted to CEH Data Manager; site records maintained by MLURI/Sourhope staff.
- Site disruptions/policy:
  - 2001 FMD restrictions limited site access (Feb–May); work conducted under an agreed timetable and vet protocol.
  - Change of site officer in 2001; minor impact on data collection cadence and personnel.

## Results highlights

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather within long-term norms; rainfall near average after a very wet previous year.
- Radiation stable; slight reduction in mean temperatures; soil moisture modestly higher than prior years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak biomass typically in July/August.
- 2001 biomass higher than earlier years, likely due to staff change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Normalized biomass indicates nitrogen and lime inputs boost productivity; nitrogen+lime often the strongest promoter.
- ANOVA indicates significant treatment effects and year-by-treatment interactions; no strong block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime markedly raises surface pH; October 2001 pH: limed plots ~6.19; nitrogen+lime plots ~6.38.
- Nitrogen alone also increases pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots show little change since baseline (Aug 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 surveys show higher total hits than 2000 across treatments, suggesting increased sward density (likely grazing removal since 1998).
- Distinct species shifts by treatment:
  - Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis increase in fertilized plots; Agrostis capillaris declines across treatments.
  - Improved plots (N and/or lime) show more species associated with enhanced pastures; unimproved plots retain species typical of less fertile sites.
- Diversity trends:
  - 24 species identified in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime plots, suggesting possible diversity decline with strong improving treatments.
- Multivariate analysis:
  - PCA separates nitrogen and/or lime plots from controls/biocide plots; control/biocide plots cluster with less fertile-associated species.
  - Biomass increases correlate with higher frequencies of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines seen for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with higher biomass.
  - Litter frequency increases in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site heterogeneity
- Spatial variation observed across site columns; some columns show more acidic plots, particularly with nitrogen and/or lime in certain columns.
- Biomass distribution shows higher values in centrally located plots; strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass by blocks, though spatial patterns suggest local heterogeneity influences outcomes.

## Data quality, limitations, and governance notes
- Consistency checks: surveyors demonstrated no significant differences in 2001 botanical surveying between observers.
- Method changes and their implications:
  - 2001 shift from manual cutting to mechanized cutting likely inflated biomass, necessitating normalization against C1 for year-to-year comparability.
  - First biocide application in May 2001 missed; overall management activities otherwise followed the 2001 Site Management Plan.
- Access and continuity considerations due to FMD restrictions; documentation of protocols ensures traceability of any data gaps.
- Data products include: annual and cumulative biomass (1999–2001), soil pH trends, weather metrics, and species-hits matrices with corresponding biomass relationships.
