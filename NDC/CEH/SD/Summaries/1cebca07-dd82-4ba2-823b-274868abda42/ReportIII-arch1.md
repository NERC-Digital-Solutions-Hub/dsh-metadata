# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Baseline context established in 1998; comprehensive monitoring to aid cross-project comparisons and year-to-year links.
  - 2001 management and access were affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May) and a change of site Officer; most site activities (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) proceeded under a formal 2001 Site Management Plan; one biocide application in May was missed.

- 2. RESULTS

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather largely unremarkable: rainfall near the long-term average, radiation similar to prior years, and slightly cooler average temperatures.
    - Soil moisture modestly higher than in previous years.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak production typically in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 1999–2000, likely due to a combination of changes in personnel and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
    - Biomass data normalized against C1 (control) to compare year-to-year effects.
    - Statistical findings (split-plot ANOVA, ln-transformed biomass):
      - Significant differences between improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) versus unimproved plots.
      - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
      - No significant differences between blocks.
    - Key interpretation: nitrogen and lime (especially in combination) consistently boost above-ground biomass; methodological change in 2001 may have inflated absolute biomass totals.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Liming continues to raise surface soil pH (0–5 cm).
    - October 2001 means: limed plots ≈ 6.19; nitrogen+lime plots ≈ 6.38; nitrogen alone raises pH modestly; control plots show no significant change since baseline (1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Quadrat survey (consistency check): similar sampling protocol to 2000; two surveyors each covered about half of quadrats; no significant inter-surveyor difference.
    - Overall intensity: 58% more hits in 2001 than 2000, suggesting denser sward, potentially due to grazing removal after 1998.
    - Species-level shifts by treatment (relative abundance):
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments; most abundant in Control and Limed plots in 2001.
      - Festuca spp. (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; especially Festuca rubra in Nitrogen and Lime plots, and Festuca ovina in Nitrogen and Biocide plots.
      - Improved plots (N and/or L) show more of Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra; unimproved plots retain species typical of less fertile pastures (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
    - Diversity implications:
      - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen+Lime plots, suggesting a potential moderation of species richness with the strongest fertility/liming treatments.
    - Multivariate analysis:
      - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separates nitrogen-and/or-lime plots from control/biocide plots.
      - Improved plots show greater association with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, and Holcus mollis.
      - Within unimproved plots, species such as Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, and Anthoxanthum odoratum are more prevalent.
    - Biomass–species relationships:
      - Positive correlations: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis with higher biomass.
      - Negative correlations: Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with increasing biomass.
      - Increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots indicates faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

- 3. SITE HETEROGENEITY

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) show more acidic plots, with a tilt toward lower pH in nitrogen and/or lime improved columns in these areas.
    - This spatial pattern is partly confounded by treatment composition in those columns (more controls/biocide there).

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Some plots are outliers with low biomass; central plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen+Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass across plots.
    - No significant differences in biomass between blocks (ANOVA: F = 0.69, p = 0.61).

- Acknowledgements and additional notes
  - Acknowledges personnel and site staff contributions; numerous data collection activities and schedules (e.g., mowing, point quadrats, relative cover surveys, minirhizotron work, and weather data).
  - Data tables and figures underpinning the results include annual biomass measurements, ANOVA results, PCA loadings, and species-abundance rankings.

- Implications for analysis and decision-making
  - Fertilization and liming (N and/or L) consistently enhance biomass and shift species composition toward more productive grasses, with associated soil pH changes.
  - Management changes (staffing, switch to mechanical cutting) can substantially affect measured biomass and should be accounted for when comparing across years.
  - Spatial heterogeneity within the site is non-trivial and can influence both biomass and species composition; future analyses should control for or explicitly model this heterogeneity (e.g., via columns/block structure, pH gradients).
  - Data quality checks (inter-observer agreement for botanical surveys) support reliability of the 2001 survey results, but ongoing cross-checks are advisable in multi-year datasets.
