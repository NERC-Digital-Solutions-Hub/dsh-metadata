# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at Sourhope, MDURI farm, Scottish Borders.
- Aimed to provide a broad context for more detailed studies across multiple groups; baseline data survey completed November 1998.
- 2001 management impacted by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change of site manager; most activities continued under a formal site management plan.

## Key Results

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 weather: rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to prior years; slightly cooler temperatures; higher average soil moisture than 2000.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak biomass in July/August.
  - 2001 biomass higher than earlier years, likely due to personnel changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass increased more with nitrogen and/or lime; significant treatment-by-year interaction; no significant block differences.
  - Normalising by the C1 treatment confirms continued positive impact of nitrogen and lime on productivity.

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Liming raised surface pH (5 cm depth) to about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots by October 2001.
  - Nitrogen alone also raised pH but less than lime; control plots showed little change since 1998 baseline.

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - Point Quadrat surveys showed no significant surveyor differences in 2001.
  - Total hits were 58% higher in 2001 than 2000, indicating increased sward density (likely due to removal of grazing stock in 1998).
  - Fertilised plots (N and/or Lime) shifted species composition toward Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, and other species associated with improved pastures.
  - Nitrogen+Lime plots showed the strongest shift; unimproved plots retained species like Agrostis capillaris, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Diversity tended to be higher in unimproved treatments (24 species in Control/Biocide vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime).
  - Principal Components Analysis separated fertilised plots from unimproved plots; increases in litter and turnover were associated with higher fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Spatial patterning observed: columns E and F tended to be more acidic; underlying spatial heterogeneity across the site affects pH in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots.

- 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
  - Biomass varied by location: higher biomass in centrally located plots (e.g., Nitrogen+Lime 2E, Lime 2C, Biocide 2D, Control 1 2B).
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences between blocks.

## Data collection and methods (context for data leadership)
- Main measurements included: automatic weather data, above-ground biomass (five summer cuts per year, 0.5 m2 sub-plots, dried biomass), soil pH (top 5 cm, post-treatment), and botanical composition via July point quadrats (100 5 cm cells, 25 pins per cell).
- 1998–2001: data collection schedule recorded; 2001 mowing used a mix of manual and mechanical methods; one biocide application was missed in May 2001 due to operational issues.
- Weather data transmitted to the project data manager; cross-checks showed consistent data collection across surveyors.

## Notes on data context for strategy and governance
- Demonstrates how data from multiple, linked sub-studies (biomass, chemistry, botany, weather) can reveal treatment effects and site heterogeneity.
- Highlights the importance of documenting management changes, external disruptions (e.g., FMD), and equipment/shifts (manual vs mechanical mowing) for data interpretation.
- Underlines value of standardized protocols and cross-checks (e.g., surveyor consistency, PCA analyses) to ensure data quality and comparability across years.
