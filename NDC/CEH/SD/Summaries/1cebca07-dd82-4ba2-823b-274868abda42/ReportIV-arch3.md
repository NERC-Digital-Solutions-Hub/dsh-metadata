# SUMMARY

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on intensive study at Sourhope to understand soil biodiversity and its functional roles, linking below- and above-ground processes.
  - Primary monitoring targets: above-ground biomass productivity, species composition, and relative abundance (diversity); aim to inform policy scrutiny and future decisions through robust, long-term data.

- Site, design and management
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots across 0.5 m2 cells.
  - Treatments (applied to fertilised vs unfertilised subsets) and controls:
    - Control 1 (no treatment)
    - Control 2 (no treatment)
    - Nitrogen (NH4NO3)
    - Lime (CaCO3)
    - Nitrogen & Lime
    - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA; relabeled Biocide in some sections)
  - Yearly management since 1999: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept), followed by insecticide applications in insecticide plots; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime to designated plots.
  - Baseline prior to treatments: 1998 botanical survey; grazing removed in 1998; five summer cuts established from 1999 onward.

- Data collection and methods
  - Weather and site data: ongoing on-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999 (temperature, rainfall, radiation, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground productivity: regular harvests from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells; samples dried and weighed; baseline and multi-year data (1999–2002).
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998 25-point quadrat; repeated July/August point analyses in 2000, 2001, 2002 (including bryophyte identification in 2002); additional small-scope vegetation and biomass surveys.
  - Soil measurements: soil pH measured since 1998 (~5 cm depth); soil moisture measured in 2002 via theta probe; additional soil tests throughout.
  - Data handling and analysis: split-plot ANOVA (treatment, year, and interactions); LSD post-hoc tests; PCA on point-analysis data; multiple appendices detailing species lists and treatment maps.

- Key findings on plant productivity and community composition
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Nitrogen plus Lime (N&L) plots show the strongest biomass production; lime or nitrogen alone provide smaller gains; Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1.
    - 2002 biomass declined relative to 2001 across most treatments, with block slope effects (lower productivity in some blocks, especially block 1 and block 5).
    - Long-term trend from 1999–2002 shows overall biomass increase across treatments compared with 1999 starting point.
  - Soil pH, moisture and productivity
    - Lime addition markedly raises soil pH toward ~7.0; nitrogen gives a smaller rise; control plots remain near baseline.
    - Higher soil pH generally associates with higher biomass production when considering all plots, though treatment-specific patterns vary.
    - Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH; higher pH plots tend to be drier, which can influence productivity, particularly under combined N and lime treatment.
  - Plant functional groups (CSR framework)
    - Functional groups tracked: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderals (CSR), and SR/CSR.
    - Across years, nitrogen and lime plots show expansion of competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and related groups; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerant (S) species.
    - In 2000–2002, CSR-rich communities become more dominant in fertilised plots; SR/CSR components are reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
  - Species composition shifts (point analysis)
    - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) show higher relative hits of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots remain dominated by Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
    - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline by >40% since 2000 across treatments, suggesting a site-wide mowing effect rather than a single-treatment effect.
    - Bryophytes, especially Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, increase across the site and are more prevalent in unimproved plots; bryophyte contribution to total hits rose from 6–11% (2000–2001) to ~20% (2002).
    - Shannon diversity indices decline in nitrogen-and-lime plots by 2002, while other treatments show increases or smaller declines; overall, diversity responses are treatment- and year-dependent.
    - PCA and treatment-ranked analyses separate improved vs unimproved plots; key species associated with higher fertility (e.g., Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra) vs less fertile conditions (e.g., Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp., Luzula spp., certain bryophytes).
    - Bryophyte species respond variably to treatments; many bryophytes are less abundant in nitrogen- or lime-amended plots.
  - Trampling and insecticide effects
    - Trampling in C2 plots (associated with 13CO2 pulse experiments) likely suppressed vegetation growth, contributing to observed productivity declines in 2002.
    - Insecticide (soil insecticide exposure) patterns mirror historical findings where herbivore exclusion can increase certain plant groups, but clear causal links to diversity require caution due to complex plant–insect interactions.

- Implications for monitoring and data governance
  - Longitudinal, multi-factor field experiments with replicated blocks and standardized sampling enable robust assessment of policy-relevant environmental health measures, including productivity, species composition, and functional trait shifts.
  - The CSR framework provides a meaningful lens to interpret how disturbance (mowing, herbivory), nutrient status (N, lime), and biotic interactions shape community function and biodiversity.
  - Data richness supports integration across above- and below-ground processes, but challenges include:
    - Data gaps and missing data due to equipment issues (e.g., 2002 weather station period losses).
    Data governance considerations observed in the programme:
    - Need for consistent metadata, data provenance, and standardized data sharing across projects.
    - Public sharing of underlying data can be a barrier; documentation and data management standards must be set at source, enabling transparent reporting and reuse.
  - Policy-relevant takeaways for monitoring frameworks:
    - Track both productivity (biomass yield) and diversity (Shannon index) over time, with attention to functional group dynamics (CSR classifications) to anticipate shifts under different management regimes.
    - Monitor soil pH and moisture as key mediators of vegetation responses to fertilisation and disturbance.
    - Include bryophyte dynamics as indicators of changes in disturbance regime and sward structure.
    - Clearly document treatment effects on species composition to avoid misattributing shifts to single factors; incorporate interaction terms (year × treatment) in analyses.
    - Ensure robust data governance, metadata quality, and data accessibility to support policy evaluation and future decision-making.
