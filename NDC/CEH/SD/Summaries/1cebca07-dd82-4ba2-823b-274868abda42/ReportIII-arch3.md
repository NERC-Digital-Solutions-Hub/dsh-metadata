# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The Sourhope field experiment is part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at the Macaulay Institute’s Sourhope farm in the Scottish Borders. Its aim is to provide a broad monitoring context for more detailed studies and to enable year-to-year comparisons across measured variables (weather, biomass, soil chemistry, and botanical composition).

- Monitoring scope and data collection
  - Measurements tracked include:
    - Automatic Weather Station data (rainfall, radiation, temperature, soil moisture)
    - Above-ground biomass across plots and treatments, with five summer harvests per year and normalization to a baseline (C1)
    - Soil pH in the top 5 cm, showing effects of lime and nitrogen on soil chemistry
    - Botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys and species abundance analyses
  - Data collection schedule and methods were documented (1998–2001), with adjustments made during 2001 due to external events and staff changes.
  - Data handling and reporting: results are presented to facilitate cross-year comparisons and links to other data (e.g., biomass vs species abundance), with statistical analyses (ANOVA, PCA) applied to assess treatment effects and year-to-year changes.

- Key results by measure
  - Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - 2001 weather near long-term averages: rainfall ~839 mm; radiation ~3473 MJ m-2; average air temperatures around 7.3–7.7°C; higher soil moisture (0.37 m3 m-3) than previous years.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass across years; peak biomass in July–August each year.
    - 2001 biomass markedly higher than 1999–2000, attributed partly to a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears and staffing changes.
    - All improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) yielded higher biomass than unimproved plots; nitrogen plus lime (N&L) gave the strongest biomass promotion.
    - Statistical analyses show significant differences between improved vs non-improved plots and a significant year–treatment interaction.
  - Soil pH
    - Lime addition continued to raise topsoil pH; October 2001 pH averaged 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in N&L plots.
    - Nitrogen alone also increased soil pH, but to a lesser extent; control plots showed little change since baseline (1998).
  - Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Quadrat results mirrored July 2000 in survey protocol; however, total hits were 58% higher in 2001 than in 2000, indicating greater sward density.
    - Treatment effects: Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments, especially in fertilized plots.
    - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more indicators of improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and fewer less-fertile-associated species (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
    - Species richness: unimproved treatments contained 24 species; fertilized/improved plots contained 18 species, suggesting a potential initial decline in diversity with strong fertility/liming.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicates clear separation of improved plots from unimproved ones; regression of major species against biomass shows Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively associated with biomass, while Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis decline as biomass increases.
    - Increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots suggests faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
  
- Site heterogeneity
  - Spatial variation observed across the site:
    - Columns E and F exhibited comparatively more acidic plots than others, likely due to slope orientation and plot composition (more Control/Biocide plots in those columns).
    - Biomass variation showed central plots often having higher cumulative biomass; a positive correlation exists between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - Overall, spatial heterogeneity is an important factor to account for in analyses and interpretation of treatment effects.

- Management events and data governance
  - 2001 Field management was affected by the Foot and Mouth disease outbreak, restricting site access February–May 2001. Access was later resumed under strict protocols and veterinary oversight.
  - The site officer in charge changed in May 2001.
  - Data collection continued with protocols to ensure consistency, and weather data were actively transmitted to the central data manager.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - The study demonstrates clear, measurable responses to nutrient and liming treatments across biomass, soil chemistry, and botanical composition, with year-to-year variability and treatment-by-year interactions.
  - biodiversity indicators may shift with management treatments (e.g., fertility increases favored Festuca and Poa species, with a potential early decline in overall species richness on highly improved plots).
  - Spatial heterogeneity within a site can influence treatment outcomes and should be integrated into experimental design and data interpretation.
  - Robust data governance, metadata, and sharing practices are vital, given the complexity of multi-measure monitoring and the need to link site-level data with broader research programs.
