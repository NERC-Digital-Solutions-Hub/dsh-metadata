# SUMMARY

## Context and Purpose
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) focusing on aboveground biomass production, plant composition, and diversity within a large field experiment.
- Experimental site features five replicate blocks with six main plots each, subdivided into ten sub-plots, plus a 0.5 m2 cell system for data collection.
- Five treatments largely separating fertilised (nitrogen and/or lime) from unfertilised plots; management also includes regular mowing and an insecticide application.
- Aims include understanding links between soil biodiversity and above-ground plant communities, and documenting how management actions influence productivity and diversity.

## Data Collected and Datasets
- Above-ground biomass: plant productivity measured annually from 1999–2002, using five summer cuts per year, with samples taken from random 0.5 m2 cells; biomass weights oven-dried for analysis.
- Botanical surveys: baseline survey in 1998; extended point analysis surveys in 2000, 2001, and 2002 using a 0.5 m2 cell with a 100-hole grid; bryophytes identified to species level in 2002.
- Soil data: soil pH measured at ~5 cm depth since 1998; soil moisture measured in 2002 using a theta probe at survey cells.
- Weather data: site on-site Automatic Weather Station documenting temperature, rainfall, radiation, and moisture variables since Feb 1999.
- Species lists and abundances: Appendix 3 provides a full vascular plant and bryophyte species list for 2002; Appendix 8 documents rank-abundance changes across years.
- Data volumes: total soil samples collected since project start = 11,621.
- Data quality notes: 2002 data include adjustments for a weather-station malfunction; missing weeks were substituted with data from a nearby station (Konza) for certain variables.

## Experimental Design and Data Structure
- Design: 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradient; within each block, 6 main plots randomly assigned to treatments; plots subdivided into sub-plots used by different research groups.
- Treatments include: Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (formerly Biocide; Dursban 4 OPA) applied after mowing.
- Data types organized by year, treatment, block, plot, sub-plot, and sampling event (e.g., biomass harvests, point analyses).

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Metadata
- 2002 is the main year with more extensive analyses (biomass, point analysis, and bryophyte data); some measurements (e.g., soil moisture) were added or collected selectively.
- Weather data gaps in 2002 due to a malfunction; missing periods (July–November) were substituted with data from nearby station; some data sections are explicitly noted as missing.
- Appendix 2 provides precise management dates and rates for each treatment (N, Lime, N&L, Insecticide) across years.
- Appendix 5 documents headline weather measures and notes data gaps; Appendix 6–8 provide detailed biomass and biodiversity outputs by plot and year.

## Access, Availability, and Provenance
- Core project data and methods are described in the published report; full project details are accessible via the Soil Biodiversity website or by contacting the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (Windermere Road, Grange-over-Sands, UK).
- Appendix materials (site activity, species lists, weather data, biomass tables, PCA results) accompany the report and constitute the primary data provenance.

## Key Findings Relevant to Data Stewardship
- Fertilisation (N and/or lime) consistently increases above-ground biomass; combined N+L yields the strongest productivity, though signs of potential peak or moisture-related stress emerge in some plots.
- Regular mowing without grazing tends to favor stress-tolerant and moss-dominated communities, with bryophyte abundance rising across treatments, particularly in unfertilised plots.
- Insecticide treatment relationships with diversity are inconclusive; observed shifts in species composition may reflect indirect effects via herbivory changes or broader environmental conditions.
- Plant functional group dynamics (stress-tolerators, competitive-stress ruderals, and their combinations) shift with fertilisation and disturbance regime; N+L plots show advances of competitive/ruderal types, while unimproved plots favor stress-tolerators.
- Community composition changes are captured by point analyses and biomass data, with multivariate PCA revealing clear grouping by fertility status and treatment.
- Regional slope position influences productivity, with the lowest productivity observed at upslope blocks in some years.
- Comprehensive data allow temporal trend analyses (1999–2002) and cross-year comparisons, but data gaps must be accounted for in longitudinal analyses.

## Governance and Stewardship Considerations
- Ensure long-term preservation of multi-year datasets with clear metadata: sampling protocols (0.5 m2 cell, 100-point grid), biomass processing (oven-drying at 80°C, weight measurements), soil sampling depth and pH methods, and weather station configurations.
- Maintain explicit links between treatments, plot IDs, years, and sampling events; document any data substitutions (e.g., weather data) and justify with provenance notes.
- Capture data quality flags and gaps (e.g., 2002 weather station outage) in metadata to support robust, bias-aware analyses.
- Provide access to data via a central repository (as per Soil Biodiversity website) with stable identifiers and versioning; include appendices as data packages for reproducibility.
- Include clear data dictionaries: variable definitions, units, sampling dates, and processing steps to support reuse by data stewards and external researchers.
