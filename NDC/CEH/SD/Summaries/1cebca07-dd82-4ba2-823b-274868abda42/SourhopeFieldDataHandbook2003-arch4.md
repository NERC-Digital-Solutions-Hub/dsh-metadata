# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Documents soil and vegetation data for Sourhope field sites, focusing on detailed soil profiles, laboratory analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys across Blocks 4 and 5, plus ECOTRON plots.
- Provides site context (grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage), horizon-level soil descriptions, quantitative soil chemistry/physical properties, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2), and horizon-specific metadata.
- Includes vegetation inventories by plot/subplot, species totals, and presence/absence data, linked to soil data for cross-system analyses.
- Uses standardized MLURI barcodes, horizon naming (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.), and provides associated weight data, sample IDs, and detailed results for future archiving and reuse.

## Data assets and scope for data leadership

- Core data types
  - Soil profiles by horizon for blocks 4 and 5 (depths 0–100 cm+), with descriptive text for each horizon.
  - Horizon-level soil analyses: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Auger sample analyses (4A–4F, 5A–5F): %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Vegetation surveys by plot/subplot (plots 4A–4F, 5A–5F) with species totals and presence/absence indicators.
  - ECOTRON plot data: soil analysis and vegetation survey.
- Site context
  - SITE DETAILS: grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material, and general soil subgroups.
  - Block-level organization and sampling design (e.g., horizons sampled, plot/subplot layout) to support cross-site comparisons.

## Structure and content by area

- Block 4
  - Soil profile descriptions by horizon (LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx) with texture, color, structure, roots, stones, and boundaries.
  - Soil analyses by horizon (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx) including weights, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Auger samples (4A–4F) with %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH values.
  - Vegetation data (plots 4A–4F) with species counts by subplots and total species counts per plot; presence/absence for key taxa.
- Block 5
  - Soil profile descriptions from 0–100 cm for various horizons (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with detailed soil morphology and stone content.
  - Soil analyses by horizon and auger samples (5A–5F) covering similar variables as Block 4.
  - Auger sample results include %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH in H2O and CaCl2.
  - Vegetation data (plots 5A–5F) with subplot-level species totals and presence/absence across multiple taxa.
- ECOTRON PLOT
  - Soil analysis data for ECOTRON plot horizon(s) and a corresponding vegetation survey, enabling comparison with field blocks.
- Site details and context
  - Block 5 site details (grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage) and major soil subgroup (Brown forest soil with gleying), along with parent material and rock types.
  - Cross-block consistency in horizon labeling and sampling approach to support integration with other Sourhope data.

## Measurement, data quality, and metadata

- Variables and units
  - Soil chemistry/physical properties: %N, %C, C:N, Ca (meq/100g), Na (meq/100g), K (meq/100g), Mg (meq/100g), %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Physical descriptors: horizon color (Rock color codes), texture descriptors, structure (blocky, granular), moisture status, root abundance, presence of stones.
  - Vegetation: species tallies by subplots, presence/absence data, and totals per plot.
- Data quality notes
  - Some missing values (e.g., Na in several horizon samples) and block-to-block variability observed.
  - Anomalies noted in Block 4–5 data; data quality relies on standardized sampling protocols, documentation, and cross-referencing with horizon descriptions.
- Metadata and archiving
  - Data tied to MLURI barcodes for each horizon and horizon-specific samples.
  - Sample weights recorded (mg) for horizon samples; comprehensive metadata accompanying samples (depth, horizon names, block identifiers, plot/subplot design).
  - Data archiving at -80°C and storage in designated repositories (e.g., CEH Merlewood for soil samples).

## Access, governance, and interoperability

- Data governance
  - Clear sample identifiers, horizon documentation, and block-level metadata to support long-term reuse and cross-study synthesis.
  - Emphasis on standardized metadata, consistent sampling protocols, and explicit data ownership to enable cross-project data sharing.
- Data sharing and integration
  - Data are organized to facilitate integration with vegetation analyses and soil chemistry across blocks and plots, enabling system-wide analyses (soil–vegetation interactions, biodiversity monitoring).
  - ECOTRON data provide a controlled-environment counterpart for cross-site comparability and methodological consistency.
- Implications for data leadership
  - Demonstrates the importance of end-to-end data governance for long-term ecological data: from field sampling design and horizon-level measurements to archiving, metadata, and cross-domain analyses.
  - Highlights need for standardized data schemas, interoperable Horizon labels, and centralized repositories to support multi-site collaborations and data-driven decision making.

## Key takeaways for data leadership and strategy

- The Sourhope data exemplify a multi-layer data system linking site context, soil chemistry/physical properties, and vegetation data across multiple blocks and experimental conditions.
- Effective data leadership should promote:
  - System-wide data thinking (linking soil profiles, chemistry, and vegetation in a coherent model).
  - Clear metadata and data provenance to support user needs and co-ownership across research groups.
  - Standardization of sampling methods, horizon labeling, and data formats to enable cross-site comparisons and network-level analyses.
  - Robust data governance, archiving practices, and centralized access strategies to ensure long-term availability and reuse.
- Collaboration and communities of practice (e.g., ECN) benefit from shared data standards and transparent data products, as demonstrated by these Sourhope datasets.
