# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Large-scale field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Aimed at providing a broad, contextual, multi-study data framework to help researchers compare across years and link with other datasets.
  - Detailed measurements across weather, biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community composition to support diverse analyses and data self-service.

- Data types and data collection
  - Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather near long-term averages: rainfall ~839 mm (2001), radiation ~3473 MJ m-2, average temperatures around 7.3–7.7°C, soil moisture ~0.37 m3 m-3.
    - Data collected continuously and transmitted to a central data manager.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Five mowing events per summer; biomass harvested from random 0.5 m2 cells per sub-plot, dried, and weighed.
    - Data used to produce annual and monthly biomass figures; log-transformations applied for ANOVA.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 2000 across treatments, partly attributed to staffing changes and switch from manual to mechanical cutting.
  - Soil pH
    - Upper 5 cm soil pH measured; lime application raised pH substantially (e.g., limed plots ~6.19; nitrogen-plus-lime plots ~6.38 by Oct 2001).
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent; control plots showed little change since baseline (1998).
  - Botanical composition (Point Quadrat Survey)
    - July surveys (2000 and 2001) recorded species hits across plots; 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in improved plots (suggesting diversity changes with treatments).
    - Species-level shifts: Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased; fertilised plots favored Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in untreated plots.
    - PCA showed clear separation of nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots tended to be more uniform with bryophytes and certain grasses.
    - Biomass and species abundance correlations: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively related to biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes tended to decline as biomass increased; increased litter in N/ Lime plots indicated faster vegetation turnover.

- Key results by topic
  - Treatments and biomass
    - Clear hierarchy in biomass across treatments; nitrogen and/or lime increased biomass relative to controls and biocide.
    - A significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
    - Normalizing to C1 enabled assessment of sustained positive effects of nitrogen and lime on productivity.
  - Soil pH and fertility
    - Lime raised surface soil pH consistently; nitrogen also raised pH modestly; control plots remained near baseline pH.
  - Botanical community changes
    - Increased overall plant density in 2001, with higher “hits” across most species, indicating denser sward due to reduced grazing sometime earlier (1998).
    - Fertilised plots showed a shift toward species associated with improved pastures (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis); unimproved plots retained more Bryophyte-rich and Nardus/Nardus-like communities.
    - Species richness declined in the most improved plots (24 species in unimproved vs 18 in improved), suggesting reduced diversity with nutrient enrichment and liming.
  - Multivariate analyses and plant–biomass relationships
    - PCA demonstrated distinct community profiles for treated vs untreated plots.
    - Biomass increases correlated with shifts toward more productive grasses; higher turnover litter in fertilised plots aligned with higher soil fertility.

- Site heterogeneity
  - Spatial variation observed: columns on the right-facing slope showed more acidic plots, especially in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated columns.
  - Biomass distribution varied with location: higher biomass often in more centrally located plots; lower biomass in some outlying plots.
  - Strong positive relationship between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant differences among blocks.

- Data collection context and quality considerations
  - There were site-management disruptions in 2001 due to Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (visitor access limited Feb–May 2001; subsequent sampling governed by veterinary protocol).
  - Change of site officer in 2001 may have influenced sampling and handling; biomass measurements in 2001 likely affected by the shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Methods included standardized mowing, quadrat sampling, and point quadrats with consistent surveying personnel to ensure comparability (no significant inter-surveyor differences in 2001).
  - Data handling: biomass data subjected to log-transformation for ANOVA; multiple tables include detailed ANOVA results and species-level hit counts to support reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.

- Implications for data use
  - The dataset provides a robust, multi-year, multi-treatment platform suitable for cross-study integration, trend analysis, and linking with other components of the Soil Biodiversity program.
  - Users should account for methodological changes (e.g., mowing method) when comparing across years.
  - Data illustrate how fertility and liming influence biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community structure, with clear spatial heterogeneity to consider in spatial analyses.

- Appendix and references
  - Table 1 documents data collection events; Tables 3–6 and Figures 1–9 summarize weather, biomass, soil pH, species composition, PCA results, and biomass vs. species correlations.
  - Species codes and botanical survey methodology are defined for consistent interpretation across analyses.
