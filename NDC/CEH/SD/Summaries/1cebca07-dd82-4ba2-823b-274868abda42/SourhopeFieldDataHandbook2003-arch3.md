  - LF: 0–1 cm; FH: 1–4 cm; H: 4–8 cm; Ah: 8–29 cm; Abg: 29–40 cm; B sg: 40–61 cm; C gx: 61–95 cm.
- Horizon characteristics:
  - LF and FH: fibrous, moist, no mineral grains; abundant fine/fleshy roots.
  - H: black colour, amorphous; weak blocky structure; roots present.
  - Ah to AB horizons: dark to pinkish grey colours; sandy silt loam to coarse sandy silt loam textures; structured horizons with varying mottling; abundant fine roots; presence of igneous stones (andesite) particularly in deeper horizons.
  - Bs/Cx horizons: sandy/clay loams with mottles; moderate to strong structuring; roots diminish with depth.
- Stones and mineral content:
  - Abundant very small igneous stones throughout Ah to Cx; varied distribution of andesite stones.

## Block 5 – Site details and soil profiles (Rigg Foot, Sourhope)

- Site details (Block 5):
  - Grid reference NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; imperfect drainage; major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying.
  - Rock type: undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
- Soil profile (Block 5):
  - Depths: LF 0–1 cm; FH 1–5 cm; H 5–7 cm; Ah 7–25 cm; AB 25–35 cm; Bg 35–49 cm; BCg 49–70 cm; Cg 70–100 cm.
  - Horizon descriptions: similar to Block 4 with fibrous to semi-fibrous textures; Ah horizon rich in organic matter; presence of igneous stones (andesite) and clear horizon boundaries.
  - Soil colour and texture transitions: dark Ah horizon transitioning to grey-brown ABg and redder Bg/BCg horizons; clay loam textures with mottling and varying structure.

  - Data per horizon (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition; pH (H2O) and pH CaCl2.
  - Notable observations:
    - Ah horizons consistently more enriched in carbon and nitrogen than shallower horizons, with C:N ratios around 10–15 in several horizons.
    - Exchangeable Ca and other cations show block-to-block variation, with some horizons highly weathered and acidic (low pH values around 3.8–4.5 in CaCl2).
    - Soil moisture loss and LOI indicate substantial organic matter in Ah and Bg horizons, decreasing in deeper mineral horizons.
- Auger samples (Block 5):
  - Analyzed sub-samples 5A–5F for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition; pH (H2O) and pH CaCl2.

## Data governance, openness, and governance barriers (implicit in the material)

- Barcoding and archival references:
  - MLURI barcodes accompany horizon samples and auger samples, enabling traceability and long-term data integrity.
- Data depth and openness:
  - Rich, multi-parameter datasets (N, C, C:N, exchangeable cations, moisture, LOI, pH) across horizons and plots; data intended for integration into longer-term monitoring and policy-relevant analyses.
- Governance considerations:
  - Emphasizes standardized metadata, cross-project compatibility, and the importance of data sharing for policy use while noting potential barriers (e.g., data sharing practices, metadata completeness, and dataset interoperability).

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks

- Illustrates a comprehensive, replicated field-monitoring approach across soil and vegetation metrics, enabling policy-relevant insights into environmental health.
- Key environmental health measures demonstrated:
  - Vegetation composition and indicator species (plot-level and subplot-level data).
  - Soil chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na), soil moisture characteristics, organic matter indicators (LOI), and soil acidity (pH H2O and CaCl2).
  - Depth-resolved horizon data linking soil properties to vegetation patterns and management histories.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - High-quality data processing (e.g., consistent horizon coding, data archiving, and governance).
  - Metadata completeness for cross-study comparability.
  - Openness versus data-sharing barriers as a consideration for policy-engaged monitoring frameworks.
- Provides baseline for long-term environmental change monitoring, cross-project analyses, and the refinement of management and policy decisions based on integrated soil-vegetation indicators.
