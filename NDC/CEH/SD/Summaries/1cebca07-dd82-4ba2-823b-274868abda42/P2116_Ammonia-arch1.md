# Bacterial community structure and soil process data from a sewage sludge amended upland grassland soil experiment, 2000 [NERC Soil Biodiversity Programme]

## Aim and context
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (1999–2000) studying soil biota diversity and functional roles in key ecological processes.
- Focuses on how soil improvement treatments (sewage sludge and lime) affect bacterial community structure and soil processes, and how changes in structure relate to function.

## Experimental site and design
- Location: Rigg Foot experimental field site, Sourhope Research Station, Cheviot Hills, Southern Scotland; acidic brown forest soils.
- Design: randomised block with three replicates across four treatments: untreated control, lime-only, sewage sludge, sewage sludge after lime.
- Treatments and timing: lime at 600 g m^-2 over two years (1999–2000); sewage sludge applications (10 L m^-2 in Aug 1999 and 20 L m^-2 in May 2000).
- Sampling strategy: soil cores from all plots; 1999 sampled root and below-root zones; 2000 focused on root zone; sampling times corresponded to days after sludge application: 1, 3, 16, 30, 58 (May 30, 2000). Subsamples stored for chemical or molecular analyses.

## Measurements and analyses performed
- Soil characteristics measured: pH (1:2 soil-water), moisture, total carbon, total organic carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, soil NH3.
- Soil process measurements: basal respiration (CO2 accumulation) and autotrophic nitrification potential (NO2^- accumulation in chlorate-treated slurries).
- Molecular analyses: TTGE analysis of PCR-amplified bacterial 16S rDNA (eubacteria) and ammonia-oxidizer (AOB) fragments; DNA extraction from soil; analysis of banding patterns to infer community structure.
- Data processing: TTGE band intensities used to calculate Sorensen similarity coefficients; cluster analysis (UPGMA); two-factor ANOVA (time and treatment) on replicates; exploratory PCA not used due to experimental design.
- Related methodological notes: references covering methods for soil and water analyses, DNA co-extraction, and TTGE analyses.

- Dataset 1126: Numerical analysis of ammonia oxidizer community profiles (TTGE) for sludge-only treatment – TTGE data for sludge treatment across all times.
- Dataset 1127: Numerical analysis of ammonia oxidizer community profiles (TTGE) for untreated soil only – TTGE data for untreated soil across times.

## Data processing and quality control
- Verification included numeric range checks, formatting checks, and logical integrity checks.
- QA procedures but no warranty: data providers (NERC) state they cannot warrant accuracy or fitness for a specific use; data should be used with awareness of limitations.
