# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report (2002)

- Four years into the Sourhope field experiment, monitoring focuses on above-ground productivity, plant species composition, and diversity under five main site treatments plus control plots.
- Three management processes drive major botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and soil insecticide application; trampling in some plots also influences productivity.
- The study tracks how these treatments shift functional plant groups (stress-tolerators, competitive-stress-ruderals) and overall ecosystem structure, with extensive data from biomass harvests, point analyses, soil chemistry, and weather.

## Aim and context

- Objective: understand how above- and below-ground components interact under controlled management to inform predictions about ecosystem responses to management actions.
- Site background: Sourhope experimental site on a south-facing downslope; initial vegetation classified as Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland; grazing excluded from April 1998 onwards.
- Treatments: five plot-level treatments (Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime) plus Insecticide (formerly Biocide) as a sixth level; mowing at approximately 6 cm height; lime and nitrogen applied seasonally; insecticide applied after mowing.

## Methods (incorporating site activity)

- Experimental design: 5 replicate blocks; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells used by different research groups.
- Data collection: regular weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station; above-ground productivity via repeated 0.5 m2 harvests, dried and weighed; baseline vegetation survey; annual point analyses using 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid; bryophyte and liverwort identification added in 2002; soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture measured periodically; additional small-scale botanical surveys and biomass assessments.
- Timeframe: data collection and treatments implemented from 1998–2002, with major Phase I activity completed by 2002 and Phase II fieldwork involving multiple projects continuing.

## Results

### 3.1 Automatic weather station
- 2002 featured low rainfall in April and September, with wetter periods in February, July, and the last three months of the year; winter 2001/02 was unusually mild.
- Weather context influenced plant responses indirectly via moisture availability and stress periods.

### 3.2 Above-ground biomass estimates
- Biomass hierarchy across treatments persisted, but 2002 saw a general fall in AGB production in several treatments compared with 2001.
- Nitrogen and Lime (N&L) plots maintained the strongest productivity; fertilised plots (especially N+L) showed the greatest biomass gains relative to unfertilised controls over time.
- Control 2 plots consistently underperformed relative to Control 1 in 2002.
- A notable slope effect: blocks at the bottom of the slope (Block 1) showed larger percentage declines in biomass compared with upper blocks (Block 5).
- Yearly ANOVA showed significant treatment effects, significant year effects, and significant treatment-by-year interactions.
- Appendix data show long-term biomass increase across treatments since 1999, but 2002 reductions relative to 2001 varied by treatment (e.g., 13.7% in N&L to 31.2% in Control 2).

### 3.3 Interaction between soil pH, moisture, and above-ground productivity
- Lime addition produced a strong, significant rise in soil pH (near 7.0 in limed plots); nitrogen also increased pH but to a lesser extent.
- Soil moisture negatively correlated with pH (r ≈ -0.68), separating improved (higher pH) plots from wetter, unimproved plots.
- Positive overall correlation between higher soil pH and biomass across treatments; however, when analyzed within treatments, the pH–productivity relationship weakened or reversed in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime, indicating a more complex, non-linear response.
- The combined N+L treatment suggested greater use of the more benign growing environment, with shifts in functional group composition.

### 3.4 Point Analysis survey
- No significant difference between two surveyors in 2002 point counts; 2002 hits pattern similar to previous years.
- Fertilised plots (N and/or Lime) showed greater hits for Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, characterising more fertile conditions; unimproved plots remained dominated by Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.
- Bryophytes (notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increased across the site, making up about 20% of hits in 2002, especially in unimproved plots, and mosses contributed notably to biomass in several years.
- Litter hits increased in 2001 and 2002 in some plots, indicating changes in vegetation structure.
- Shannon Diversity Indices declined in the nitrogen-and-lime plots by 2002 relative to baseline, while other treatments showed increases (up to 29%), indicating treatment-specific effects on diversity.
- Functional group analysis (S = stress-tolerators; CSR = competitive-stress-ruderals; SR/CSR) revealed three dominant groups accounting for 69–95% of hits per plot; by 2002:
  - N+L plots: SR/CSR and C-S-R groups expanded, indicating more competitive and stress-ruderal species.
  - Unfertilised plots: stress-tolerant species expanded, reflecting lower disturbance and nutrient input.
  - Across years, differences among treatments for SR/CSR became statistically significant, illustrating shifts in ecological strategies under different management regimes.

## Discussion

### 4.1 Mowing effect
- Aggressive decline of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across nearly all treatments since 2000 suggests a site-level factor beyond individual treatments, possibly the uniform mowing regime versus prior heterogeneous grazing.
- Festuca rubra expanded particularly in more fertile (lime- and/or nitrogen-amended) plots.
- Widespread expansion of stress-tolerant species and mosses likely relates to reduced disturbance from grazing and regular mowing; moss expansion moderates in more fertile plots due to higher vascular plant productivity.

### 4.2 Fertilisation effect
- Long-standing positive effect of soil improvements (N and/or lime) on above-ground biomass, with the strongest productivity where both nitrogen and lime were applied.
- Potential downsides of high lime application: mean soil pH nearing 7.0 and possible moisture stress, leading to chlorosis under some summer conditions.
- The rise in pH favored C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderals) species, especially when lime was present; nitrogen alone yielded different responses, indicating lime-driven pH changes may be more influential than nitrogen in some contexts.
- Higher pH and altered moisture regimes may intensify drought stress in some plots, reducing productivity in drier periods.

### 4.3 Insecticide effect
- Insect herbivory interactions with plant communities are complex and varied; evidence suggests that suppression of herbivory may benefit a subset of palatable species in infertile conditions, potentially boosting diversity, but the data do not establish a direct, consistent causative link between insecticide use and Shannon diversity increases.
- Existing literature suggests that insect control can increase diversity initially but may depress it later in succession; in Sourhope, effects depend on the broader nutrient–disturbance context.

### 4.4 Trampling effect
- First-year sampling in C2 plots (which involved intense activity for 13CO2 pulses) likely caused a notable, temporary drop in productivity relative to C1 plots, indicating trampling as a confounding factor in short-term productivity measurements.

## Implications and takeaways for data-driven decisions

- Management actions have clear, measurable effects on productivity, species composition, and functional group structure; fertilisation (especially N+L) boosts biomass but changes community composition toward competitive-stress-ruderals and reduces diversity in some cases.
- Mowing without grazing shifts communities toward stress-tolerant and bryophyte-rich assemblages, with mosses becoming more prominent and certain grass species declining.
- Soil chemistry (pH) and moisture are key mediators of productivity; lime-driven pH increases can raise productivity but may also reduce moisture availability and alter plant functional groups.
- Insecticide effects are nuanced and context-dependent; any biodiversity gains from reducing herbivory should be weighed against broader nutrient and disturbance regimes.
- Spatial gradients (downslope position) influence productivity responses, with lower slope positions experiencing larger declines, highlighting the importance of site-scale heterogeneity in interpreting treatment effects.

## Key data-driven insights (summary)

- Fertilisation consistently increases above-ground biomass, especially when nitrogen and lime are both applied, but may push pH toward 7.0 and interact with moisture to influence productivity.
- Regular mowing promotes Festuca rubra and bryophyte expansion, while reducing Agrostis spp.; disturbance regime (grazing vs mowing) is a major determinant of species turnover.
- Point analysis shows a shift from unimproved to improved-field species under fertilisation, and bryophyte abundance rises across treatments, particularly in less fertile plots.
- Diversity declines are observed in some fertilised plots (notably N&L) by 2002, while other treatments show increased diversity; functional-group analyses reveal treatment-specific shifts (S, CSR, SR/CSR) consistent with nutrient and disturbance regimes.
- Trampling and field campaign logistics can significantly affect immediate productivity measurements and should be accounted for in interpretation.
