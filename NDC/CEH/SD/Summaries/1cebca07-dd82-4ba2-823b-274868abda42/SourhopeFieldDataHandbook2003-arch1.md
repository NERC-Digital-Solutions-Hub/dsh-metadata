# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

- The data excerpt provides detailed soil profiles and accompanying analyses for Block 4 and Block 5 at Rigg Foot, Sourhope, with additional ecotron plots and vegetation surveys.
- Focuses on horizon-by-horizon description, chemical properties, moisture and organic content, and plant community data to link soil characteristics with vegetation patterns.
- Site context and methods include horizon naming, depth ranges, texture, color, structure, root presence, and the distribution of stones; chemical analyses cover %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2); vegetation data capture species presence, abundance, and plot-level totals.
- Data are organized by block (4 and 5) with per-horizon profiles, augmented by auger-sample results and ecotron plots; vegetation surveys accompany soil data to enable soil–vegetation correlation analyses.
- Limitations noted include some missing data in certain horizons and partial sub-sample coverage in establishment year analyses; emphasis on block-wide patterns rather than single-plot outliers.

## DATA ACCESS, GAPS, AND USE

- The datasets provide baseline soil, vegetation, and management perturbation data suitable for exploring correlations and predictive relationships between soil properties and plant communities.
- Metadata and archiving support long-term discovery and reuse; data integrated with ECN and MLURI streams for broader environmental context.
- Caveats
  - Early establishment year sampling covered only a subset of subplots; results indicate indicative patterns rather than exhaustive site-wide coverage.
  - Some blocks exhibit anomalous values; analyses emphasize robust cross-block patterns over single outliers.
- Practical implications
  - The data enable evaluation of how soil properties (pH, Ca/Mg, C/N, LOI, texture) relate to floristic composition, and how management perturbations (e.g., lime, nitrogen, biocide) may influence soil–vegetation interactions in upland grassland systems.
