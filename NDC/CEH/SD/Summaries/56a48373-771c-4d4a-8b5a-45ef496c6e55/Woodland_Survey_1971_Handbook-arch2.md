# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

## Overview
- Standardized field methodology for national woodland classification focused on environmental condition, policy performance, and long‑term data comparability.
- Outputs include ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot descriptions, habitats, and soil data; datasets intended for storage on appropriate portals for scrutiny and reuse.

## Aims and Application
- Create consistent, auditable datasets to demonstrate environmental health over time.
- Enable monitoring organisations to verify data provenance, quality, and comparability across sites and years.
- Provide clear formats (forms, maps, charts) for communicating findings to stakeholders and policymakers.

## Organization and Data Flow
- Pre-survey planning: outline operations to minimize travel, account for access, and plan base locations; use multiple sites from a common base when efficient.
- Field equipment and forms provided; maps and recording sheets prepared; Appendix VI contains equipment checklists.
- Data handling emphasizes storing and uploading finished datasets to designated portals.

## Access and Permissions to Survey
- Advance information on sites indicates who is responsible for permission; follow regional guidance.
- If permission is refused or uncertain, use back‑up sites and coordinate with Merlewood/Regional Office.
- Good public relations are essential; explain the survey purpose clearly and reassure owners that surveying is not a purchase or compulsory action.

## Site Planning and Access
- Determine best access points to minimize walking distance while respecting property boundaries.
- Avoid traversing fences/fields unnecessarily; use marked tracks/footpaths where possible.
- If permission is granted, ask owners about any areas to avoid or precautions to take.

## Locating Sampling Points
- Sites mapped on the 22" map with 16 sampling points; accuracy and lack of subjective bias are priorities.
- A predetermined, mechanical locating method is used to achieve about a 20 m radius accuracy from true location.
- Method steps include selecting the next point, identifying a control point on the ground, bearing to the sample point (correcting for magnetic variation), pacing out distance, and returning to the ground control point to mark the sample point.
- Avoid bias by sticking to predetermined paces and fixed bearings; use consistent control points at similar slope heights.

## Order of Recording Data
- At each sampling point, collect four data sets plus two sample series:
  - (a) Ground flora presence/absence across five increasing quadrat sizes and percent cover/abundance estimates; collect a comprehensive bryophyte sample from the full plot.
  - (b) Trees (>5 cm DBH), saplings, and shrubs with species, diameter, and height data (diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3 for saplings and shrubs).
  - (c) Plot description and habitat attributes (presence/absence of defined features).
  - (d) Soil data from a central pit and auger borings; a composite 10–15 cm soil sample is taken.
- Ground flora is recorded first to minimize disturbance; subsequent data follow (trees, then soil), with flexibility in order for convenience.

## Ground Flora Quadrat Method
- Layout uses a centre point with a right‑angle gauge; four corner poles delineate nested plots from 2x2 m up to larger sizes (e.g., 14.14x14.14 m).
- At each quadrat size, record all vascular plant species (monocots, dicots, ferns) and collect bryophytes as a comprehensive sample (not for bryophyte counts within nested sizes).
- Label unidentified specimens for later verification; herbarium samples collected per Appendix I.
- For each plot, estimate total ground flora cover and abundance, including litter, wood, rock, water, bare ground, and bryophytes.
- A "Code No" column is reserved for office use to facilitate data punching.

## Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs
- Trees: record all stems >5 cm DBH within the entire 14.14x14.14 m plot; note live and dead status, with separate entries for multiple stems.
- Saplings: record species with DBH/height data for stems within diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3.
- Shrubs: record in the same quarters as saplings; follow the same measurement conventions.
- Height: measure the tallest tree in the plot using provided instruments (Haga or Blume‑Leiss hypsometer).

## Plot Description and Habitats
- Record attributes describing slope, aspect, disturbances, and habitat types using Appendix IV definitions.
- Include a ground profile sketch showing major features; provide a concise, coded description of habitat attributes.
- Use the site form to capture site‑level attributes and the plot form for plot‑level attributes; cross‑check for consistency between forms.

## Site Description and Habitats (Site‑level Form)
- Complete for each site, with 16 plots per site; includes management, regeneration, living/dead habitat categories, rocks, aquatic habitats, vegetation groupings, and human influences.
- Attributes are coded and organized to align with the plot form (codes differ between site and plot forms but describe the same concepts).

## Soil Data and Interpretation
- Due to scale (1648 plots), only a limited, core set of physical/chemical measurements is used:
  - pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay).
  - Sub‑samples retained for potential later analyses.
- Soil is described using a horizon-based interpretation with named horizons:
  - Ao (organic litter layer)
  - Al (leached/eluviated organic‑mineral layer)
  - A2 (leached mineral layer)
  - B1 (deposition layer) and B2 (weathered mineral layer)
  - C (underlying material)
- Practical horizon interpretation guides: presence/absence and degree of horizons, color, structure, moisture, texture, and mottling.
- Emphasis on creating a numerical description of soil profiles, enabling consistent comparisons across sites and time.
- Major woodland soil types discussed include podzolic soils (various subtypes) and calcareous soils (rendzina, base‑rich variants), with factors like rainfall, drainage, base status, parent rock, and vegetation influencing soil development.
- The soil horizon data are designed to support objective, reproducible analysis rather than heavy, full laboratory soils workups.

## Site and Plot Forms, Coding, and Consistency
- Two main form types: Site Description and Habitat Form (site level) and Plot Description and Habitat Form (plot level).
- Codes for attributes are sequential within each form; some attributes exist only on one form but can be treated together with cross‑referenced code sequences.
- Data validation emphasizes ensuring that present plot attributes are reflected on the site form; if a significant area is present, it must be captured on the site form.

## Herbarium Specimens
- Collect type specimens for all species observed; obtain flowering material when possible.
- Label specimens clearly with field names, codes, and the expected taxonomic name; prepare herbarium sheets for submission.
- Ensure consistency of naming across field sheets and herbarium vouchers; collect duplicates if uncertain and merge later if necessary.

## Equipment and Logistics
- Detailed list of field equipment, including center pole with right angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings, compasses, tapes, hypsometer, mattock, auger, bags, labels, map sheets, and standard office supplies.
- Field logistics emphasize careful packing, labeling, and secure transport of soil, bryophyte, and herbarium samples.
- Post‑survey packaging: samples are organized into boxes per site, with pre‑paid shipping labels for return or dispatch.

## Data Quality and Long‑Term Use
- Data are captured to support long‑term monitoring, enabling cross‑site and cross‑time analyses.
- The manual stresses thorough checks of forms, complete data capture, and high standards of identification to minimize misclassification.
- The approach aims to produce datasets that can be reused in future analyses and integrated into centralized environmental monitoring systems.
