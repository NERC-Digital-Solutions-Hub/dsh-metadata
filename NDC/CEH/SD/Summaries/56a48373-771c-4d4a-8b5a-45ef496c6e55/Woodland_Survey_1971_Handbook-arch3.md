# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - Standardized field protocol for surveying woodlands to classify environmental health, scrutinize policies, and inform future decisions.
  - Provides detailed procedures for planning surveys, collecting data on ground flora, trees, saplings, plot habitats, soils, and site descriptions, and for compiling and sharing results.

- Preparation, permissions, and access
  - Prepare a survey plan per site to minimize travel and accommodate access constraints; obtain permission from woodland owners where required.
  - Use tact and good public relations; explain aims clearly and offer backup sites if access is refused.
  - Maintain awareness of potential concerns (privacy, fences, game birds) and plan contingencies when access is restricted.

- Sampling framework and point locations
  - Sites are mapped from 22" Ordnance Survey maps; 16 sampling points are predefined on the site map.
  - Location accuracy target: within approximately 20 meters of the true point location.
  - Locate sampling points from a ground control point using a predicated, bias-minimizing method (bearing, distance with compass, pace counts, and slope correction where appropriate).
  - The procedure emphasizes unbiased selection and fixed, repeatable methods to ensure comparability across sites.

- Order of data collection
  - (a) Ground flora: record presence/absence across five progressively larger quadrats (2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m) and estimate percent cover for vascular plants; collect bryophytes comprehensively from the full plot.
  - (b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs: measure stems >5 cm DBH for trees; record saplings and shrubs in diagonally opposite quarters; capture species, diameter, and status (live/dead); record height of the largest tree.
  - (c) Plot description and habitats: document habitat attributes and plot-level conditions.
  - (d) Soil data: obtain a composite soil sample from the center of the plot and conduct basic analyses; collect small pits and auger cores for horizon description where feasible.
  - Data collection order aims to minimize disturbance to ground flora while ensuring comprehensive coverage of all data types.

- Plot layout and data collection details
  - Center point established; right-angle gauge oriented to randomize plot orientation; four corner posts connected by distance strings to delimit nested square plots: 2x2 m, 4x4 m, 7x7 m, and 14x14 m.
  - Ground flora: search and record all vascular plants within each quadrat size; specimen samples for herbarium collected as needed; bryophytes recorded comprehensively but not broken down by quadrat size.
  - Trees, saplings, shrubs: record trees >5 cm DBH; saplings and shrubs recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); special attention to multi-stemmed individuals and status of stumps.
  - Plot descriptors/habitats: record slope, aspect, and a range of habitat attributes; provide a site sketch and a ground profile along a maximum slope line.
  - Soil data: a small pit exposes 25–30 cm of profile; an auger probes deeper; collect a composite 10–15 cm soil sample; if soil sampling is difficult, note and attempt to supplement from nearby points within the plot.

- Site Description and Habitats
  - A comprehensive Site Description and Habitats form covers the entire site (the in-between-plot area included) to capture marginal land use, boundaries, and site-wide characteristics.
  - A Plot Description and Habitats form, a condensed version of the site form, records data for each 16 plots.
  - Data are organized with a coded system to facilitate data handling, with an emphasis on internal consistency and cross-form compatibility.

- Completion, packaging, and data transfer
  - After data collection, forms are checked for completeness and consistency; all samples and forms are packed into designated boxes.
  - Samples and herbarium specimens are labeled and shipped using pre-paid packaging; a systematic, durable cataloging approach is mandated to preserve data integrity.

- Herbarium collection and identification
  - Every site team leader must prepare and submit a herbarium collection to demonstrate identification accuracy.
  - Collect type specimens for all species observed; label with the correct name or field code and attach specimens to herbarium sheets securely.
  - If uncertain, collect a specimen for later verification; meticulous labeling helps reconcile field codes with scientific names.

- Soil data collection and interpretation
  - Rationale: extensive soil analyses are impractical for 1,648 plots; therefore, a limited set of physical/chemical measurements plus a detailed soil-profile description is used to characterize soils numerically.
  - Major soil types covered include Podzolic soils (acid, leached, freely drained), hydromorphic soils (gley, peat, bog), skeletal soils (shallow to bedrock), and calcareous soils (terra rossa, Rendzina, and lime-rich variants).
  - Soil interpretation emphasizes pedological processes (leaching, profile development, drainage, base status, vegetation history) and their implications for habitat and plant communities.
  - Profiling is horizon-based, with a standardized set of horizon descriptors (Ao/Aoo, Al, A2, B1/B2, C) including depth ranges, moisture, color, texture, structure, and evidence of deposition or weathering.
  - The form guides horizon identification, transition types, and interpretation notes, including gleying, humus type (Mull, Mor, Moder), and underlying materials.

- Horizon-based soil description method
  - Ao (organic surface) and Ao/A0 horizons: presence, decomposition, moisture, colour, and humus content.
  - A0/A1/A2 (organic-mineral mix): depth, colour, texture, moisture, and presence of eluviation.
  - B horizon (deposition and weathering): differentiation between B1 (deposition) and B2 (weathered mineral) with attributes for color, texture, structure, and moisture; deposition layers recorded when present.
  - C horizon (underlying material): parent material, depth, rock fragments, texture; often not fully accessible in deep soils.
  - Physical properties recorded include particle size distribution, density, soil moisture, and presence of roots, earthworms, and other biota.
  - Occasionally, where horizons are disturbed or atypical (ploughed, disturbed, recent alluvium), note such conditions and provide schematic horizon diagrams.

- Management and interpretation notes
  - The handbook provides guidance for distinguishing planted vs. natural woodland elements (e.g., planted hardwoods, planted conifers, coppice origin, pollards, stumps) to aid interpretation of historical management.
  - Habitat and boundary attributes are catalogued to support landscape-level analyses and to facilitate cross-site comparisons.

- Equipment and forms
  - Field equipment and forms are itemized (plot layout equipment, compasses, tapes, quadrat markers, herbarium materials, soil sampling tools, labels, etc.).
  - Detailed field forms (Site Description and Habitats; Plot Description and Habitats) with predefined attribute codes ensure standardized data capture and facilitate later data processing.
  - Appendices include instructions for collecting herbarium specimens, completing site and plot forms, and soil data collection and interpretation, along with example forms and checklists.

- Key takeaways for monitoring framework authors
  - Emphasizes standardized, repeatable data collection across sites to enable robust environmental health measurements.
  - Combines qualitative habitat descriptions with quantitative plots and horizon-based soil data to support analyses of ecosystem status and change.
  - Ensures data traceability through extensive labeling, specimen collection, and controlled recording formats that facilitate metadata creation and data sharing.
  - Addresses practical constraints (access, back-up sites, large sample size) with a structured workflow and explicit procedures to maintain data quality and comparability.
