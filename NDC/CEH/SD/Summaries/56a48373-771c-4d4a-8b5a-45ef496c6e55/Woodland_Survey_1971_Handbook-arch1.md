# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Aimed at standardising woodland surveys to classify woodland types, identify correlations, and support practical decision-making through quantitative data on ground flora, trees, habitats, and soils.
- Combines field surveys with herbarium work and soil description to enable robust data for analysis and modeling.

## Access, Planning, and Permissions

- Before surveying, prepare an outline plan to maximise efficiency and minimise travel, coordinating with Regional Staff and access permissions.
- Permissions to survey are sometimes pre-arranged; otherwise you may need to contact owners, farms, or occupants tactfully. If permission is refused, have back-up sites available.
- Public relations are important; clearly communicate the survey’s purpose (not a purchase bid) and address owner concerns.

## Site Selection and Access

- Sites identified on road maps and 22" site maps; obtain access with minimal disturbance to owners.
- Determine the best access points to minimise walking distance; avoid crossing fences or disturbing owners.
- If access is blocked, Merlewood can supply necessary information for back-up sites.

## Locating Sampling Points (Accuracy and Bias)

- Each site has 16 sampling points on a 22" map, to be located on the ground with an expected accuracy within a 20 m radius.
- Procedure to locate a ground sampling point:
  - Choose the next sampling point (not necessarily in numerical order).
  - Find a nearby accurate ground control point (intersection, wall, stream, or fence change).
  - Orient the map, take a bearing to the sample point, adjust for magnetic variation.
  - Measure ground distance with a ruler scale on the compass, then pace out the distance, with slope corrections if needed.
  - Ground-trace to the control point, then locate the exact sample point and avoid bias and drift.
- Predetermined paces and a fixed ground-trace method reduce subjective bias.

## Order of Recording Data

- For each sampling point, collect four data streams:
  - (a) Ground flora: presence/absence in five nested quadrats (2x2 m to 14x14 m) with % cover/abundance for the largest quadrat; comprehensive bryophyte collection from the full plot.
  - (b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs: diameters (DBH) of stems >5 cm; height of the tallest tree; saplings and shrubs limited to quarters 1 and 3; dead trees noted.
  - (c) Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of habitat attributes with detailed definitions (Appendix IV) and a ground-profile sketch.
  - (d) Soil data: small pit plus auger borings at plot center; composite top 10–15 cm soil sample; additional soil interpretation from horizons.
- The ground flora data should be recorded first to minimise disturbance; other data follow.

## Plot Layout and Recording

- Plot center marked with a center post; right-angle gauge set to random orientation; corner posts create the 2x2 m, 4x4 m, up to 14.14x14.14 m plots.
- Successive quadrats are expanded outward from the center, with markers indicating half-diagonals to delineate growing plot boundaries.
- For ground flora, record species present in each quadrat size; bryophytes documented as a full plot collection (not by quadrat).
- For vascular plants, record species and give cover/abundance estimates; specimen bags used for uncertain identifications.
- All data forms have codes (Site Code, Plot Code) for office data entry; “Office Use” codes (Code No) are used for species cataloging.

## Ground Flora: Quadrats and Sampling

- Quadrats progress from 2x2 m to 14.14x14.14 m; presence/absence of species in each size; bryophytes collected for a comprehensive vascular-plant-focused dataset.
- For each quadrat:
  - List all vascular plant species; record presence/absence; use standardized abbreviations or herbarium codes.
  - After finishing smaller quadrat, expand to the next size and record any new species.
  - Collect bryophyte specimens for a complete plot-level collection.
- At the full plot level, estimate cover and abundance for all vascular plants plus litter, wood, rock, water, bare ground, and bryophytes to total around 100% cover.

## Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs

- Record trees with stems >5 cm DBH across the full 14.14 m plot; separate saplings and shrubs; only diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) for saplings and shrubs.
- For each stem >5 cm DBH, record species and diameter; note dead trees with "D" marker.
- Measure the height of the largest live tree using provided height instruments; substitute with the next largest if the top is obstructed.
- An example of a completed form is provided in Appendix III.

## Plot Description and Habitats

- Record presence/absence of habitat attributes using a defined codebook (Appendix IV).
- Include slope (degrees) and aspect; use a baseline of 10 m to 20 m for slope measurements depending on the instrument (Haga or Blume-Leiss hypsometer).
- Provide a ground-profile sketch showing major features; entries include comments for interpretation.

## Site Description and Habitats (Site Form)

- A separate full description form records site-level attributes and habitats, including margins, boundaries, and in-between plot areas.
- The site form and plot form share linked attribute codes; ensure consistency and address any inconsistencies between forms.

## Soil Data Collection and Interpretation

- Collect a limited set of soil data due to scale (1648 plots planned):
  - Physical/chemical measurements: pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) on dried sub-samples.
  - Soil descriptions use horizon-based interpretation (A0, A1, A2, B1, B2, C) to describe pedological processes.
- Soil classification framework highlights major British woodland soil types:
  - Podzolic soils (acid, well-leached) with podzolisation; transition to hydromorphic or skeletal soils where drainage is impeded.
  - Brown earths and brown forest soils (less leached, more neutral to mildly acidic).
  - Calcareous soils on calcium-rich rocks (chalk/limestone), including Rendzina and other derived soils.
- The interpretation approach uses horizon-by-horizon descriptions (A0, A1, A2, B1, B2, C), texture (clay/silt/sand), color, structure, moisture, mottling, and horizon boundaries.
- Where horizons are poorly defined, use best approximations and document uncertainties; underlying material is recorded when possible.

## Soil Data Forms and Horizon Coding

- Separate forms for soil data and generalized descriptions; horizon-specific attributes include depth, color, texture, structure, moisture, and presence of organic material.
- When horizons are absent or unclear, mark as not applicable and provide notes on interpretation.
- The approach emphasizes a pragmatic, numerical description of soil profiles to support subsequent analysis.

## Completion, Packaging, and Data Handling

- After recording all data for a site (16 plots) and collecting both soil and bryophyte samples, verify completeness and consistency across site and plot forms.
- Staple all sheets, seal in the supplied polythene bags, and place in the provided cardboard boxes with proper labeling.
- Send parcels by post as soon as possible; ensure soil samples and bryophytes are properly labeled and separated as required.
- Maintain careful records of equipment and samples; ensure no items are left behind.

## Herbarium Collection (Appendix I)

- Collect a type specimen for all species observed; ensure proper morphological characters (preferably flowering material) and label specimens with standardized names/codes.
- Attach specimens to herbarium sheets with clear labeling; preserve samples for later verification and data accuracy.
- If uncertain, collect specimens and tag them for later verification; duplicate specimens can be merged with existing records if needed.

## Field Equipment and Logistics

- Detailed listing of required equipment for plotting, sampling, and specimen handling (e.g., center pole, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings, compression tape, compasses, pits, augers, trowels, herbarium supplies, labels, and packing materials).
- Ensure two haversacks (for clean and dirty gear) and a site bag for forms and samples.

## Practical Considerations for Analysts

- The methodology favours uniform data collection across sites, enabling robust cross-site comparisons and analyses.
- Acknowledges potential data gaps at local scales and the importance of reliable data provenance, metadata, and standardized recording.
- Emphasises the need for careful documentation of uncertainties (e.g., horizon boundaries, horizon presence/absence) to inform later analyses.

- Overall, this handbook provides a comprehensive, repeatable protocol for field data collection on woodland classification, balancing detailed ecological measurements with practical field constraints and data management.
