# Dataset Documentation Scottish Pinewoods Survey 1971 (Native Pinewood Survey)

- A detailed ecological survey of Scots Pine woodland habitats in Scotland, conducted in 1971 (with one extra wood surveyed in 1972). 
- Identified 27 major native pinewoods; 16 randomly selected 200 m² plots were surveyed in each wood (26 woods in 1971, 1 extra in 1972).
- Standardized procedures and coding systems were used to collect data on trees, ground flora, soil, and habitat, enabling comparisons and conservation planning.

## Geographical Coverage
- Surveyed 27 main native pinewoods across Scotland, including:
  - Glentanar
  - Black Wood of Rannoch
  - Ardgour
  - Ballochbuie
  - Mar
  - Abernethy
  - Rothiemurchus
  - Glenmore
  - Old Wood of Meggernie, Glen Lyon
  - Glen Moriston
  - Glengarry
  - Barrisdale
  - Glen Affric
  - Glen Cannich
  - Glen Strathfarrar
  - Guisachan and Cougie
  - Coulin
  - Shieldaig
  - Amat
  - Loch Maree
  - Black Mount
  - Glen Orchy
  - Tyndrum
  - Glen Feshie
  - Loch Arkaig and Glen Mallie
  - Achnashellach
- The Dulnan wood was also surveyed in 1972, located west of Abernethy and north of Glen Feshie.

## Overview of Datasets
- Vegetation Data: Trees, saplings & shrubs; vascular plants; bryophytes on the ground.
- Soil Data: Horizon depths, descriptions, and soil pH.
- Habitat Data: Habitat categories; slope and aspect; additional site descriptions.
- Data collection used a nested quadrat system within each 200 m² plot, with detailed field methods and standardized coding (Shaw and Bunce field methods).

## Survey Design & Methods
- Sample design: 27 major native pinewoods; 16 randomly assigned 200 m² plots per wood; overall structure follows Bunce & Shaw (1973) field methods and Bunce & Shaw (1971) handbook.
- Vegetation data collection:
  - Nested quadrats for vascular plants: 4 m², 25 m², 50 m², 100 m², 200 m²; all previously unfound species recorded as quadrat size increases.
  - Trees, saplings & shrubs recorded by individual within the plot; height, diameter at breast height (DBH), dead indicators, coppice structure, and stem grouping documented.
  - Bryophytes collected for later identification; percent cover estimated for species across the plot.
- Soil data collection:
  - Center pit to examine surface horizons; auger sampling for lower horizons.
  - Horizons classified using standard categories; top 10 cm sampled for pH analysis.
- Habitat data collection:
  - Habitat types classified using predefined categories; slope and aspect measured with clinometer and compass; additional site descriptions recorded.
- Data capture:
  - Site-level and plot-level data, including slope and aspect, are recorded on data sheets with standardized codes.

## Summary of Available Data per Site
- Data collection commenced mid-late July 1971 across multiple sites (approx. start dates listed per site).
- For each site, data commonly include site-level info, plot descriptions, soil data, tree data, and ground flora data; some sites include site descriptions or additional plots (Abernethy).
- One supplementary wood (Dulnan) surveyed in 1972.
