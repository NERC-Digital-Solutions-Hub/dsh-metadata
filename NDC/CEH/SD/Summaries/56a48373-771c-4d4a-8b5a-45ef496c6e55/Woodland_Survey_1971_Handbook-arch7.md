# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose: A comprehensive, standardized field manual for surveying woodlands to classify habitats and produce map-based data products. Covers site selection, plot layout, vegetation and soil sampling, and habitat description for GIS-ready datasets.

## Planning, Access and Permissions

- Obtain permission to survey each site; follow guidance from regional offices or Merlewood when required.
- Use common-sense, tactful communication with landowners to ease access concerns and explain that surveys are for conservation, not purchase.
- If access is refused, rely on backup sites and inform Merlewood to supply site information for alternatives.
- Plan efficient travel between sites, favoring bases from which multiple sites can be surveyed.

## Site and Point Localization

- Sites are mapped on 1" and 22" Ordnance Survey maps; aim to locate sampling points within about 20 m of true ground position.
- Use a control point, bearing from map plus magnetic variation, and a pace-based ground-tracing method to locate each sampling point.
- Do not compromise landowner convenience; use marked tracks/foothpaths, and minimize crossing fences or private boundaries.

## Sampling Framework (Plot Layout)

- For each site, 16 sampling plots are used (centered on a site layout grid). 
- Nested quadrats are laid out around a center point, starting with the smallest 2 m x 2 m plot and expanding outward through larger plots up to a final large plot (up to a maximum of 14 m x 14 m in the described layout; total area per plot reaches 200 m² for the full survey).
- The location and orientation of quadrats are fixed with center posts, corner poles, and distance strings to ensure reproducibility and minimize bias.

## Data Collection per Plot

- Four data sets are collected per site per plot, plus associated samples:
  - (a) Ground flora: presence/absence in five quadrat sizes (2x2 m up to 14x14 m), plus percent cover/abundance estimates for the largest plot; collect bryophytes comprehensively but record vascular plants in all quadrats.
  - (b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs: 
    - Trees >5 cm DBH: record species and diameter by quadrant; note dead trees with a “D”; measure the largest tree height.
    - Saplings (height >? and DBH up to 5 cm): recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) with similar data.
    - Shrubs recorded in same quarters as saplings with comparable metrics.
  - (c) Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of habitat attributes; detailed definitions provided in Appendix IV; include slope and aspect data, ground profile sketch, and a spatially-informed habitat context.
  - (d) Soil data: small central pit and auger borings to collect a composite top-soil sample (top 10–15 cm); additional samples can be taken if necessary. pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) are measured; samples retained for potential future analyses.

- Data recording order: ground flora first to minimize disturbance; then trees/saplings/shrubs; then soil description; plot description can be integrated as convenient.

## Site Description and Habitats (Whole Site)

- A separate Site Description and Habitats form is completed for each site, plus a Plot Description and Habitats form for context.
- Includes management and land-use attributes, bryophytes and epiphytes, rocks and habitats (cliffs, scree, rock piles, etc.), aquatic habitats, marginal land use, boundary types, human infrastructure, and a subjective overall impression.
- Marginal land use and boundary type fields help situate the site in broader landscape context.

## Soil Data: Interpretation and Major Woodland Soil Types

- Soil data are gathered using a limited, field-amenable set of measurements to support numerical analysis across many plots (1648 plots total).
- Key measurements: pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay), plus a horizon-based description (Ao, Ai, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) to capture pedogenic processes.
- Soil description is horizon-focused with a standardized form for each horizon (depth ranges, color, texture, structure, moisture, presence of organic matter, mottling, etc.).
- Two major soil groups emphasized:
  - Podzolic soils (freely leached, acidic, often with podzolization; include brown earths and brown podzols as related types).
  - Calcareous soils (free calcium carbonate; related to chalk/limestone geology; include Rendzina and related soils; spatially linked to rock type and drainage).
- The horizon interpretation guides how to distinguish A0/A1/A2, E2, B1/B2 horizons and transitions, with emphasis on horizons’ color, texture, structure, moisture, and presence of organic matter.
- Notes on dynamic soil development: most British woodland soils are immature or transitional; landscape and drainage mosaic drive soil variation.

## Herbarium Collection

- Field teams must collect a representative herbarium for verification of species records; obtain a type specimen for all species within quadrats when possible.
- Label specimens with precise species identity (field name vs. code) and ensure robust morphological characters (flowering shoots preferred) are present.
- Secure specimens on herbarium sheets and include as part of the site’s data package.

## Equipment and Field Logistics

- Field equipment and data handling are standardized and boxed for each site.
- Equipment lists cover quadrat layout tools (centre pole, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings), field sheets, sampling bags, labels, compasses, tapes, mattock and trowel, auger, hypsometer, and other measurement tools.
- Pre- and post-survey checklists ensure data and samples are complete, labeled, and securely packaged; samples are dispatched by post in designated boxes with pre-paid labels and retainers.

## Appendices and Forms

- Appendices provide:
  - Instructions for herbarium specimen collection (Appendix I) and examples of completed forms (Appendix II–V).
  - Detailed instructions for plot, site description, and soil forms (Appendix IV) and equipment checklists (Appendix VI).
  - Example completed data sheets illustrating how to fill in plot and site data.

## GIS Relevance and Data Utility

- The handbook yields spatially explicit, map-ready data:
  - Geolocated sample points with precise ground locations and bearings.
  - Hierarchical vegetation data from nested quadrats (presence, abundance, cover) suitable for layer creation.
  - Tree and sapling inventories with species distribution and size metrics by plot.
  - Plot-level habitat attributes and site descriptors that feed habitat-classification maps.
  - Soil type and horizon data that enable soil-tied habitat mapping and analysis.
- Standardized coding, forms, and data capture enable consistent data integration across sites for GIS analyses and national woodland classification outputs.
- Emphasizes data quality, reproducibility, and the need to test early prototypes and incorporate user feedback for better map-based products.
