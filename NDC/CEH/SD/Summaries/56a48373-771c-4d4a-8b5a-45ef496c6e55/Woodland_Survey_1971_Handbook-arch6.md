# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - A comprehensive field manual for surveying woodlands to classify and describe habitats, ground flora, trees, saplings, shrubs, soils, and site-level characteristics.
  - Supports data collection for national woodland classification projects and subsequent data analysis and interpretation.

- Preparation, permissions, and access
  - Prepare a plan outlining site visits to minimise travel and account for access restrictions.
  - Obtain site access permissions; follow sensible, tactful engagement with landowners and occupants.
  - If permission is refused, use backup sites and inform Merlewood; maintain good public relations to avoid negative repercussions.

- Data collection framework and workflow
  - Each survey site contains multiple plots (16 per site is typical in the method) and a site-wide description.
  - Data collection occurs in a defined order to protect data quality and minimize disturbance: ground flora first (to limit trampling effects), then trees/saplings/shrubs, then soil data, with plot habitat data captured as needed.
  - Precise, unbiased locating of sampling points is critical: use control points, orient maps with compasses, and pace out distances to within about 20 m accuracy. Predetermined, mechanical procedures minimize subjective bias.

- Plot layout and quadrats
  - Center-point based plot: start with a centre post and right-angle gauge; extend to four corner posts to define a 14.14 m square plot.
  - Nested quadrats for ground flora: 2x2 m (4 m2), 5x5 m (25 m2), 10x10 m (100 m2), and 14.14x14.14 m (200 m2); 2x2 m is searched first, then expanded outward to capture all vascular plants and bryophytes.
  - Ground flora data: presence/absence across quadrats, percent cover/abundance for the largest quadrat. Collect bryophyte samples as part of a comprehensive flora pool.

- Data collected per plot
  - Ground flora
    - Record presence/absence of all vascular plants in each quadrat size; estimate cover/abundance for the full plot; collect bryophytes from the plot (no bryophyte counts by quadrat size; one comprehensive bryophyte collection per plot).
    - Herbarium specimens for unidentified or rare species; label and store for later verification.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs
    - Trees: record all stems >5 cm DBH; measure DBH and species; note dead trees with “D” marking; measure height of the largest tree in the plot.
    - Saplings and shrubs: record in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); measure DBH for stems >5 cm and height thresholds as defined; use the same conventions for dead or multi-stemmed individuals.
  - Plot descriptor and habitats
    - Presence/absence of habitat attributes across the plot (as defined in Appendix IV); record slope, aspect, ground features, and create a ground profile sketch.
  - Soil data
    - Obtain a composite topsoil sample from the central area (top 10–15 cm) and collect a small pit with auger borings in the center for horizons A0, A1, A2, B1/B2, and C as applicable.
    - Record horizon descriptions, moisture, pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical (textural) analysis. Take additional sub-samples if needed to complete analyses.
    - Ensure soil data can be interpreted later; use pit walls and augers to determine horizon boundaries and depth (up to ~70 cm depth with auger limitations).

- Site-level data: Site Description and Habitats
  - Complete a dedicated site form describing the whole site and the between-plot habitats.
  - Document boundary types, marginal land use, and any large-scale habitat patterns that relate to the plots.
  - Use site-level data to interpret plot-level results and to provide a cohesive site narrative.

- Herbarium, specimen collection, and identification
  - Obtain type specimens for all species observed; collect flowering shoots when possible.
  - Record field identifications using codes, then verify with herbarium reference material.
  - Maintain uniform labeling and packaging; attach labels clearly to specimens; ensure specimens can be cross-referenced with field sheets.

- Soil data methodology and horizon interpretation
  - Use a simplified, standardized horizon scheme: Ao (organic litter), Al (organic-mineral mix), A2 (leached mineral), B1/B2 (weathered/deposition horizons), and C (underlying material).
  - Record horizon depth, colour, texture, structure, moisture, and presence of features such as gley, mottling, and iron/alum deposits.
  - Note transitional horizons and any deviations from typical profiles (disturbed, eroded, or immature soils).
  - When augering is insufficient to determine an horizon, document limitations and depths clearly.

- Data packaging, submission, and quality control
  - For each site: 4 data sheets per plot (ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot descriptors/habitats, soil data) plus two soil samples per plot; 16 plots per site.
  - Complete a separate Site Description and Habitats form for the site as a whole.
  - Staple and seal all sheets; place soils and bryophyte samples into labeled bags and boxes; ensure secure packaging (boxes no heavier than ~16 kg for mailing).
  - Use pre-paid, pre-addressed labels to dispatch parcels; back up datasets and ensure data are ready for punching into digital formats.

- Forms, codes, and data handling
  - Two principal forms: Site Description and Habitats; Plot Description and Habitats (reduced version of the site form with sequential attribute codes).
  - Attributes are numbered with explicit code series; cross-form consistency is important to enable integrated data handling.
  - Data validation steps include internal checks for completeness and logical consistency between site and plot forms; ensure all major attributes are captured for the site and plots.

- Equipment and logistics
  - Standard field equipment includes: plot marking gear (centre post, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings), compasses, tapes (30 m and 2 m), hypsometer or height instrument, mattock, trowel, auger, labels, bags, and field sheets.
  - Weighing and packaging considerations emphasize careful labeling and secure transport to avoid loss or mislabeling of samples.

- End-to-end emphasis for data-driven insights
  - The handbook is designed to produce standardized, self-consistent data products (e.g., habitat and vegetation summaries, soil profiles) that can be combined across sites for national woodland classification analyses.
  - Emphasizes accuracy and consistency over speed, with explicit guidance to avoid subjective biases in sampling and to document any deviations or difficulties encountered in the field.
