# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- A comprehensive guide to standardized woodland survey methods used to classify and document large numbers of field sites and plots.
- Covers data collection across ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot and site descriptions, soils, and habitat types; plus procedures for permissions, data quality, and sample handling.
- Intended to support consistent data governance, storage, sharing, and later discovery/use by researchers and managers.

## Purpose, scope, and data domains

- Establishes standardized field methods for surveying woods, including:
  - Ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs
  - Plot-level descriptions and habitats
  - Soil data and profile interpretation
  - Site-level description and habitats
  - Marginal land use and boundary types
  - Human/animal observations and management context
- Involves multiple forms and coded attributes to enable uniform data capture and subsequent data handling.
- Notes a large survey scale (e.g., 1648 plots) and the need for consistent metadata and documentation.

## Roles, responsibilities, and data governance

- Data collectors must obtain permission to survey each site and maintain good public relations with landowners.
- Use back-up sites if access is refused and document permissions and constraints.
- Emphasizes clear descriptions of survey purpose for owners; avoid implications of purchase or interference with ownership.
- Documentation and sample handling (herbarium, soil) are critical for data integrity and later verification.

## Permissions, access, and site logistics

- Access decisions may be pre-set or require contacting regional staff or landowners.
- When access is granted, determine the best entry points to minimize walking distance and avoid damaging property.
- Use common-sense, tact, and respect for owners’ concerns; if denied, switch to alternative sites.
- Maintain transparent communication about purposes and potential outcomes of the survey.

## Sampling design and point location

- Sites located using standard maps; 16 sampling points per site are marked on a 22" site map.
- Location accuracy target: within about 20 meters of true point.
- Steps for locating a ground point involve selecting a control point, orienting with map/compass, and pace-out procedures.
- Emphasizes avoiding subjective bias in point selection while maintaining practical accuracy.

## Data collection workflow and sequencing

- Four data sets are collected per point, plus soil samples (two sets per site).
- Recommended order: ground flora first (to minimize disturbance), then trees/saplings/shrubs, soil data, and finally plot/site descriptions.
- After data collection, check forms for completeness, label samples, and prepare for submission.

## Field equipment and forms

- Provides a detailed kit list for field data collection (survey layout, compasses, tapes, markers, herbarium supplies, soil augers, etc.).
- Key data are recorded on standardized forms:
  - Site Description and Habitats (site-level)
  - Plot Description and Habitats (plot-level)
  - Individual recording sheets for ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, and soil data
- Forms are designed for data punching and cross-referencing; “Code No.” fields are used for office-based data processing.

## Ground Flora: sampling design and recording

- Data collected in a systematic 2x2 m to 14x14 m set of nested quadrats (progressively larger plots).
- Record presence/absence for ground flora in all vascular plants (monocots/dicots/ferns) across quadrats; also collect bryophytes for a comprehensive herbarium sample.
- Randomized, unbiased search pattern by spiraling outward with two operators.
- Specimens kept in labeled bags; specimens used for herbarium verification; a separate code list (Appendix I) used for species IDs.
- After recording, an estimated percent cover/abundance is provided for all species within the full plot (14.14 x 14.14 m), with tallies scaled to 100%.

## Trees, saplings, and shrubs: measuring and recording

- Within the full 14.14 x 14.14 m plot:
  - Trees: stems >5 cm diameter; measure species and diameter at breast height; record per quarter; dead trees marked with "D".
  - Saplings: height < breast height; measured in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) with same data.
  - Shrubs: recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) with the same measurements.
- Height of the largest tree is measured using provided height instruments.
- An example completed form is provided (Appendix III).

## Plot description and habitats

- Attributes recorded as presence/absence on the plot: slope, aspect, and a detailed ground description.
- A separate habitat-form for the plot lists and defines various habitat variables with standardized codes (see Appendix IV for definitions).
- A sketch of the ground profile along the maximum slope line is required.
- Section-specific definitions ensure consistent interpretation of features like glades, clearings, streams, banks, and hollows.

## Soil data: collection, interpretation, and forms

- Soil data are collected from the plot center using a pit and auger to expose the upper 25–30 cm (plus a composite 10–15 cm sample).
- Key analytical variables:
  - pH
  - Loss on ignition
  - Mechanical analysis (% sand/silt/clay)
- Uses a standardized soil description approach with horizon-based interpretation (A0/Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) to support numerical data and comparisons.
- Horizons are described with depth (from-to), color, texture, structure, moisture, and other features (e.g., gleying, deposition).
- Provides robust guidance for distinguishing humus types (Mull, MODER, Mor) and podzolic processes, including how to handle incipient podzols and transitional profiles.
- If soil horizons are incomplete or uncertain, instructions for bracketed depth and notes are provided.
- Emphasizes that soils in Britain are dynamic and often immature; horizon interpretation is used to standardize data for analysis.

## Site and boundary descriptions

- Site Description and Habitats form captures the overall site context and boundary details.
- Boundary Type fields describe hedge, bank, ditch, fence, post-and-rail, wall, etc., with required minimum lengths and conditions for recording.
- Marginal land use sections document adjacent land uses within 400 meters, helping contextualize site-level influences.

## Data integrity, completion, and packaging

- After completing all site data (16 plots) and two soil datasets, teams must:
  - Check all forms for completeness and consistency (site/plot numbers, data entries)
  - Pack and label soil and bryophyte samples correctly
  - Prepare and seal parcels in pre-paid boxes for shipping
- A Site Description and Habitats form is completed per site; a Plot Description and Habitats form per plot; cross-checks ensure no omissions between site and plot data.

## Herbarium collection and species verification

- For each species encountered, obtain a type specimen when possible (ideally with flowering shoots).
- Label specimens with the corresponding field IDs; ensure consistent naming and cross-reference of codes.
- Emphasizes collecting duplicates for uncertain identifications to enable later reconciliation and data integrity.

## Additional notes and practical guidance

- Public relations and owner concerns are foregrounded; flexibility to use alternative sites is encouraged if access is refused.
- The workflow and code-based data capture are designed to enable downstream data punching, analysis, and cross-site comparability.
- The document provides practical examples and templates (appendices) for common data recording scenarios and soil profiles.
