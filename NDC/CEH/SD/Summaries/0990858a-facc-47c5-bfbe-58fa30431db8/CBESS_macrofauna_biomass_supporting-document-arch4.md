# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) macrofaunal biomass in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats.

## Overview
- Dataset on macrofaunal biomass (grams per square meter) across 6 sites over 2 locations (Essex and Morecambe Bay) and 2 habitats (mudflat and saltmarsh).
- Sampling occurred in winter and summer 2013, with 3 replicates across 22 quadrats at 4 spatial scales.
- Part of the CBESS field campaign; aims to support understanding of coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service sustainability.
- Staff responsible: Christina Wood and Martin Solan.

## Study design and scope
- Observations collected as part of the CBESS field campaign in winter and summer 2013; no planned repeat sampling.
- Data include species-level biomass and debris across multiple taxa and major groups.

## Location and habitats
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS).
- Coordinates:
  - Essex: AH 51.783N, 0.867E; FW 51.817N, 0.967E; TM 51.683N, 0.933E.
  - Morecambe Bay: CS 54.167N, 3.000W; WS 54.133N, 2.800W.
- Habitat contrasts:
  - Saltmarsh: two soil types (clay in Essex; sandy in Morecambe Bay), differing inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.
  - Mudflat: Essex with cohesive clays/mud/silt; Morecambe with coarser, more mobile sediments.

## Sampling and data collection
- Sampling units: 3 cylindrical cores per quadrat (10 cm depth, 10 cm diameter).
- Preservation: fixed in 4% buffered formalin in seawater; organisms preserved in 70% Industrial Methylated Spirit (IMS).
- Processing: species identified to species level (or major groups if damaged), stored in IMS; debris separated into major groups.
- Biomass measurement: individuals blotted to remove IMS, weighed to 0.0001 g; for very light specimens, a minimum weight of 0.0001 g recorded; biomass values scaled by a factor (127.323955) and rounded to 0.0001 g to yield biomass in g/m^2.
- Data checks: data entered by two people with double-check; biomass values cross-checked against CBESS_macrofauna_abundance.csv; species names validated against World Register of Marine Species (marinespecies.org).

## Taxa and measurements
- Variables include biomass for numerous taxa (e.g., Arenicola marina, Ampharete lindstroemi, Capitella sp., Hediste diversicolor, Macoma balthica, Mytilus edulis juveniles, etc.) and debris categories.
- Field descriptors include: row number, season (Winter W or Summer S), location (Morecambe M or Essex E), site codes, habitat (Mudflat MF or Saltmarsh SM), quadrat number (1–22), scale category (A–D), replicate (1–3), and measurement type (Macrofauna).

## Data processing and quality control
- Data input by two personnel with cross-checks.
- Biomass values validated against abundance data file to ensure consistency.
- Taxonomic names verified against authoritative sources (WoRMS).

## Data format and accessibility
- File format: CSV.
- Comprehensive field descriptions included to support interpretation and reuse.

## Stewardship and contacts
- Staff responsible: Christina Wood and Martin Solan.
- Dataset designed to support data discovery, standardization, and integration within broader coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service research efforts.
