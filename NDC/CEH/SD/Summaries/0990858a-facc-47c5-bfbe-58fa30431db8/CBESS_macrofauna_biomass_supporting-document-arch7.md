# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) macrofaunal biomass in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats.

## Overview
- A CBESS dataset documenting macrofaunal biomass (grams per m²) in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats.
- 6 sites across 2 locations (Essex and Morecambe Bay), sampled in winter and summer 2013.
- 3 replicates across 22 quadrats at 4 spatial scales.
- Staff: Christina Wood and Martin Solan.
- Site coordinates provided for Essex and Morecambe Bay locations; habitat and soil type contrasts noted.

## Content and structure
- Data recorded as biomass by species (and major groups/debris) per replicate and quadrat.
- File formats: CSV.
- Detailed dataset field descriptions available (e.g., Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Quadrat Number, Scale, Replicate, Measurement Type, individual taxa biomass, debris).

## Sampling and methods
- Field campaign: winter and summer 2013; no planned repeats.
- Sampling per quadrat: three cylindrical cores (10 cm depth, 10 cm diameter).
- Processing: cores fixed in 4% buffered formalin, than sieved (0.5 mm); organisms identified to species level or major group; debris separated as needed.
- Biomass measurement: individuals blotted, weighed to 0.0001 g; for light specimens, a minimum weight of 0.0001 g recorded.
- Biomass calculation: biomass per taxon per replicate converted to g m⁻² using a factor of 127.323955; values rounded to 0.0001 g.

## Location and habitats
- Locations: Essex (Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes) and Morecambe Bay (Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands).
- Habitats: Mudflat and Saltmarsh.
- Saltmarsh in Essex (clay soils) versus Morecambe Bay (sandy soils); Essex and Morecambe Bay saltmarsh regions differ in inundation frequency, creek structure, and vegetation.
- Mudflat sites differ in sediment type (Essex cohesive clays vs. Morecambe coarse sediments).

## Data quality and validation
- Data entry performed by two people; cross-checked against abundance data file.
- Species names validated against authoritative taxonomy (World Register of Marine Species).

## Data content details
- Taxa list includes multiple annelids, molluscs, crustaceans, nematodes, and major debris categories (e.g., Annelid debris, Mollusc debris, Crustacea debris).
- Dataset field descriptions specify: season, location, site, habitat, quadrat number, scale, replicate, measurement type, and per-taxon biomass or abundance values.
- Spatial scales range from 1 m up to 100 m and beyond (four hierarchical scales).

## Practical GIS considerations
- Well-suited for map-based analyses of spatial patterns in macrofaunal biomass across sites, habitats, and seasons.
- Requires integration with site coordinates and scale metadata to support choropleth or grid-based visualisations.
- Compatible with cross-referencing CBESS macrofauna abundance data for comprehensive spatial analyses.
