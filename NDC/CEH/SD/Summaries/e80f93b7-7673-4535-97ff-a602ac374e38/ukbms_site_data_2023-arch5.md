# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers contribute data, with data collection spanning since 1976 and current activity at over 3,000 actively recorded sites each year.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status to monitor changes and inform biodiversity policy questions. Data come from multiple sampling methods and are analyzed together to produce species-wide trends.

## Nature of data collected and sampling framework

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (typically 2–4 km), recording all butterflies within a fixed-width band (about 5 m) every week from April to September (up to 26 counts/year). Over time, more than 2,000 sites are monitored annually.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): similar transect methodology but in stratified-random 1 km squares; two parallel 1 km transects per site with 2–3 visits per year (plus encouraged spring visits), focusing on common habitats; around 800 squares sampled yearly.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) aimed at specific species during the main flight period.
- Data are aggregated across all methods to generate comprehensive abundance indices for species and sites.

## Data processing and trend analysis

- UKBMS uses abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts.
- Indices for a site are combined into species-level indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with a site-year weighting that reflects the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed at that site.
- The method uses all counts from a season (Pollard walks, reduced surveys, WCBS) to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate to account for gaps, with weighting favoring observed data over extrapolated data.

## Quality control

- Data collection uses standard field forms; data are entered online or via Transect Walker before being uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods). Regional transect coordinators validate data, and continuous season-long checks occur.
- A second layer of validation includes automated/manual procedures to catch records outside distribution ranges, outside flight periods, new site arrivals, anomalous abundances, or other inconsistencies. Corrections are made through queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders.
