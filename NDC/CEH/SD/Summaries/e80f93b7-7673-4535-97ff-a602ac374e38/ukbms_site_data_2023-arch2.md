# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), with thanks to volunteers who contribute data.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status from a wide-scale, site-based monitoring program to understand insect population changes and support biodiversity policy questions.
- Sampling framework:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year) from April to September.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species.
- Scale and scope: since 1976, over 3000 actively recorded sites each year; all sampling methods are analysed together.
- Data use: essential resource for understanding butterfly population changes and addressing biodiversity status and trends in policy contexts.

# Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- Data outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes; site indices represent a constant proportion of butterflies present, varying by species detectability.
- Index aggregation: Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weighting so that data from each site in each year are weighted by the proportion of the species flight period surveyed, emphasizing observed data over extrapolated data.
- Methodology: uses all counts across a season (Pollard walks, reduced surveys, WCBS) to model the seasonal pattern and extrapolate to account for gaps, producing species-level collated indices.

# Quality control

- Field recording on standard forms; data entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks: flag anomalous values (e.g., unusually high counts, species outside flight period).
- Regional validation: transect coordinators review records; ongoing checks throughout the season.
- Additional validation: automated/manual checks for out-of-range distributions, out-of-season records, first-time site records, atypical abundances, or large deviations from typical site patterns.
- Corrections: data queries and coordination with coordinators/recorders to edit the main UKBMS dataset as needed.
