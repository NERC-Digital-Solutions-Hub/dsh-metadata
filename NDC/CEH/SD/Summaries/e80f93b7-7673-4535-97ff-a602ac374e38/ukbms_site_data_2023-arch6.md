# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UKBMS is a collaborative, funded program by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. It relies on volunteer data and has tracked butterfly population changes across the UK since 1976, currently with over 3,000 active sites each year.
- Data are used to understand insect population trends and inform biodiversity policy questions.

## Nature of data collection

- Sampling framework includes:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes, 2–4 km, 5 m wide, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) from April to September.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (plus encouraged spring visits).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg and larval web counts, using transect or alternative methods.
- Data collected are counts of all butterfly species along transects, including both common and targeted species.

## Nature of data processing and trend analysis

- Indices are abundance indices (relative, not absolute population sizes) reflecting the proportion of butterflies observed.
- Overall species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with site-year weighting based on the proportion of the species flight period surveyed.
- The method leverages counts from all survey types to model seasonal count patterns and extrapolate to account for gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

## Quality control

- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS system or Transect Walker.
- Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., abnormally high counts, records outside flight period).
- Regional transect coordinators review data; subsequent automated and manual validations check for distribution range, flight period, first-time site records, and unusual abundances.
- Data edits are made after validation; record requirements and corrections are documented with coordinators or recorders.
