# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## What it is and who runs it
- A funded, volunteer-driven program to monitor butterfly populations across the UK.
- Coordinated by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Since 1976, with data from over 3,000 active sites annually.
- Combines data from multiple sampling methods to provide a comprehensive view of status and trends.

## How data are collected (sampling framework)
- Standard transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km counts, 5 m wide belt, 26 counts/year (weekly Apr–Sep), weather-appropriate conditions.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year (minimum 2 in July/Aug), ~800 squares/year.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
- All data across methods are analyzed together to derive population indicators.

## Nature of the data and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of individuals; detectability varies by species.
- Indices combined with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) and site-year weighting by flight period surveyed.
- Counts from all methods estimate seasonal patterns and fill gaps in observation to produce robust annual indices.

## Quality control and data integrity
- Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators review data; ongoing validation throughout the season.
- Further automated/manual validation checks for out-of-range distributions, first-time site records, or atypical data; corrections made through queries and coordinator/recorder input.
