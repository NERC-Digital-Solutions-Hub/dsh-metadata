# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. It relies on volunteers and aims to monitor butterfly population status to inform biodiversity policy and decision-making.

## Nature of data collected and sampling framework
- Data come from site-based monitoring using multiple sampling methods:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year) along fixed routes, across 2–4 km transects, typically in a 5 m wide band.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with 2–3 visits/year, targeting common habitats.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts, and other methods focused on specific species.
- The scheme covers the UK with over 3,000 active sites per year and has operated since 1976.
- All data from the various methods are analyzed together to generate population indices.

## Data processing and trend analysis
- UKBMS uses abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts.
- The Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) is used to combine site indices into species-level indices, with a weighting that accounts for the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site/year.
- Seasonal patterns are estimated across the season using all counts, and gaps are extrapolated, with greater weight given to observed data to improve accuracy.

## Quality control
- Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker, with automatic and manual validation.
- Regional transect coordinators validate records and check for anomalies (e.g., unusual counts, records outside known distribution or flight period).
- Data entry errors are corrected through queries and, when needed, discussion with coordinators or recorders before updating the main UKBMS dataset.
