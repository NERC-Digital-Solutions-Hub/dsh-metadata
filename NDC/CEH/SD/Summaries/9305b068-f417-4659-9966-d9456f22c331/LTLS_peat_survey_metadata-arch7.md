# Supporting documentation for the dataset Peat survey in England, Scotland and Wales carried out during 2014 [LTLS], Toberman et al.

## Overview
- Provides methodology and processing details for the LTLS peat survey dataset (2014) across five upland ombrotrophic blanket bogs in England, Scotland, and Wales; part of the Macronutrient Cycles project.
- Sites: Great Gnat's Head on Dartmoor (DM), Migneint (Mg) in northwest Wales, Moor House (MH) in northern England, Glensaugh (G) near NE Scottish coast, Forsinard Flows (F) in far north Scotland.
- Cores extend from 95 cm to 417 cm depth.
- Sampling aimed to represent latitudinal gradients and used two coring approaches to capture surface and deeper peat.

## Sampling details
- For each site, triplicate adjacent cores were collected using both a box corer (surface vegetation and uppermost 1 m) and a Russian-type corer (peat deeper than 1 m).
- All cores penetrated down to the underlying mineral substrate.

## Processing and preparation
- Cores were extruded, sliced at 10 cm intervals, air-dried for one week, sieved to 2 mm to remove large particles and roots, oven-dried at 60°C, and ball-milled to a fine powder.
- Bulk densities calculated as dry matter mass divided by the original wet volume.

## Measurements and analyses
- Phosphorus (P): measured colorimetrically after digestion in H2SO4/H2O2 (Seal Analytical AQ2).
- Carbon (C) and Nitrogen (N): measured on air-dried samples using an ISO17025-accredited method with an Elementar Vario-EL analyser.
- Radiocarbon (14C): sub-samples (15 in total: upper, mid-profile, and base) from the five LTLS sites sent to the NERC Radiocarbon Facility for AMS dating; CO2 from combustion isolated cryogenically, graphitised, and measured at SUERC AMS.
- Stable carbon isotopes (δ13C): measured on sub-samples using a Thermo Fisher Delta V to normalise 14C data to VPDB.
- Data presentation: 14C ages reported as conventional radiocarbon ages and absolute % modern, adjusted for radioactive decay since CE 1950.

## Depths and calibration
- 14C measurements are assigned to mid-point depths with a vertical error of ±5 cm.
- Calibration of 14C ages uses the IntCal13 curve.

## Data quality and standards
- Use of ISO17025-accredited methods for C and N analyses.
- Analyses conducted at accredited facilities (NERC Radiocarbon Facility; SUERC AMS) to ensure traceability and quality.

## GIS relevance and potential applications
- Produces depth-resolved chemical and radiocarbon information across five sites, enabling spatial comparisons and reconstruction of accumulation rates.
- Provides 10 cm sampling resolution data with explicit depth uncertainties, suitable for integration with GIS layers and regional analyses of peat carbon dynamics.
