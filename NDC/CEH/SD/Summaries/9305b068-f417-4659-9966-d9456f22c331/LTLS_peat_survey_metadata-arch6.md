# Supporting documentation for the dataset Peat survey in England, Scotland and Wales carried out during 2014 [LTLS], Toberman et al.

## Overview
- Dataset from a 2014 peat survey across five upland ombrotrophic blanket bogs in England, Scotland, and Wales, as part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles LTLS project.
- Aims to analyze long-term interactions of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in UK land, freshwater, and atmosphere; data intended to support data discovery, integration, and exploration.

## Sampling design and sites
- Sites (latitudinal gradient): Great Gnat's Head (Dartmoor, DM), Migneint (Mg, NW Wales), Moor House (MH, northern England), Glensaugh (G, NE Scottish coast), Forsinard Flows (F, far north Scotland).
- Five sites sampled with cores extending from surface to mineral substrate (95 cm to 417 cm depths).
- Cores collected as triplicate adjacent samples using a box corer (surface vegetation and upper 1 m) and a Russian-type corer (deeper peat).

## Sample processing
- Cores extruded, sliced at 10 cm intervals.
- Processing: air-dried 1 week, sieved to 2 mm to remove large particles/roots, oven-dried at 60°C, and ball-milled to a fine powder.
- Bulk densities calculated prior to milling (dry matter mass divided by original wet volume).

## Analytical methods and data types
- Phosphorus content: measured colorimetrically after digestion in H2SO4/H2O2.
- Carbon and nitrogen: measured with Elementar Vario-EL analyzer following ISO17025-accredited methods.
- Radiocarbon dating: sub-samples (n=15) from upper 20–30 cm, mid-profile, and base of one core per site sent to NERC Radiocarbon Facility for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating.
  - CO2 produced by combustion and graphitised for AMS analysis (SUERC facility in Scotland).
  - Radiocarbon results reported as conventional ages (calibrated to CE 1950) and absolute % modern, adjusted for ongoing decay since 1950.
  - Sub-sample CO2 stable isotope ratios measured with a dual-inlet mass spectrometer to normalize 14C data to -25‰ VPDB.
- Depth and uncertainty: all 14C measurements assigned to mid-depth with a vertical error of ±5 cm; used to estimate down-core accumulation-rate patterns.
- Calibration: 14C ages calibrated using the IntCal13 curve.
