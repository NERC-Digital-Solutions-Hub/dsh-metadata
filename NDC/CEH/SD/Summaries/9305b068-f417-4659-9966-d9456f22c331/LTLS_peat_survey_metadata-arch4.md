# Supporting documentation for the dataset Peat survey in England, Scotland and Wales carried out during 2014 [LTLS], Toberman et al.

- Objective and context
  - Document describes the dataset from a peat survey conducted in 2014 as part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles LTLS project (Analysing and simulating long-term and large-scale interactions of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in UK land, freshwater, and atmosphere).
  - Aims to collect and analyze peat core properties, carbon and nitrogen content, phosphorus content, and radiocarbon ages to inform down-core accumulation rates.

- Sampling design and sites
  - Five upland ombrotrophic blanket bogs chosen to represent a latitudinal gradient across Britain.
  - Sites: Great Gnat’s Head (DM, Dartmoor), Migneint (Mg, NW Wales), Moor House (MH, northern England), Glensaugh (G, NE Scottish coast), Forsinard Flows (F, far north Scotland).
  - Cores extended from surface to underlying mineral substrate, lengths 95 cm to 417 cm.
  - Triplicate adjacent cores collected in 2014 using box corer (surface vegetation and upper ~1 m peat) and Russian-type corer (deeper peat).

- Laboratory processing and measurements
  - Cores extruded, sliced at 10 cm intervals; air-dried ~1 week; sieved to 2 mm; oven-dried at 60°C; ball-milled to a fine powder.
  - Bulk densities calculated from dry matter mass and original wet volume.
  - Phosphorus content measured colorimetrically after digestion in H2SO4/H2O2.
  - Carbon and nitrogen determined on a Vario-EL analyser using ISO17025 accredited methods.
  - Sub-samples (20–30 cm upper section, mid-profile, and base from one core per site; total n = 15) submitted to NERC Radiocarbon Facility for AMS 14C dating.
  - CO2 derived from combustion of sieved soil, cryogenically separated, graphitised, and measured with SUERC AMS.
  - Stable carbon isotope ratios measured to normalise 14C data (VPDB -25 ‰ reference).
  - Data reported as conventional radiocarbon ages relative to CE 1950 and absolute % modern.

- Radiocarbon dating and calibration
  - 14C measurements provide mid-point depth with vertical error of ±5 cm.
  - Calibration of 14C ages performed using the IntCal13 curve.
  - 14C measurements used to estimate down-core accumulation patterns.

- Data quality, provenance, and standards
  - Laboratories involved: NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride) and SUERC AMS.
  - Carbon and nitrogen analyses conducted under ISO17025-accredited methods.
  - Detailed procedural steps enable traceability from field sampling to calibrated radiocarbon ages and accumulation rate estimates.

- Considerations for use
  - Limited number of sites (five) and a subset of cores used for AMS dating (n = 15) may constrain generalization.
  - Depth coverage and core lengths vary by site; homogenization steps (milling, sieving) standardized but may influence bulk density and concentration measures.
  - Metadata implied include site identifiers, core depths, measurement results, and calibration outputs, enabling integration with related LTLS datasets.
