# Supporting documentation for the dataset Peat survey in England, Scotland and Wales carried out during 2014 [LTLS], Toberman et al.

## Purpose and context
- Describes the sampling and analytical methods for the peat survey dataset collected in 2014 as part of the LTLS Macronutrient Cycles project.
- Aims to support long-term understanding of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus interactions in UK land, freshwater, and atmosphere.

## Sampling design and sites
- Five upland ombrotrophic blanket bogs representing a latitudinal gradient:
  - Great Gnat's Head, Dartmoor (DM)
  - Migneint, northwest Wales (Mg)
  - Moor House, northern England (MH)
  - Glensaugh, near northeastern Scottish coast (G)
  - Forsinard Flows, far northern Scotland (F)
- Cores collected triplicate and adjacent:
  - Box corer used for surface vegetation and uppermost 1 m of peat
  - Russian-type corer used for peat deeper than 1 m
- Core lengths ranged from 95 cm (Glensaugh) to 417 cm (Forsinard)

## Field and laboratory processing
- Cores extruded, sliced at 10 cm intervals
- Samples air-dried for one week, sieved to 2 mm to remove large particles and roots
- Samples oven-dried at 60°C to remove residual moisture
- Sub-samples ball-milled to a fine, homogeneous powder
- Bulk densities calculated as dry matter mass divided by original wet volume

## Measurements and analyses
- Phosphorus content measured colorimetrically after digestion in sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2SO4/H2O2) using a Seal Analytical AQ2 analyser
- Carbon and nitrogen contents determined on an Elementar Vario-ELanalyser using ISO17025 accredited methods

## Radiocarbon dating and isotope analyses
- Ball-milled sub-samples from upper 20–30 cm, mid-profile, and base of one core per site (n = 15) sent to NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride) for AMS 14C dating
- CO2 released by combustion in an oxygen-filled bomb, cryogenically separated, graphitized, and analyzed by SUERC AMS
- Stable carbon isotope ratios measured on CO2 (dual-inlet mass spectrometry, Thermo Fisher Delta V) to normalize 14C data to -25 ‰ VPDB
- Results reported as conventional radiocarbon ages (relative to CE 1950) and absolute % modern, adjusted for decay since CE 1950
- Mid-point depth and vertical error of ±5 cm assigned to all 14C measurements
- Calibration of 14C ages performed using IntCal13 curve

## Data outputs and interpretation
- Outputs include:
  - 14C ages (calibrated via IntCal13) and % modern values
  - Depth-specific information across five sites to enable down-core accumulation-rate assessments
  - Elemental data for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from the peat samples
- Methodology supports cross-site comparability and long-term environmental interpretations within the LTLS framework
