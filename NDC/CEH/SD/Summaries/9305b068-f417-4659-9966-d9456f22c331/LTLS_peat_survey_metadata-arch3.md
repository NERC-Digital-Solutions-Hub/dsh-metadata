# Supporting documentation for the dataset Peat survey in England, Scotland and Wales carried out during 2014 [LTLS], Toberman et al.

## Purpose and context
- Documentation of a peat survey conducted in five upland ombrotrophic bogs across Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) in 2014, as part of the NERC LTLS Macronutrient Cycles project.
- Aims to support understanding of long-term and large-scale interactions of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in UK land, freshwater, and atmosphere, informing monitoring and future decision-making.

## Sampling design and sites
- Sites representing a latitudinal gradient: Great Gnat's Head (Dartmoor, DM); Migneint (Mg, NW Wales); Moor House (MH, northern England); Glensaugh (G, NE Scotland coast); Forsinard Flows (F, far north Scotland).
- Five upland bogs; cores extended to underlying mineral substrate (depths 95 cm to 417 cm across sites).
- Sampling used duplicate/core techniques: box corer for surface vegetation and uppermost 1 m; Russian-type corer for deeper peat.
- Cores collected as triplicate adjacent samples at each site.

## Sample processing and measurements
- Cores extruded, sliced at 10 cm intervals, air-dried 1 week, sieved to 2 mm, oven-dried at 60°C, and ball-milled to a fine powder.
- Bulk densities calculated prior to milling.
- Phosphorus content measured colorimetrically after digestion in H2SO4/H2O2 using Seal Analytical AQ2.
- Carbon and nitrogen determined on ball-milled sub-samples after drying at 105°C using ISO17025-accredited methods (Elementar Vario-EL).
- Sub-samples from upper (20–30 cm), mid-profile, and base of one core per site (n = 15) sent to NERC Radiocarbon Facility for AMS 14C dating.
- 14C preparation: combustion of soil to CO2, cryogenic separation, graphitisation by iron–zinc reduction, AMS analysis at SUERC.
- Stable carbon isotopes measured on CO2 using Thermo Fisher Delta V to normalize 14C data to VPDB, with a reference of -25 ‰.
- All 14C results reported as conventional radiocarbon ages and absolute percent modern, adjusted for decay since CE 1950.

## Data treatment and calibration
- Measurements assigned to mid-point depths with vertical error ±5 cm.
- Calibration of 14C ages performed using the IntCal13 curve.

## Data applicability for monitoring
- Provides a detailed, calibrated dataset to estimate down-core accumulation rates and assess long-term changes in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus dynamics across Britain.
- Supports environmental monitoring and informs interpretation of nutrient cycling over time in UK peatland ecosystems.

## Quality assurance and data governance
- Use of ISO17025-accredited methods and reputable facilities (NERC Radiocarbon Facility, SUERC) for analytical steps.
- Standardised sampling intervals (10 cm), depth reporting, and calibration procedures to ensure data reliability and comparability.
- While data sharing governance is not explicitly stated, methodologies emphasize rigorous QA and traceability from field sampling to laboratory analyses.
