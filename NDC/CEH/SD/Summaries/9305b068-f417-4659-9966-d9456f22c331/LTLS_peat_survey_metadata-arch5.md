Supporting documentation for the dataset Peat survey in England, Scotland and Wales carried out during 2014 [LTLS], Toberman et al.

## Overview
- Documentation of a peat survey conducted in 2014 across five upland bogs in Britain as part of LTLS (Long-term and Large-scale Interactions of Carbon Nitrogen and Phosphorus in UK land, freshwater and atmosphere).
- Aimed at producing a well-documented, reusable dataset with detailed methodologies, measurements, and calibration information to support data discovery and reuse.

## Sampling and location details
- Five sites representing a latitudinal gradient:
  - Great Gnat's Head, Dartmoor (DM)
  - Migneint, Northwest Wales (Mg)
  - Moor House, Northern England (MH)
  - Glensaugh, NE Scottish coast (G)
  - Forsinard Flows, northern Scotland (F)
- Cores collected in 2014 from upland ombrotrophic blanket bogs.
- Core types:
  - Box corer for surface vegetation and uppermost 1 m of peat
  - Russian-type corer for peat deeper than 1 m
- Core lengths ranged from 95 cm to 417 cm; triplicate adjacent cores collected per site.
- Cores extruded, sliced at 10 cm intervals, air-dried for 1 week, sieved to 2 mm, oven-dried at 60°C, and ball-milled to fine powder.
- Bulk densities calculated from dry mass and original wet volume.

## Measurements and analyses
- Phosphorus content:
  - Measured colorimetrically after digestion in H2SO4/H2O2 using a Seal Analytical AQ2 analyser.
- Carbon and nitrogen content:
  - Measured on ball-milled samples with an Elementar Vario-EL analyser (ISO17025 accredited method).
- Radiocarbon dating and isotopes:
  - Sub-samples from upper (20–30 cm), mid-profile, and base of one core per site (n = 15) sent to NERC Radiocarbon Facility for AMS 14C dating.
  - Sample preparation: CO2 from combustion in an O2-filled bomb, cryogenic separation, graphitization via iron-zinc reduction, AMS analysis at SUERC (5 MV).
  - Stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) measured on CO2 sub-samples using a dual-inlet mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Delta V) for normalization.
  - 14C data normalized to -25 ‰ VPDB for δ13C corrections.
- Data reporting:
  - 14C measurements provided as conventional radiocarbon ages (relative to CE 1950) and absolute % modern, adjusted for ongoing radioactive decay since CE 1950.
  - Mid-point depth associated with each 14C measurement, with vertical depth error of ±5 cm.
  - Calibration of 14C ages performed using the IntCal13 curve.

## Data processing and quality assurance
- Sequence of processing steps applied consistently across samples:
  - Drying, sieving, and milling to produce homogeneous peat powder.
  - Removal of large particles and roots prior to analysis.
  - Calculation of bulk densities prior to milling.
- QA and provenance considerations:
  - Use of ISO17025-accredited methods for C and N analyses.
  - Standardized calibration (IntCal13) for 14C ages.
  - Clear documentation of depth intervals and associated errors to enable robust accumulation-rate analyses.

## Data provenance, metadata, and accessibility
- Comprehensive methodological metadata included to enable reproducibility and reuse:
  - Site identifiers, core collection methods, depth intervals (10 cm), and processing steps.
  - Instrumentation and analytical methods for P, C, N, and 14C/δ13C analyses.
  - Calibration curves and normalization protocols.
- Data products described include labeled depth horizons, chemical composition, and radiometric ages with uncertainties.

## Limitations and considerations for reuse
- Subset for AMS dating (n = 15 across five sites) may limit high-resolution age-depth modeling in some cores.
- Metadata on exact geographic coordinates, sampling dates (beyond year 2014), and site-specific environmental conditions are not detailed in the excerpt.
- Some legacy processing steps (e.g., bespoke milling and preparation) may require careful harmonization if integrating with other datasets.

## Implications for Data Stewardship
- Clear, standards-aligned documentation supports discoverability, interoperability, and reuse of the LTLS peat dataset.
- Key governance actions:
  - Ensure full metadata capture for all samples (coordinates, dates, depths, processing steps, units, uncertainties).
  - Maintain versioned data records including raw measurements, processed data, and calibration details.
  - Preserve chain-of-custody and instrument settings to support reproducibility.
  - Provide data access routes and licensing that enable downstream researchers to discover and reuse the data.
