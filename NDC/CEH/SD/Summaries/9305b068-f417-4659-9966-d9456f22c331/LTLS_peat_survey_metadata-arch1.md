# Supporting documentation for the dataset Peat survey in England, Scotland and Wales carried out during 2014 [LTLS], Toberman et al.

## Overview
- Part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project LTLS: Analysing and simulating long-term and large-scale interactions of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in UK land, freshwater, and atmosphere.
- Provides results from peat surveys at five upland ombrotrophic bogs across Britain, collected in 2014.

## Sampling sites and design
- Sites represent a latitudinal gradient:
  - Great Gnat's Head (Dartmoor, DM)
  - Migneint (Mg, NW Wales)
  - Moor House (MH, northern England)
  - Glensaugh (G, NE Scottish coast)
  - Forsinard Flows (F, far north mainland Scotland)
- Cores collected in triplicate adjacent samples per site.
- Sampling methods:
  - Box corer to recover surface vegetation and uppermost 1 m of peat.
  - Russian-type corer for peat depths >1 m.
- Core depths range from 95 cm (Glensaugh) to 417 cm (Forsinard), extending to the mineral substrate.

## Sampling and processing
- Cores extruded carefully and sliced at 10 cm intervals.
- Samples air-dried for ~1 week, manually sieved to 2 mm to remove large particles and roots, oven-dried at 60°C to remove residual moisture.
- Samples ball-milled to a fine, homogeneous powder.
- Bulk densities calculated as dry matter mass divided by original wet material volume.

## Laboratory analyses
- Phosphorus: measured colorimetrically after digestion in H2SO4/H2O2 using a Seal Analytical AQ2 discrete analyser.
- Carbon and nitrogen: determined on air-dried samples using an Elementar Vario-EL analyser following ISO17025-accredited methods.

## Radiocarbon dating and stable isotopes
- Sub-samples from upper 20–30 cm, mid-profile, and base of one core per site (n = 15) submitted to the NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride) for AMS 14C dating.
- CO2 from combustion in an O2-filled high-pressure bomb; separated cryogenically; graphitised by iron–zinc reduction; analysed with SUERC 5MV AMS.
- Stable carbon isotope ratios measured on CO2 to normalize 14C data to -25 ‰ VPDB.
- Data presentation:
  - Conventional radiocarbon ages (relative to CE 1950) and absolute % modern, adjusted for ongoing decay since CE 1950.
  - 14C measurements given as mid-point depth with vertical error ±5 cm.
  - Calibration of 14C ages performed using the IntCal13 curve.

## Data interpretation and usage
- 14C measurements used to estimate down-core accumulation-rate patterns.
- Results provide age-depth context for peat profiles and support analysis of long-term carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus dynamics.
