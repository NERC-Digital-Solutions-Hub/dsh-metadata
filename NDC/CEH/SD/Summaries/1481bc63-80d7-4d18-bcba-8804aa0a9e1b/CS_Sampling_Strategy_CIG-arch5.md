# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- The document documents the sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007 and explains the evolution of the ITE Land Classification that underpins the sampling framework.
- It tracks 30 years of methodological development, showing how stratified, random sampling and environmental land classifications are used to generate national and country-specific habitat estimates.

## Core Concepts for Data Stewardship
- ITE Land Classification as the backbone: a stratified framework built from environmental attributes to partition Great Britain into land classes for sampling.
- Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage and minimize bias.
- Time-series continuity: early classifications informed later surveys; revisions were necessary for policy needs and country-specific reporting.
- Data provenance and versioning: multiple generations of land classifications (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007) with transitional maps and crosswalks between classifications.

## Evolution of the Land Classification and Sampling Framework

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - Use of Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to create 32 land classes from environmental attributes for 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1228 classified; plus surrounding squares).
  - Sampling: 8 squares per class (256 total) surveyed in 1977–1978.
  - Output: national habitat area estimates based on class proportions and square-level means.

- 1984 – Second GB Land Use Survey
  - Same framework with expanded sampling: 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - Nationwide estimates still anchored to the 1978 Land Classification.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey
  - Land Classification revised to classify all 1 km squares in GB; urban and sea corrections added.
  - Survey: 508 squares; repeated vegetation quadrats; inclusion of Land Cover Map linkage.
  - Results published as Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- Early 1990s – Developments to Support Regional and Policy Needs
  - Realization that GB-wide classification needed to be extended to classify every square; 62% correspondence between old and new classifications, with most misclassifications falling into neighboring classes.
  - Implications: altered class representations required adjustments to ensure regional estimates remained robust.

- 2000 – CS2000: Separate Country Estimates & Expanded Coverage
  - Recognized need for England/Wales and Scotland-focused estimates; introduced country-unit sub-division of Land Classes, with aggregation where necessary (creating 40 strata from 32).
  - Added 19 new squares to improve representation in new classes; additional upland habitat sampling module (30 extra squares) to boost upland estimate precision in England and Wales.
  - Wales-specific considerations: Welsh representation intensified (new Welsh sub-classes in CS2000).

- 2007 – CS2007: Wales-Only Reporting and Welsh Class Sub-Divisions
  - Wales required dedicated reporting for policy/legislation, prompting sub-division into country-unit classes (5 new Wales-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an expanded total of 45 strata.
  - Wales saw 43 extra squares to ensure six samples per Welsh class; England did not receive more Welsh squares, resulting in some English classes with only four squares.
  - Result: revised England, Wales, and Scotland Land Class maps and sampling framework to support Wales-only reporting.

## Country and Sampling Details (Governance Perspective)
- England, Wales, Scotland share of GB land area and sampling rates varied by class and year; total GB sample counts increased from 569 (2000) to 591 (2007).
- Isle of Man data removed from country-unit estimates after 2000; replaced by new England squares to maintain country-unit representation.
- Tables and figures (Chapter references) document class-by-class sample distributions and changes across CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
- Summary of scale:
  - GB total squares surveyed across decades: over 230k GB squares in the 1990 framework; CS2000 and CS2007 expand the per-country sample allocation within 40–45 land classes.
  - Systematic documentation of sampling rates (1:x) per class and per survey to enable comparability and reweighting.

## Uplands Module and Targeted Sampling
- CS2000 introduced an uplands module (30 extra squares) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas, addressing under-sampling in higher elevation zones.
- CS2007 continued Wales-focused enhancements and country-specific sub-classifications to meet devolved governance needs.

## Data Governance Implications for Data Stewards
- Classification versioning: maintain and document which Land Classification version was used for each survey and how reclassifications affect time-series comparability.
- Cross-country reporting: ensure clear mapping of class definitions when aggregating England, Wales, and Scotland estimates; manage class sub-divisions and rump aggregations for country-specific reporting.
- Data lineage and metadata: capture the rationale for adding squares, sub-dividing classes, and removing non-country-contributing squares (e.g., Isle of Man) to support reproducibility.
- Data sharing and interoperability: provide crosswalks between 1978–2007 classifications and the current framework to facilitate longitudinal analyses across systems and formats.
- Limitations and uncertainty: acknowledge changes in class representation and sampling density when interpreting trend estimates, especially where Welsh or upland sub-classes alter precision.

## Endnotes and Context
- The document includes a historical appendix outlining the development of the ITE Land Classification and a concise summary table of sample numbers by survey and country.
- It emphasizes the importance of a coherent, well-documented sampling strategy for robust national and country-level habitat estimates and for informing policy-relevant environmental reporting.
