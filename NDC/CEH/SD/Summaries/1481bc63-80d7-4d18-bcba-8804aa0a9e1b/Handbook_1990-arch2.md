# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- The document outlines a comprehensive field survey programme to monitor and interpret changes in Britain’s countryside, focusing on land cover, vegetation, and landscape patterns over time.
- It emphasizes a two-tier data approach: ground-truth field data linked with satellite imagery to produce a current, analysable land-use dataset suitable for evaluating ecological systems and policy performance.

## Aims and Approach

- Produce consistent environmental condition data suitable for scrutiny of health and policy performance over time.
- Use standardised methods to collect, verify, quality-assure, cleanse, and transform data from established sources.
- Deliver outputs such as mapped data, reports, and charts, stored in appropriate data portals.
- Contribute to ongoing understanding of land-use change and support modelling of rural environments.

## Survey Design and Scope

- Sample design: 512 sites (squares) across Britain, grouped for survey by six ITE Research Stations; six-field teams (~85 squares per station).
- Re-survey planned for 1990 with a two-tier data capture approach:
  - Ground-truth land cover, vegetation, and landscape data.
  - Link ground data with satellite-derived land cover maps, building a Britain-wide land cover map.
- An important learning from prior surveys is the need to standardise field recording to minimise observer variation; quality control measures will be implemented and a clear Field Handbook is essential.

## Data collection framework

- Core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter covered in Section 7).
- Data capture tools include:
  - FABs (Field Assessment Booklets)
  - Enlarged 1:10,000 maps
  - Aerial photographs and site handouts
  - Weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, and other field equipment
- Data are intended to be recorded in a consistent format, using predefined codes and alphabetic/numeric composites to capture complex features efficiently.

## Equipment and Permissions

- Equipment provided by Merlewood (FABs, site photography aids, aerials, maps) and local ITE stations (location maps, basic field gear); surveyors supply personal items (clothing, camera, etc.).
- Permissions:
  - Prior contact with landowners/farmers is encouraged; obtaining permission for entire squares is crucial to avoid wasted effort.
  - If permission is refused, procedures include abandoning the square or adjusting survey strategy; documentation and coordination with Station Coordinators are required.
  - Ownership details, terms of access, and potential background information from landowners are to be recorded.

## Field Procedures and Mapping

- General surveying approach depends on land type and access; surveyors should assess the square, obtain access, plan a suitable route, and ensure complete coverage before leaving.
- Mapping (6.1) centers on annotating large-scale maps with data codes to capture land cover, boundaries, and landscape features.
- Aerial photo interpretation (API) provides supplementary boundary and feature data, to be used when ground truth agrees with API evidence, with guidelines for symbolization and boundary marking.
- The FABs consolidate data recording and maps into a Field Assessment Booklet; neatness and legibility are essential for subsequent analysis.

## Data Recording and Coding (FAB)

- Coding system:
  - Use of primary and secondary codes; primary codes are essential for each feature.
  - Alpha codes (A, B, C, etc.) can represent combinations of numeric codes to compress data on maps.
  - Codes distinguish boundaries, land use, vegetation types, and other landscape features; when boundaries no longer exist, special codes (e.g., 999) mark the change.
- Mapping and boundary conventions:
  - Clearly delineate actual vs. interpreted boundaries.
  - Minimum mappable units and lengths are defined (e.g., 1/25 ha and 20 m segments).
  - Non-vegetation features and isolated items may be marked with crosses to indicate presence without overloading the data sheet.
- Specific FAB sections include:
  - Ownership and farmer/landowner information
  - Physiography, inland water, and coastal features
  - Agriculture, natural vegetation, and land-use classifications
  - Boundaries, hedges, fences, and buildings/structures/communications
  - Road verges, tracks, and designated recreation areas
  - Descriptions for new developments and non-designated recreational signs

## Vegetation Recording and Plot Types

- Vegetation data collection focuses on plant species presence and cover, with a restricted list of 200 common species and a bryophyte/lichens subset.
- Plot types:
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 quadrats per square, open to semi-natural vegetation types
  - Nested sub-quadrats: up to five 4 m2 sub-quadrats within each large quadrat for detailed composition
  - Five small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) in different semi-natural/natural land-cover types per square
  - Linear plots: up to five 1 m-wide plots along hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides
  - Boundary plots adjacent to hedgerows/streams/roads
- Plot relocation and placement:
  - Pre-marked large quadrats are relocated where possible; where land use has changed, new quadrats are chosen based on boundary-adjacent land-cover types.
  - Permanent markers (metal plates) are used to facilitate future relocation; sketches and measurements accompany, with photographic documentation.
- Species identification and recording:
  - Species lists (including crops, grasses, forbs, ferns, and bryophytes) are used; multi-species, multi-code combinations may be needed for complex mosaics.
  - Where precise identification is difficult, acceptable species combinations are documented to maintain consistency with prior surveys.
  - Coverage estimates are recorded in 5% bands, with notes for unlisted species, and sketches on the back of sheets.

## Freshwater Sampling

- Two freshwater biota sampling schemes are employed:
  - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE program) – described in a separate handbook.
  - Freshwater biota from standing waters (NELUP program) – primarily water beetle sampling.
- Each square yields two standing-water samples (preferably vegetated) across diverse water-body types (lakes, ponds, pools, flushes, bogs) to reflect characteristic habitats within the square.
- Sample collection protocol emphasizes standardized labeling, time limits, and safe transport back to Merlewood.

## Photography and Post-Survey Procedures

- Photography:
  - Every vegetation plot is photographed to capture general appearance and context with reference landmarks.
  - Plot numbers are displayed on a plastic board at the plot edge.
- Post-survey processing:
  - End-of-day reviews to ensure no features were missed.
  - Data sheets should not be transcribed anew unless essential (to preserve original data integrity).
  - FABs and samples are transported back to ITE stations for processing and analysis.

## Endnotes and Revision

- The document is a Colin Barr-authored handbook with revisions (last updated February 1991; originally 1990) detailing implementation details for the Countryside Survey 1990.
- Emphasises continuing standardisation, data quality, and long-term monitoring as central to the Countryside Survey’s aims.

## Key Takeaways for Analysts

- A highly structured, codified data collection framework supports longitudinal environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Data are designed to be interoperable with satellite-derived land-cover data via a two-tier approach, enabling robust trend analyses.
- Standardised field methods (FABs, plotting, and coding) and rigorous permission procedures are critical to data consistency and data quality across years.
- The survey places strong emphasis on repeatability, site relocation rules, permanent marking for long-term tracking, and comprehensive vegetation and boundary characterization.
- Freshwater sampling and designated recreation/land-use categories enrich the dataset with biotic and socio-ecological dimensions.
