# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the development of the ITE Land Classification and the field-sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) from 1978 to 2007.
  - Explains how the sampling strategy is tied to its time-series data and why continuity with predecessors matters for change detection.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative national estimates and minimize bias.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attribute–based stratification of Great Britain into land classes used to guide sampling and estimate calculations.
  - Central-squares approach: originally selecting centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares classified to extend each class.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification (impact on sampling)
  - 1978: First version with 32 land classes; used to stratify a national sample.
  - 1984: Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total) for land-use survey; preserved 1978 framework for estimates.
  - 1990: All GB squares classified (All Squares Land Classification); 508 squares surveyed; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; results used 1990 classification for national estimates.
  - 1998/CS2000: Revised classification to support Scotland-only reporting and to increase class count to 40; new country-unit reporting (England with Wales, Scotland) introduced; additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland habitats module introduced.
  - 2007/CS2007: Wales-only reporting requirements lead to further Welsh-class subdivisions (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); sampling expanded to ensure at least 6 squares per new Welsh class; some English classes reduced in sample size; overall framework adjusted to maintain comparability and precision.

- Sampling framework across CS versions
  - 1978 CS: 256 squares total (8 per Land Class) to estimate national habitat areas.
  - 1984 CS: 384 squares (12 per class); prior 256 squares revisited; results published for landscape changes.
  - 1990 CS: 508 squares; all GB squares classified; repeat of key vegetation and habitat data; acknowledges need for revised, regional estimates.
  - 2000 CS (CS2000): expanded to enable separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); sub-divided land classes into country-unit versions; some class aggregations to balance representation; 30–59 additional squares across classes to ensure adequate representation.
  - 2007 CS (CS2007): refined Wales reporting with 5 new Welsh sub-classes; total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added; two English classes left with 4 squares each; updated England–Wales–Scotland sampling maps and numbers.

- Wales, England, Scotland adjustments and uplands
  - Separate country estimates introduced to provide England with Wales, and Scotland-specific results; required re-subdivision and reallocation of land-class strata.
  - Wales-specific adjustments led to Welsh-dedicated classes (5 additional Welsh classes) and targeted sampling to improve Wales precision.
  - An uplands module (30 squares) added in CS2000 to improve habitat estimates in upland/marginal areas of England and Wales; supports country-based reporting precision.

- How national estimates are computed
  - Estimates are derived from the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the land area of that class.
  - National estimates are sensitive to the Land Classification used; change in classification can affect cross-survey comparability.
  - Table 4 (not reproduced here) shows differences in sample sizes per class under the Original (1990) vs Latest classifications, illustrating potential inconsistencies if not carefully aligned.

- Data products and supporting materials
  - Land Classification maps accompany sampling maps (e.g., figures showing England with Wales and Scotland classifications; sample-square distributions).
  - Appendix and references provide historical context and methodological foundations (Indicator Species Analysis, classification procedures, and related methodological papers).

- Practical GIS implications
  - Land Classification serves as the primary stratification layer for GIS-based analysis and map production in Countryside Survey.
  - Year-to-year comparability requires careful handling of classification changes; cross-survey analyses may necessitate applying a consistent classification framework or mapping back to a common classification.
  - Country-unit classifications enable GIS users to produce England-with-Wales, Scotland, or Wales-only and England-only habitat estimates, aiding policy-relevant mapping and reporting.
  - Upland-module data enriches regional GIS analyses in higher-elevation areas, improving spatial precision for habitat status and change.
