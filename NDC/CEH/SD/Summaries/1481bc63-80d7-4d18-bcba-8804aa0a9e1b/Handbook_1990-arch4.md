# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

## Overview and Aims
- Purpose: monitor changes in land use and ecological conditions; update land-use databases; ensure outputs are current and relevant.
- 1990 resurvey builds on prior ITE surveys (1977/8, 1984, 1988) and links field data to satellite imagery for a Britain-wide land-cover map.
- Emphasizes standardised, high-quality field recording, broader collaboration, and integration of bottom-up and top-down data sources to support ecological Assessment and modelling.

## Study Design and Scope
- 512 squares to be surveyed in 1990, grouped into six teams from six ITE Research Stations; each team ~85 squares.
- Each square planned to take about three survey days; flexible scheduling; travel-based logistics emphasized to control costs.
- Prior surveys (1977/8, 1984, 1988) underpin the sampling frame; 1990 introduces additional data capture, more detailed information, and increased collaboration.
- Permanent ground-truthing strategy: metal markers to relocate plots in future surveys; relocation rules defined for changed land use.

## Data Collection Framework
- Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter covered separately in Section 7).
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) combines data recording with 6" (1:10,000) map annotation; use of integrated data codes to describe land cover, boundaries, and features.
- Plot structure:
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 quadrats per square, mapped and recorded with nested sub-quadrat data.
  - Small quadrats: five 2x2 m quadrats placed in natural or semi-natural land cover types.
  - Linear plots: up to five per square in hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides.
  - Aerial photo interpretation (API) supports boundary identification and feature delineation; AI conventions noted and to be followed in map annotation.
- Freshwater biota and terrestrial vegetation data captured on FAB along with ownership, physiography, and boundary information to enable cross-linking datasets.

## Data Recording and Coding
- FAB structure and workflow:
  - Page-by-page guidance for recording square-specific data, ownership, farmer information, physiography, land use, and vegetation.
  - Clear rules on exact placement, relocation, and recording of boundaries, edges, and parcel ownership (owner/tenant identification and cooperation ratings).
- Coding system:
  - Extensive use of primary and secondary codes to describe land cover, boundaries, buildings, roads, hedges, water features, and more.
  - Alpha codes used to compress complex multi-code observations (e.g., a boundary can be described by combining numeric codes represented by a single letter).
  - Rules for code ordering, dominance, and field judgment to maintain logical data structure and consistency.
- Vegetation and species data:
  - List of around 200 common plant species for recording; bryophytes and lichens recorded with restricted lists.
  - Species recorded to at least the species level where possible; combinations allowed when identification is uncertain.
  - Cover estimates recorded in 5% increments; total can exceed 100% due to layering.
  - Special handling for grasses, moorland, bracken, and woodland; multiple canopy layers and age/condition attributes captured for woodlands.
- Plot-specific guidance:
  - Quadrats: nested 200 m2 large quadrats with inner 4 m2 and successive nested scales; recording proceeds from inner to outer quadrats with Q coding to indicate presence.
  - Permanent markers and map sketches accompany each plot to facilitate relocation.
  - Location and relocation guidelines cover changes in land use, boundary features, hedgerows, streams, and roadsides, with procedures to move plots to appropriate features while preserving sampling intent.

## Field Procedures and Logistics
- Permissions:
  - Proactive engagement with farmers/landowners; initial introductions and written communications; explicit requirement to secure permission before surveying.
  - If permission is refused, predefined escalation: abandon the square or adjust survey strategy; keep Station Coordinators informed.
- Equipment:
  - FABs, 1:10,000 aerial photographs, site maps, clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, marker plates, measurement tools, navigation aids, first aid, and personal gear.
  - Local station support provides maps, field supplies, reference books, cameras, field guides, and safety gear.
- Plot layout and relocation:
  - Detailed guidelines for locating, relocating, and marking quadrats (large, small), hedgerow, stream, and roadside plots.
  - Rules ensure plots avoid overlap, maintain spacing, and reflect dominant boundary features.
  - Permanent markers (metal plates) placed adjacent to plot corners or field boundaries to ease future relocation.
- Photography and documentation:
  - All vegetation plots photographed for contextual reference; plot numbers displayed on boards for identification.
- Data and sample handling:
  - FABs and biological samples transported back to ITE Merlewood stations for analysis and archiving.

## Vegetation Sampling and Analysis
- Vegetation recording framework:
  - 6.2.2 outlines standardized vegetation recording across plots with a uniform data sheet for all plot types.
  - Large quadrats use 200 m2; nested quadrats progress from inner to outer with consistent 5% cover coding.
- Plot types and layout:
  - Quadrats: five large 200 m2 plots and five 4 m2 inner quadrats per large plot; additional smaller plots as needed.
  - Linear plots: boundary (10 m x 1 m), hedgerow, streamside, and roadside plots; special provisions for overlapping or closely spaced plots.
- Species identification guidelines:
  - General rules aim for species-level identification; allowances for difficult taxa via accepted combinations to maintain consistency with historical surveys.
- Data quality:
  - Emphasis on standardisation to reduce observer variation; quality control measures during the 1990 survey to ensure comparability with earlier surveys.
- Data completeness:
  - Complete square coverage is prioritized; even small corners should be coded or noted.

## Freshwater Biota and Sampling
- Freshwater biota collection (IFE and NELUP):
  - From each square: two samples from available standing waters (vegetated preferred) and designated freshwater pathways.
  - IFE focuses on freshwater biota; NELUP concentrates on water beetles (Newcastle University).
  - Clear labeling, time-limited searching (max 10 minutes per sample), preservation with formalin, and secure packaging for transport to Merlewood.

## End-of-Survey Procedures
- Daily review of FABs to ensure completeness and avoid omissions; retracing steps if necessary but with caution to avoid data contamination.
- Post-survey transport: FABs and samples forwarded to ITE stations promptly to support timely analysis and archival.

## Key Takeaways for Data Leaders
- Establishes a robust, repeatable data collection framework across multiple teams and years to enable long-term trend analysis and national-scale mapping.
- Emphasizes data standardization, comprehensive metadata, strict permissions, and field-based decision-making to maintain data integrity.
- Integrates multiple data streams (vegetation, land cover, boundaries, ownership, and freshwater biota) into a unified FAB-based workflow, with detailed coding schemes and relocation rules to support future comparability.
- Highlights a two-tier data strategy: detailed ground-truth field records (FAB and plots) plus API-assisted boundary identification, feeding into a Britain-wide land cover map and subsequent ecological modelling.
