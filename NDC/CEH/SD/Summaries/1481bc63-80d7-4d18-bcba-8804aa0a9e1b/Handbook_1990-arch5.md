# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - National program to monitor changes in land use, vegetation, and landscape in Britain, building on 1977/78, 1984, and 1988 surveys.
  - Aims include updating land-use databases, linking ground-truth data with satellite imagery, and tracking ecological change over time.
  - Output includes spatially explicit data across large numbers of squares, with emphasis on standardization and comparability over time.

- Data governance, standards, and metadata
  - Data are collected using standardized Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and 1:10,000 aerial/photo-enriched mapping.
  - A two-tier coding system (primary and secondary codes) with alpha codes (A, B, etc.) compresses complex land-cover attributes for map annotation.
  - Universal and coded metadata elements include square numbers, ownership, land use, physiography, boundaries, and vegetation types; clear guidance on handling missing or changing boundaries (e.g., 999 = no longer present).
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) provides guidance for identifying non-map features and boundary delineations, used in conjunction with field judgment.
  - Data quality and consistency are prioritized through a Field Handbook, standardization of observer practices, and permanent plot markers to enable reliable relocation.

- Data collection methods and data model
  - Data types: mapping, quadrat recording, and sampling (plus a separate freshwater biota component via IFE/NELUP).
  - Sample design: 512 squares surveyed in 1990; six groups with roughly 85 squares per group; two-year resurvey cycle with new and previously recorded squares.
  - Plot types and layout:
    - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots per square, centrally placed to capture habitat variation.
    - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots per square for fine-scale vegetation.
    - Linear plots: up to five roadside/hedgerow/streamside plots (10 m long, 1 m wide) with relocation rules when previous plots exist.
    - Boundary plots: linear plots located at field boundaries where relevant.
    - Verge plots: additional plots to sample road verges, including various road categories.
    - Boundary, stream, road verge, and hedgerow plots have specific relocation and placement rules to ensure comparability with earlier surveys.
  - Data capture forms and workflow:
    - FABs collect header, ownership, farmer information, physiography, land use, vegetation cover/types, and species lists (with emphasis on common species lists; bryophytes/lichens included in a defined subset).
    - Species identification uses a standardized list; certain difficult identifications may be recorded as accepted combinations.
    - Permanent markers (metal plates) and sketches are used to ensure accurate relocation and documentation.
  - vegetation sampling and recording:
    - Nested quadrats within large plots with a structured, stepwise species recording process; cover estimates reported in 5% increments.
    - Aerial photography and sketch maps accompany FAB entries to document plot layout and feature positions.
  - Freshwater sampling (NELUP/IFE):
    - Two standing-water samples per square, plus flowing-water biota samples per IFE protocols; locations and samples labeled and transported for analysis.

- Permissions, access, and field governance
  - Before surveying, obtain permissions from landowners/farmers to ensure legal access and obtain contextual information.
  - Procedures defined for refusals, partially accessible squares, and replacement squares; prior contact recommended to minimize delays.
  - Documentation of ownership/occupancy and contact details, with qualitative measures of owner cooperation.

- Data management, storage, and workflow
  - Data and samples are collected, then transported to ITE Merlewood for processing; FABs and related materials are prepared for transfer to data centers.
  - At day-end, surveyors review FABs for omissions; data integrity checks are emphasized to minimize rework.
  - The 1990 survey includes relocation/relayout rules to maintain temporal comparability with 1978/84 baselines; where habitats have changed, plots may be relocated according to defined criteria.
  - Photography is used to document plots; plot numbers are visibly marked for future reference.

- Quality assurance and challenges for data stewards
  - Key QA focus on standardizing field recording across observers, observer training, and consistent use of codes and layout conventions.
  - Challenges include incomplete or evolving user needs, timely data acquisition, ensuring metadata completeness, interoperability across multiple systems/formats, handling very large or heterogeneous datasets, and managing legacy data (e.g., older square boundaries or non-interoperable formats).
  - The handbook provides explicit guidance for field decisions, handling ambiguous categories, and documenting contextual notes to preserve data usability over time.
