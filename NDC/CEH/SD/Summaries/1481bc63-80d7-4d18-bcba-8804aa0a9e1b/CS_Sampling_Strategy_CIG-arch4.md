# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Describes the evolution and reasoning behind the Sampling Strategy and ITE Land Classification used for Countryside Survey field work up to 2007.
  - Emphasises that the modern CS methodology is built on three decades of development and is interlinked with previous surveys; understanding prior approaches is essential for interpreting time-series change.

- Core concepts and evolution of the ITE Land Classification
  - Stratified sampling foundation
    - Early motivation: use stratification to ensure samples are representative of the whole region and to avoid bias from purely random sampling.
    - Stratification mirrors ecological variation across land forms, altitude, geology, climate, and other environmental attributes.
  - 1978: First version of ITE Land Classification
    - Based on 1 km squares; developed using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on environmental attributes.
    - 1228 centre squares classified; 4 surrounding squares per centre classified, yielding 6039 classified squares.
    - 8 squares per land class sampled (total 256) to estimate national habitat areas.
  - 1984: Second field survey
    - Focus shifted to land use and habitat mapping; 12 km squares per class (384 total) surveyed.
  - 1990: Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
    - Land Classification expanded to classify every square in GB (all 1 km squares) with a conservative revision.
    - 508 squares surveyed; integration with Land Cover Map (from satellite imagery) for policy and scientific needs.
  - 1998–2000: Developments leading to CS2000
    - Recognised need to report separate estimates by country (England with Wales vs Scotland) and to improve upland habitat representation.
    - New Land Classification aimed to cover all GB squares more consistently; introduced country-unit subdivisions and 40 land classes.
    - Adjustments to sampling to ensure adequate representation in each country; added 19–22 extra squares and reallocation of some classes.
  - 2007: Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
    - Devolution-driven Wales-only reporting required further refinement.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), increasing strata to 45.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares to guarantee at least 6 squares per Welsh class; England adjustments maintained acceptable precision.
    - England Wales Scotland framework refined for Wales reporting; upland habitat module continued to improve country-specific estimates.

- Sampling framework and data products
  - 1 km square sampling unit
    - Central component across CS surveys; class allocations determine sample distribution.
  - Stratified random sampling by Land Classes
    - Estimates of habitat areas are derived from mean habitat per square within each class multiplied by the land-class area.
  - Country-based reporting and modules
    - Separate country estimates became a priority (England with Wales, Scotland) with corresponding class subdivisions and additional samples.
    - Upland habitat module added in CS2000 to bolster accuracy for upland estimates in England and Wales.
  - Output and interpretation
    - CS reports provide habitat status and change information by country, supported by Land Classification maps and evolving data frameworks.
    - Considerations are noted about consistency of estimates when the underlying land classification changes; using the latest classification improves internal consistency for a given survey, while original classifications provide cross-survey comparability.

- Country-specific adjustments and upland module
  - Welsh reporting
    - Wales required more granular representation post-devolution; Welsh-specific class subdivisions increased to five new country-unit classes.
    - Wales received a larger share of new squares to ensure robust Wales-only estimates.
  - England and Scotland
    - Adjustments ensured adequate representation in England and Scotland, with some reductions in sample counts in a few English classes deemed to cause only minor precision loss.
  - Upland habitats
    - An additional 30 squares allocated to upland and marginal upland land classes to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Data strategy implications for data leaders
  - Representativeness and comparability
    - Stratified sampling reduces bias and improves precision for national and country-level estimates.
    - Classification changes over time complicate cross-year comparability; aligning analyses to the latest classification within a survey improves internal consistency, while using the original classification across surveys supports long-term comparability.
  - Data governance and metadata
    - Clear documentation of Land Classification definitions, class subdivisions, and sampling adjustments is essential for reproducibility and future re-use.
    - Data lineage must track when and how classifications were revised and how country-unit estimates were derived.
  - Cross-country coordination
    - Requirements for England, Scotland, and Wales (and the Isle of Man) necessitated country-specific sampling frames and reporting units.
  - Data collection scope and modules
    - Modules (e.g., upland habitat surveys) add depth but require careful integration with core sampling to maintain coherent time-series data.
  - Practical considerations
    - Balancing precision across classes and countries with logistical constraints led to targeted additions or reductions in sampling for particular classes.

- Endnotes and historical context
  - CS reports and key references document the evolving methodology and its application to policy-relevant ecological assessments.
  - The document provides a brief history of the ITE Land Classification and its role in long-running countryside monitoring.

- Takeaways for data leaders
  - Build sampling strategies that acknowledge regional diversity and policy needs through robust stratification.
  - Plan for country-specific reporting when governance structures change (devolution), including dedicated class subdivisions and targeted sampling.
  - Maintain rigorous metadata and documentation to support cross-year comparability and future re-use.
  - Use the latest classification for current surveys while preserving the option to reference original classifications for historical consistency.
