# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise the public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality protects sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permission for surveys.
- Public release requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## Circumstances for release and precision levels
- Data can show whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references are only released if pre-processing by CEH avoids release, or in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases with licenced access, where the requester proves IP data has equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares could reveal locations; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- Four-digit releases do not require the same IP confidentiality criteria as six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other obligations.
- Upon licence expiry, data must be destroyed; written confirmation of destruction required.
- No data or derivatives should enable third parties to locate CS squares; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data cannot be used to plan or visit CS squares.
- Location data cannot be used to assess compliance by landowners.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
- Four-digit licences are similar to six-digit but do not require the highest IP confidentiality criteria.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from released data.

## Responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences; signatures from authorised representatives required.
- If a release is denied, CEH follows Act and Regulations procedures and supports the decision.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report on licence approvals, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within moderate demand; case-by-case for external organisations.
- Partners and potential users should consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be part of collaboration or paid engagement, negotiated case by case.

## Implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Enables controlled access to location-referenced CS data (four-digit and, in exceptional cases, six-digit) to support regional environmental monitoring and policy scrutiny.
- Balances data utility with protections for sampling integrity and landowner cooperation.
- Requires formal licensing, secure data handling, and adherence to usage constraints (no site visits planning, no landowner compliance checks, destruction after use).
- CEH acts as the gatekeeper and processor of requests; potential users should engage with CEH early to define requirements and ensure compliant use.
