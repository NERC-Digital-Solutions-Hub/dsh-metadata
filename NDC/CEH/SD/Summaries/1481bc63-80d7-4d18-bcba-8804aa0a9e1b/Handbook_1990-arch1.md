# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - ITE’s land use studies aim to collect data, monitor change, map land cover, and enable ecological modelling and prediction.
  - Builds on two prior GB surveys (1977/8 and 1984) and a 1988/1990 resurvey plan.
  - A two-tier approach: ground-field surveys linked with satellite imagery to produce a Britain-wide land cover map and ground-truth data.

- Aims for the 1990 survey
  - Update land use and vegetation data to monitor ongoing countryside changes.
  - Expand data capture to finer detail and increase collaboration with researchers.
  - Create ground-truth data to improve bottom-up field results and satellite-based projections.
  - Standardise recording to enable robust statistical analysis and cross-study comparability.

- Survey design and planning
  - 512 squares will be surveyed in 1990; split into six groups, each by one of six ITE Research Stations.
  - Each square allocated about three survey days; flexible scheduling; emphasis on avoiding unnecessary revisits; travel-based costs with no initial overtime pay (compensated by time off in lieu if needed).
  - 128 new squares in 1990, and 128 squares previously unsampled for vegetation plots; broader sampling to cover additional land cover types.
  - Survey teams coordinate locally; day-to-day logistics managed by Station Coordinators.

- Equipment and data products
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) plus 1:10,000 aerial photographs, maps, and project handouts.
  - Weatherproof recording tools, markers, and sampling equipment; permanent markers to relocate plots in future surveys.
  - Data are recorded with a standardized coding system designed to be extensible and machine-readable.

- Permissions and access
  - Prior contact with farmers/landowners is important to gain access and background information.
  - Clear procedures for handling refusals, including abandoning a square or relocating parts of it, with prioritisation of obtaining access for the entire square when possible.
  - Documentation and ownership information collected on the FAB; field teams encouraged to engage with landowners to build goodwill.

- Data recording framework (FAB)
  - Three core elements: mapping, quadrat recording, and sampling (with vegetation plots and later sections on sampling described in Section 7).
  - FABs support a hierarchical, coded dataset: primary and secondary codes, with a logic for ordering and combining codes to describe land-use, vegetation, boundaries, and features.
  - Emphasis on field-level decisions: features should be coded on-site; if uncertain, notes or comments should accompany codes.

- Mapping, coding, and API (6.1)
  - Mapping uses enlarged 1:10,000 maps; combine multiple data codes per feature to create a rich, coded record.
  - Alpha-numeric coding system to compress multiple descriptors into single map annotations; codes linked logically (e.g., dominant codes first).
  - Boundaries (fences, walls, hedges) and boundary changes are carefully annotated; 999 used to indicate boundaries that no longer exist.
  - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) used to aid feature identification and boundary delineation, with conservative guidance for ground-truthing.

- Field data recording and FAB completion (6.1.2)
  - FABs must be neatly completed; each page includes square number references and owner/tenancy information.
  - Ownership, farmer interviews, physiography/inland water/coastal features, and building/land-use details are recorded with structured prompts and codes.
  - For complex mosaics, dominant primary codes determine the recorded description; use cross-references and comments where needed.
  - A detailed, page-by-page guide exists within the FAB for consistent completion.

- Vegetation sampling and plot design (6.2)
  - Two main plot sizes per square:
    - Large 200 m2 quadrats, with nested 4 m2 quadrats for detailed species recording.
    - Five small 2 m x 2 m quadrats placed in natural or semi-natural land cover types.
  - Standardised procedure for recording from nested quadrats, including 5% cover category estimates and a formal list of ~200 common plant species, plus restricted bryophyte/lichen lists.
  - Sketches, photography, and specimen collection recommended when identification is uncertain.
  - Permanent markers (metal plates) locate quadrats for future relocation; detailed relocation guidance provided for edge cases and boundary-plots.
  - Five additional small quadrats for semi-natural habitats are placed after land cover mapping to ensure representation of habitat types.

- Plot types and relocation rules (6.2.3, 6.2.4)
  - Linear plots along hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides (up to 5 per square per type); boundary plots prioritized when locating linear plots.
  - Guidelines for relocating from 1978-established plots; if hedgerow or stream position changes, plots are moved within rules to ensure coverage without violating minimum distances.
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) detail positioning relative to features and required distances (1 m width, etc.).

- Species identification and data thresholds (6.2.5)
  - Surveyors aim for species-level records; where difficult, accepted species combinations are allowed to maintain consistency with prior surveys.
  - Extensive lists of frequent species across crops, grasses, creeping plants, forbs, woody species, bryophytes, and lichens guide coding.
  - Use of up to three cover codes per feature for mosaics; 5% cover categories for each recorded species.
  - Bryophytes/lichens recorded with a restricted list.

- Freshwater biota sampling (7)
  - Two freshwater biota samples per square: flowing-water biota (IFE) and standing-water biota (NELUP, water beetles focus).
  - IFE sampling protocol described in a separate handbook; NELUP sampling specifics are carried out by Newcastle University staff.
  - Points for sampling marked on maps; bottles labeled with square, date, surveyor, and transported to Merlewood.

- Photography and documentation (8)
  - Print photographs of each vegetation plot; plot numbers displayed on a board at the plot edge to document location relative to marker plates.

- Procedures after fieldwork (Subsequent survey)
  - End-of-day checks to ensure completeness and avoid data omissions.
  - Data and FABs transported to ITE stations promptly; re-mapping and re-recording only in exceptional cases of damage.

- Administrative and metadata notes
  - The document emphasizes data traceability: recording square numbers, ownership, land-use categories, and detailed plot metadata.
  - Colin Barr authored/revised the handbook (1990; revised February 1991).

- Summary for data analysts
  - The survey provides a large, standardized, codified dataset linking ground-truth vegetation and land-use with satellite-derived land cover maps.
  - Rich metadata allow correlations between vegetation types, land management, boundaries, and landscape features across 512 squares.
  - The methodology supports monitoring temporal change, spatial pattern analysis, and modelling of ecological responses to land-use change, with explicit QA steps and relocation protocols to maintain comparability over time.
