# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Overview
  - A quality assurance review of the 1990 Countryside Survey to quantify the accuracy of field recording, explain observer-related differences, relate findings to previous work, and recommend methodological improvements to enhance accuracy and confidence in statistics.

- Aims and scope
  - Quantify accuracy of field recording and changes in statistics.
  - Explain differences in recording by observer, time of year, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
  - Compare with previous ITE survey work.
  - Propose survey methodology modifications to improve accuracy and confidence in results.

- Methodology
  - Two QA series:
    - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares, relocation based on original sketch maps; two independent assessors.
    - 1991: added photographs of individual plots; single 1 km square from each terrain class; 14-day window between original survey and QA visit; included self-assessment of additional squares.
  - Plot types covered: four quadrats (200 m2 X-plots, 4 m2 Y-plots) and several linear/roadside types, with relocation attempts using sketches, plates, photographs.
  - Plate relocation: assessed effectiveness of relocating corner plates (71% recovery in autumn 1990 with five-minute search; 65% plate-level and 87% plot-level recovery in 1991).
  - Additional QA elements: nine predetermined points per quarter for landcover and boundaries; self-assessed squares; photographs to aid relocation.
  - Data focus: species lists, cover estimates, land-use mapping codes, and boundary/vegetation features.

- Data quality metrics and key findings
  - Species concordance and agreement
    - Four concordance indices used to compare plots between surveys (i = simple % agreement; ii = agreement excluding potentially erroneous T1 records; iii = agreement treating initial T1 as more correct; iv = % accuracy excluding T2 errors).
    - Autumn 1990 partial QA suggested ~45% agreement; full 1991 QA produced ~60.9% overall concordance (between 1990 original and 1991 reassessment).
    - Initial efficiency of recording (1990 survey) around 74% (range across plots/square results).
    - Seasonal and annual differences (1990 drought year vs 1991 normal year) contributed substantially to observed species changes; in upland areas, recording efficiency tended to be higher for certain plot types and lower in others.
  - Species-level changes
    - Some species showed genuine population changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Galium aparine, Cirsium arvense); others appeared affected by recording differences or seasonal effects (e.g., Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis).
    - Across plot groups, no single species group showed a statistically significant change in cumulative frequency, though individual species fluctuated.
    - Training emphasis recommended for distinguishing grasses and bryophytes; bryophyte inclusion suggested where vegetation classification relies on bryophyte data.
  - Plot relocation and plot-type performance
    - X plots and roadside/linear features relatively easier to relocate; Y plots (smaller 4 m2) were particularly challenging; plate-based relocation aided, but unenclosed uplands remained time-consuming.
    - Photographs substantially improved relocation accuracy; annotation of photographs and distance bearing information recommended.
  - Land-use and boundary mapping (codes)
    - Primary land-use codes were generally reliable; boundary codes also showed good concordance, but some mis-matches occurred (especially for hedges and boundary qualifiers).
    - Marsh (code 114) was used inconsistently; upland grassland (102) required sub-division; bog/peatland distinctions caused disagreement.
    - Recommendations to refine land-use classifications (introduce new sub-codes, clearer definitions) and limit emphasis on detailed vegetation cover for mapping codes.
  - Mapping of vegetation and cover
    - Point-by-point mapping concordance varied by land class; high agreement in lowland areas, more variability in uplands due to unenclosed land and relocation challenges.
    - Two most prevalent species per vegetation unit recommended for mapping to improve reproducibility; co-dominants had much lower likelihood of concordant recording across surveys.
  - Overall ecological gradient analysis
    - DECORANA first-axis scores shifted between 1990 and 1991 in a manner consistent with broader land-use changes observed in earlier ECOLUC analyses; uplands showed distinctive vegetation patterns that were relatively resistant to change.
  - Implications for timing of QA
    - Greater agreement and lower error rates when QA is conducted in the same season/year as the original survey; year-to-year climatic variation can dominate observed changes.

- Implications for data governance and organizational learning
  - Photographic and plate-based localization are valuable data governance tools for data provenance and reproducibility.
  - Consistent and explicit plotting coordinates, distances to fixed features, and compass bearings dramatically facilitate relocation and reduce misalignment.
  - Training and documentation gaps identified (e.g., bryophyte/grass identification, cover coding, and specific land-use codes) point to needed enhancements in data governance documentation and staff training.
  - Seasonality and climate effects must be accounted for in change statistics; QA should be aligned seasonally when feasible to improve comparability.
  - Metadata and codebook clarity are critical; proposed code refinements and standardized mapping approaches to improve interoperability and downstream usability (e.g., National Vegetation Classification alignment).

- Recommendations (highlights)
  - R1: Retain bryophyte/lichen elements in surveys, with field manuals and habitat information to aid identification.
  - R2: Conduct QA as close as possible to the original survey time to minimize seasonal/annual variation confounding results.
  - R3: Ensure QA photographers annotate photos and link them to plot locations, including distances to nearby features.
  - R4: Use metal marker plates for X plots where feasible; allocate adequate personnel for upland relocations.
  - R5: Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with survey tape, oriented N-S along the side and placed at the SE corner to minimize orientation errors.
  - R6–R7: Provide clearer guidance for annotating and linking plots to photographs and sketch maps; ensure consistent relocation protocols.
  - R8–R12: Refine land-use and boundary coding (e.g., subdivide 102 upland grassland; recognize 112–114 marsh/bog distinctions; treat wet heath as a primary code; restrict boundary coding to hedge vs other classes; simplify cover coding to improve reproducibility; map only the two most prevalent species for land-use parcels; introduce new codes for specific land types like lowland rush pasture).
  - R13–R15: Improve mapping of vegetation cover by focusing on key species, enhance training on distinguishing closely related grasses, and consider expanding bryophyte lists where vegetation classification relies on bryophytes.
  - R16–R18: Encourage same-year QA, consistent seasonal timing, and improved documentation to reduce mis-match sources.
  - R19–R20: Provide better guidance on plot positioning in unenclosed areas, and consider allocating extra resources for upland relocation tasks.
  - R21–R24: Expand and formalize the codebooks for land-use and boundary features, including clearer definitions and intended usage rules to minimize interpretive variation.
  - R25–R28: Enhance data governance around the use of mapping codes, reduce excessive code complexity, and standardize level-of-detail in mapping descriptors.

- Conclusions for data leaders
  - The QA demonstrates that significant improvements can be achieved through enhanced relocation aids (photographs, plates), standardized plotting procedures, targeted training (grasses, bryophytes, and boundary features), and refined coding schemes.
  - While some year-to-year variability in ecology is real, much of the observed variation in species recording arises from observer and methodological factors; aligning QA timing and improving documentation yields substantial gains in data reliability.
  - The findings support a data governance approach that emphasizes provenance, standardized codes, reproducible mapping practices, and seasonally aligned QA processes to support robust, comparable trend analyses over time.
