# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why confidentiality
- Locations are kept confidential to preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- These elements protect scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Approximate location access: four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence to help identify if squares fall within predetermined areas.
- Precise location access: six-digit grid references require pre-processing by CEH; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases, external release under licence may be granted if the requester proves their IP is equally or more confidential than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed at the end of the licensing period.
- No data or derivatives may be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; data cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards equivalent to JCOP if requested.
- Four-digit releases have IP confidentiality criteria that are less stringent than six-digit releases; both types prohibit attempts to identify precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- Decisions on exceptional releases are made by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH will follow the UK Act and Regulations to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS partnership use, CEH aims to provide necessary pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- It is recommended that potential users consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may be involved in collaboration or support, and involvement may be negotiated or paid.

## Practical guidance for data use
- Consult CEH early to define requirements and appropriate use of CS location data.
- Expect formal licensing, handling, and destruction requirements; comply with confidentiality and IP terms.
- Internal users may receive pre-processing support to facilitate safe, compliant analysis.
