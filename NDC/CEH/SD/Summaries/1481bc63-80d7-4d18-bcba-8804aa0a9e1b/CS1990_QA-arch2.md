# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose of QA: quantify accuracy and reliability of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey; explain differences due to observer error, season, location, and information type; relate findings to prior work; recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Background and aims

- Field surveys with many recorders have inherent variation despite training and supervision.
- QA exercises compared original survey records with re-surveys using sketch maps, photographs, and later plate-based relocation to assess consistency and reliability.
- Aims included measuring accuracy of field recording, identifying sources of error, comparing with previous surveys, and recommending methodological modifications.

## Methods

- Two QA series in autumn 1990 and summer 1991:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original squares; relied on sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - Summer 1991: added photographs; used single 1 km square per terrain class; included self-assessment subset.
- Plot types (representing Countryside Survey 1990) included quadrats (X and Y plots), roadverges, hedges, streamsides, and boundaries.
- Relocation evaluation categorized as:
  - Plot and plate relocated
  - Plate relocated but not plot
  - Plate not found (insufficient information)
- Species concordance assessed using multiple indices (agreement, percent agreement, accuracy, etc.).
- Cover values and land-use mapping were also compared between times.
- Population-level analyses included DECORANA ordination to assess ecological gradients and changes.

## Key findings

- Plot relocation and plate finding
  - Plate relocation recovery around 71% in autumn 1990 with five-minute searches; overall regeneration success varied by plot type.
  - In 1991, relocation success improved with photographs aiding position re-establishment; overall plot relocation efficiency improved (data indicate substantial gains from photography and re-surveying). 
- Species concordance and changes
  - Early QA indicated modest species agreement between T1 (original) and T2 (QA): about 60–61% concordance, with higher alignment when excluding species not identifiable in QA timing.
  - Full QA using 21 squares yielded 47.1% agreement for initial analyses; when seasonal differences were accounted for (removing species not identifiable in QA timing), mean differences in species recorded per plot were reduced but still indicated more species were recorded in QA, suggesting real year-to-year or seasonal differences plus recording improvements.
  - 1991 QA showed a statistically significant increase in mean species per plot (approx. 2.7 more species per plot for pooled data), largely attributed to real seasonal/growing-year differences rather than assessor learning alone (though some portion likely due to improved recording efficiency).
  - In upland vs. lowland results, lower accuracy was observed in lowland arable-dominated plots, possibly due to higher species diversity and management complexity.
- Effects of seasonal and location differences
  - Seasonal effects (summer vs autumn) and drought conditions markedly influenced species detection; caution urged when comparing change statistics across land-use types or across years with different climates.
  - Upland plots generally exhibited less seasonal variation in accuracy than lowland plots.
- Cover estimates
  - Cover estimates for common species showed significant differences between survey times for a few species, with many others showing non-significant differences; overall, cover data were sensitive to seasonal and identification differences.
  - Bryophyte and certain grass identifications were highlighted as areas needing improved training and clearer handbook guidance.
- Mapping and land-use codes
  - Primary land-use codes were generally reliable for major habitat types; minor categories were less tested due to infrequent occurrence.
  - Pairwise code concordance between land-use and boundary features was high, but some mis-matches occurred due to interpretive variability in boundary coding and unfamiliar qualifiers for hedges, boundaries, and forb cover.
  - The study recommended reducing reliance on detailed species-level cover in mapping and focusing on the most prevalent species to improve reproducibility; consider subdividing certain upland codes (e.g., upland grassland) to better capture vegetation variation.
- Plot-level and land-class analysis
  - DECORANA analyses suggested a general shift consistent with known ecological gradients between uplands and lowlands and with historical data, though year-to-year variation could obscure long-term trends in some land-use classes.
  - By plot type and land class, movement along the ecological gradient varied, with upland moors/heaths showing distinct, stable patterns less influenced by recent agricultural changes; lowland arable plots showed more pronounced shifts associated with crop and management changes.
- Mapping of vegetation and boundaries
  - Point-based mapping of land-use and vegetation showed high concordance for lowland areas but more variability in upland areas, partly due to localization challenges in unenclosed land.
  - The study emphasized improved documentation of plot locations and greater use of photographs plus ground markers to enhance relocation accuracy.

## Recommendations (selected highlights)

- R1 Recording of lichens to be retained for general surveys; include species samples and habitat context in training.
- R2 QA should be conducted as close as practical to the time of the initial survey to minimize seasonal/annual variation effects.
- R3 Photographs should be annotated and linked to the relevant plots; include distance to nearby identifiable features; surveyors should annotate to improve relocation.
- R4 Use metal marker plates to mark X plots in enclosed land to aid relocation.
- R5 4 m2 (Y) plots should be defined with a survey tape; orient so the side (not diagonal) is N-S and place at the SE corner.
- R6 (implied through later sections): Strengthen bryophyte and grass identification training; consider adding target species lists and habitat context in training materials.
- R7–R12 (land-use and mapping codes):
  - Subdivide and refine key land-use codes (e.g., upland grassland categories) to reduce ambiguity.
  - Introduce codes for lowland rush pasture and wet heath as distinct primary types.
  - Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge presence and use qualifying codes for species composition.
  - Limit mapping to the most prevalent species for vegetation units to improve reproducibility.
  - Expand and standardize bryophyte-related coding for ecosystem classification.
  - Align QA with the same season/year as the original survey to minimize climate-driven differences.
  - Simplify cover data collection to focus on predominant species to improve mapping consistency.
- R13–R15 (additional practicalities):
  - Improve clarity of qualifying codes and reduce mis-use of forb cover and hedge condition codes.
  - Provide dictionaries or field aids for distinguishing similar taxa during fieldwork.
  - Include explicit guidance on distance and compass bearings in location sketches; ensure time is allotted for annotating photographs in the field.
  - Consider increasing the use of ground-truthed photo-aids to aid relocation in unenclosed areas.
- R16–R18 (data handling and integrity):
  - Document and standardize the process for adjudicating T1 vs T2 errors (mis-identifications, overlooked species, management changes, plot mis-location).
  - Emphasize reporting of data quality alongside ecological interpretation in outputs.

## Implications for environmental monitoring and data quality

- The Countryside Survey QA demonstrates that, while field-recording is prone to observer and seasonal/annual variations, methodical QA—especially with photographic relocation and clear mapping protocols—substantially improves reliability.
- The analyses highlight the need to:
  - Coordinate QA timing with the original survey period to minimize seasonal effects.
  - Provide explicit training and field guides for challenging taxa (grasses, bryophytes).
  - Use standardized, parsimonious coding schemes for land-use and vegetation to maximize reproducibility across time and observers.
  - Leverage photographs and ground markers as standard practice for robust plot relocation, particularly in unenclosed landscapes.

## Conclusions for future surveys

- Photographs are a vital relocation aid; proper annotation and clear linking to plots enhance efficiency and accuracy.
- Location data should include distance and bearing details; ensure feature documentation accompanies sketches and photos.
- Plate markers were effective in enclosed areas; more resources are needed for relocation in unenclosed uplands.
- Seasonal and climatic differences between survey years can significantly influence species detection and community composition; aim to conduct QA in the same season and year as the original survey where possible.
- The mapping and land-use coding framework should be streamlined and expanded to capture key habitat distinctions, reducing ambiguity and improving comparability over time.
