# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy aims to maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity. It covers survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.

## Current CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permissions for surveying land.

## Circumstances for release and precision levels
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to indicate which 10x10 km grid square a CS square falls into.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references are normally guarded; CEH can perform pre-processing to avoid releasing exact locations; in very exceptional cases, external release under licence may occur if the requester demonstrates that their data/assets carry equal or higher confidentiality protections.
- Spatial data within squares (habitats, linear features): treated as equivalent to location data and released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Licence terms and conditions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed at licence end.
- No data may be shared with third parties in a way that could compromise square confidentiality; not used to plan visits or to assess landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must show evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; license terms for spatial data and four-digit references prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Roles, processes, and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases, applies policy principles, and issues hardcopy licences signed by an authorised senior official.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under UK law (FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations).
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS-partner use; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
