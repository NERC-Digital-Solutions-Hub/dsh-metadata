# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose: outline the scope of quality assurance (QA) for the 1990 Countryside Survey, present results, and provide recommendations to improve accuracy and confidence in survey statistics.
- Context: field work involved many recorders; QA aimed to quantify accuracy, explain observer/seasonal differences, relate to prior work, and propose methodological improvements.

## Aims and Scope

- quantify accuracy of field recording in 1990 and assess accuracy of change statistics.
- explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- relate conclusions to previous comparative work (ITE surveys).
- recommend methodological modifications for future surveys to improve accuracy and confidence.

## Methods

- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 of the original survey squares; used sketch maps for plot relocation; two assessors evaluated outputs.
  - 1991: expanded QA with photographs of individual plots; same or related plots reassessed; included one 1 km square from each terrain class.
- Sampling design:
  - Each square quarter resurveyed to include one of each plot type (six types total).
  - Plot types include quadrats (200 m2 X-plots and 4 m2 Y-plots) and various linear plots (road verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries).
  - Aimed to relocate buried plates marking quadrat corners, using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors.
- Data and comparisons:
  - Species concordance metrics: percentage agreement, agreement, and % accuracy (with adjustments for T1 and T2 variations).
  - Analyses by plot type, landclass (lowland vs upland), and year.
  - Photos used to re-establish exact positions; assessment of relocation success and time.
- Annexed materials:
  - detailed tables of plotting, relocation success, species frequencies, and land-use code mappings.
  - DECORANA ordination (axis 1) to assess ecological gradient shifts.

## Key Findings

- Overall reliability and accuracies
 - 1990 QA initial species agreement across plots: approximately 60% (varied by metric; early analysis suggested around 45–60%).
 - 1991 QA (with photographs) showed improved relocation and consistency; overall agreement around 60.9% when including all assessments.
 - Initial efficiency of recording for 1990 survey averaged around 58–74% across plots; with refinements (e.g., 1991 QA, integration of photographs) efficiency increased toward a maximum around 79% in some cases.
 - Seasonal and drought effects significantly impacted species lists; changes between 1990 and 1991 often reflected real ecological shifts as well as recording differences.
- Plot relocation and the role of photographs
 - Plate relocation (using physical markers) achieved about 71% success autumn 1990; 65% of plates and 87% of plots found in 1991 QA; photographs greatly improved re-location accuracy, though Y plots (the smallest) remained challenging.
 - Photographs and sketches together substantially enhance relocation efficiency, particularly in unenclosed land; metal plates valuable but relocation in uplands time-consuming (around 30 minutes per plot).
- Plot type and landscape effects
 - X plots (larger, fixed) were easier to relocate and yielded higher accuracy than Y plots (smaller quadrats); road verge plots showed comparatively high relocation success.
 - Lowest QA accuracy observed in lowland arable (LC) and some marginal upland areas; upland cores (MA/UP) showed more stable vegetation, but mapping and relocation remained challenging in unenclosed areas.
- Species recording, identification and cover
 - Common species frequencies generally remained similar in order, but absolute counts varied due to seasonality and management (e.g., crop changes, herbicide use).
 - Certain taxa (grasses and bryophytes) were frequently mis-recorded or variably identified; bryophyte data suggested need for targeted training.
 - Cover estimates at nine-point plot locations showed limited but notable differences; concordance for dominant species at a point remained relatively high (about 81% for major species at a point), but co-dominant matches dropped (around 34%).
- Land-use and boundary mapping
 - Primary land-use codes were highly reliable; boundary codes were slightly less consistent due to interpretation and qualifiers.
 - Mapping variability largely reflected interpretive differences, not data collection errors; assessors were generally consistent across time and with previous assessments.
- DECORANA analysis and ecological gradient
 - Axis 1 captured a gradient (shade tolerance vs. light demand) with upland vs. lowland separation; no single-year shift fully explained all variation, suggesting both climatic year effects and genuine long-term change.
 - Across the time series (1978, 1990, 1991), overall trends aligned with earlier ECOLUC findings in lowlands but showed greater variability in marginal and upland areas, potentially due to drought and land-use changes.

## Recommendations and Actions

- Data collection and field methods
 - Photograph and annotate plot locations; ensure distance and compass bearings are recorded for features to aid relocation (Recommendation 3).
 - Use metal marker plates for X plots wherever feasible; plan for additional manpower in difficult upland relocation (Recommendation 4).
  - Improve placement and orientation guidelines for 4 m2 Y plots (Recommendation 5); orient using a fixed corner and explicit alignment rules.
- Training and taxonomic focus
 - Emphasize bryophyte and grass identification in training; provide habitat-specific reference materials; record a limited set of dominant species per plot to improve reproducibility (Recommendations 1 and 12).
 - Increase attention to seasonal and habitat-specific changes; QA should be conducted as close as practical to the initial survey period (Recommendation 2; further supported by seasonal findings in paragraph 64).
  - Expand or subdivide land-class codes to improve precision (Recommendations 8–10); introduce codes for lowland rush pasture and reclassify upland grassland categories for clearer mapping.
- Data coding, mapping and consistency
 - Limit focus on broad cover categories; record the two most prevalent species per land-use parcel to reduce ambiguity and improve reproducibility (Recommendation 12).
 - Improve definitions and usage of boundary and hedge codes; ensure qualifiers are clearly captured and consistently applied (Recommendations 11 and related notes).
 - Provide dichotomous keys for land-use codes to reduce ambiguity and improve inter-operator consistency (Recommendation 8).
- Temporal alignment and QA scope
 - Keep QA within the same year/season as the original survey when possible, to minimize climatic and phenological variability (Recommendation 7).
  - Where long-term comparisons are necessary, stratify analyses by landuse and habitat type to account for differential variability (as suggested in Tables 6–9 and related discussions).

## Conclusions

- Photographic aids and precise plot relocation are critical to improving the reproducibility and accuracy of vegetation surveys across time.
- The 1990 survey's QA revealed meaningful sources of variation—observer error, seasonal/annual changes, plot relocation challenges, and cover-value assignments—requiring targeted training and methodological refinements.
- The 1991 QA, leveraging photographs, produced a noticeable improvement in relocation and consistency, though some plot types (notably Y plots) remained intrinsically difficult to relocate accurately.
- Mapping and code systems were generally robust but benefited from clearer categories, standardized qualifiers, and emphasis on dominant species to enhance reproducibility.
- Overall, the QA results align with longer-term ecological trends while highlighting the need for year- and habitat-specific considerations in future countryside surveys.
