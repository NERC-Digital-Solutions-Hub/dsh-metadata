## Usage considerations for analysts
- Suitable for analyzing correlations between landscape themes, species cover, land use, and tree characteristics (e.g., DBH) at a 1km scale across Great Britain.
- Enables integration with ITE Land Classification (LC07) and country/county-level stratifications.
- Useful for exploring relationships between environmental zone descriptions and land-use themes.
- Potential to combine with other Countryside Survey datasets or 2007 LC07 classifications for temporal or methodological comparison.
