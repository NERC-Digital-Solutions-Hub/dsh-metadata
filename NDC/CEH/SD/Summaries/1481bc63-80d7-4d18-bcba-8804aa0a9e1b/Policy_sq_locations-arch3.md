# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- The policy aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

## Current Countryside Survey partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, both essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing access for future surveys.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## Circumstances for location release and precision
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence to identify squares within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) may be released only in very exceptional circumstances under licence, requiring demonstration that associated IP data carries equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
- Four-digit releases are less stringent than six-digit releases; licences for four-digit data prohibit attempts to pinpoint exact square locations.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to approved individuals.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed after the period.
- No data or images should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations.
- Data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit release terms are similar to six-digit, but do not require the highest IP confidentiality criteria; a clause prevents attempts to derive precise locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate terms.
- Licences must be signed by a senior, authorised representative of the licensee organization.
- If a release is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision rationales.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support for CS partners within reasonable demand; other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to use any data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
