# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

## Overview
- Guidelines for a national field survey to sample land use, vegetation, landscapes, and related ecological data in Britain.
- Builds on ITE Land Classification System; aims to monitor changes, provide ground-truth data, and link top-down satellite imagery with field observations.
- Survey in 1990 planned as a two-tier approach with a two-stage data collection: mapping and recording, plus sampling (quadrats and plots). Targets 512 squares, with 128 new and 128 previously surveyed squares.

## Aims and Scope
- Update land-use databases and ensure outputs of other activities are current and relevant.
- Characterise land classes, monitor changes, and support ecological modelling and evaluation.
- Standardise field recording to reduce observer variation and improve data quality, enabling robust change detection and pattern analysis.

## Planning and Logistics
- Six ITE Research Stations each manage about 85 squares; teams operate with flexibility to accommodate leave, travel time, and travel-based planning.
- Travel costs managed without overtime; daily travel preferred; scheduling supports local travel, multi-week and weekend arrangements.
- Sampling framework requires careful planning to ensure broad representation across land-use types and accessibility.

## Equipment and Resources
- Provided by Merlewood and local ITE Stations:
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, large-scale maps, and project handouts.
  - Weatherproof clipboards, colored pens, survey poles, measuring tapes, marker plates, navigation aids, and safety gear.
- Additional items supplied by surveyors as needed (personal gear, camera, field references).

## Permissions and Land Access
- Permissions are essential for legal and background information access; maintain good relations with landowners/farmers.
- Procedures for new and known landowners; if permission is refused, predefined steps apply (abandon square or relocate parts, depending on extent of access).

## Data Recording: Field Assessment Booklets (FAB)
- The Countryside Survey 1990 comprises three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling, with sampling covered in Section 7.
- FABs consolidate data and maps; must be completed neatly to ensure interpretability and avoid data losses.
- Ownership, farmer information, and physiography/inland/coastal features are documented; a robust coding system (primary and secondary codes) is used to convey complex land-cover information succinctly.

## Mapping (Section 6.1)
- Annotate enlarged 6" maps (1:10,000) with standardized codes; where necessary, combine multiple codes into single alpha-character codes to save space.
- Codes differentiate ground features (boundaries, vegetation types, land use, etc.) and must follow a logical order (e.g., dominant code first when multiple apply).
- Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) provides guidance for identifying features not on OS maps, marking boundaries, and noting no-longer-present features; API guidance is advisory and ground truth overrides if conflicts arise.
- All mapping should clearly indicate actual and inferred boundaries; where boundaries no longer exist, mark with 999 (no longer present).

## Filling in the FAB (Section 6.1.2)
- FABs and 6" maps are compiled into a Field Assessment Booklet; neatness and clarity are critical for later analysis.
- Pages include: series number, ownership details, farmer interactions, physiography, land use, boundaries, and other site-specific observations.
- Ownership and farmer information sections capture contact details, cooperative indicators, and past ownership changes; these data help with future access and outreach.
- Field notes include qualitative observations and any clarifying comments on complex sites.

## Vegetation Recording and Codes (Section 6.2.2 – 6.2.5)
- Plot types and sizes:
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots per square, located in representative land-cover types.
  - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots placed in natural/semi-natural habitats.
  - Linear plots: up to five plots along boundaries, hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides.
- Plot layout and relocation:
  - Permanent markers (metal plates) locate quadrats for repeatability; relocation rules ensure plots can be re-identified across surveys.
  - In changing land uses, relocation procedures emphasize boundary-based placement or new appropriate habitats, with detailed field notes.
- Data collection within plots:
  - Record species present using a standardized list; nested quadrats capture increasing detail, with cover estimates recorded in 5% increments (or 0.5% for precise notes).
  - If a species is not on the list, unlisted species are recorded at the foot of the sheet with their approximate cover.
  - A sketch on the back of the sheet shows plot layout and measurements; bryophytes and lichens are sampled selectively.
- Coding system:
  - Primary codes are essential; secondary codes accompany them where necessary.
  - Alpha codes replace lengthy numeric strings to describe combined features (e.g., boundary types with hedge, fence, etc.).
  - Boundaries must be coded with consistent end-points and explicit deletion of no-longer-present features (code 999).
  - Vegetation cover types include a comprehensive GB-wide taxonomy ( grasses, shrubs, heaths, mires, moorlands, bracken, etc.), with species coding for dominant canopy or ground cover when >25% cover.
  - Species lists cover crops, grasses, forbs, woody plants, sedges, rushes, ferns, and bryophytes; may use combinations for difficult identifications.
- Specific sections cover:
  - Physiography, inland water, coastal features, boundaries, buildings/structures/communications, and other land-use categories.
  - The “Buildings/Structures/Communications” section includes curtilage mapping, urban-rural boundary distinctions, and a color-coded scheme for rapid mapping of built features.
  - Universal codes for mapping long-term updates and non-mapped features.

## Plot Types and Location Rules (Section 6.2.3 – 6.2.5)
- Quadrats:
  - 5 large quadrats (200 m2 each) placed to capture diverse land-cover types; five 4 m2 quadrats nested within larger plots for finer resolution.
  - Permanent marking and relocation rules ensure repeatability.
- Linear plots:
  - Hedge, stream, and roadside plots laid out with a 1 m width from the dominant linear feature; multiple linear plot types must not overlap and must respect minimum distances.
  - Boundary plots are prioritized when present, and plotting is adjusted if hedges or other features change.
- Location and relocation:
  - For 1978 squares, original plots are relocated as closely as possible; if a feature no longer exists, document the change and adjust the plot placement accordingly.
  - When many land-cover types exist, randomization may be used to select plots to avoid bias.
- Species identification guidelines:
  - Species-level identification is standard, but certain easily-confused species may be recorded as acceptable combinations to maintain consistency with historical data.
  - A long list of acceptable species combinations is provided to facilitate consistent data entry when exact identification is challenging.

## Sampling (Section 7)
- Two main freshwater sampling components per square:
  - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE sampling) following a separate handbook.
  - Freshwater biota from standing waters (NELUP sampling for water beetles) with standardized protocols.
- Sampling targets reflect the square’s two key freshwater habitats: lakes/lochs, ponds, wetlands, flushes, and other aquatic features.
- Each square records two primary standing-water samples, with precise labeling for traceability and transport to Merlewood.

## Photography (Section 8)
- Print photography captured for every vegetation plot to document general appearance and location cues.
- Plot numbers are clearly labeled on a board placed at plot edges to align with FABs.

## Procedures Subsequent to Survey (Section 9)
- End-of-day checks recommended: review FABs for omissions and ensure complete coverage before leaving the site.
- Return of FABs and samples to the ITE stations promptly for processing and archival.

## Key Takeaways for Data Support
- The survey emphasizes standardized, codified data collection to enable reliable cross-square comparisons and long-term monitoring.
- A comprehensive coding system for vegetation, land use, boundaries, and built features supports scalable data products and dashboards.
- Permanent markers and relocation protocols enable consistent re-sampling and temporal trend analysis.
- Rich metadata (ownership, physiography, land-use history, and human interactions) enhances data usability for policy, planning, and public communication.
- The data workflow integrates field observations, map-based recording, photographic documentation, and biological sampling into a cohesive data product suitable for analysis and sharing.
