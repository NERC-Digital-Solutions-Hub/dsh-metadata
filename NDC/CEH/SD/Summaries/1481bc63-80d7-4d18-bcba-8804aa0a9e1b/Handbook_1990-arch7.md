# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Overview
- Purpose: update land-use databases, map Britain’s land cover, and provide current datasets for scientific evaluation of ecological systems.
- Approach: two-tier integration of top-down remote sensing with ground-truth field survey; data captured as mapping, recording, quadrats, and sampling.
- Scope: survey 512 squares (512 sites) in 1990, with a mixed design drawing on prior ITE surveys (1977/78, 1984, 1988) and a plan to resurvey to monitor changes in land cover and vegetation.
- Outputs: standardized Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), 1:10,000 maps, detailed vegetation plots, and data coding for GIS-ready analysis.

## Aims and Rationale for GIS
- Standardized data collection and recording to enable reliable cross-site comparisons and temporal change detection.
- Creation of rich, map-based data suitable for GIS visualisation and policy/public dissemination.
- Consistent field recording to reduce observer variation and improve statistical reliability.

## Planning and Sampling Design
- Six teams from six ITE Research Stations, each handling about 85 squares.
- Estimated field time: three days per square; travel time minimized; no overtime (time off in lieu for large overtime accumulations).
- Sampling framework includes large 200 m2 quadrats, smaller nested plots, and multiple linear plot types to capture vegetation and habitat variation.
- Location and relocation rules for squares and plots emphasize systematic relocation when possible and transparent documentation of changes.

## Equipment
- Provided by Merlewood: FABs, aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, project handouts, weatherproof clipboards, pens, survey poles, markers, sampling gear, tape, navigation aids, identity cards.
- Station-provided: site/location maps, pencils, reference books, camera, hand lens, film, first-aid kit, bivy gear, etc.
- Surveyors supply personal gear (clothing, pack).

## General Field Survey Procedure
- On arrival: quick site reconnaissance, assess potential problems, and plan access.
- Seek permission for full square access before starting; select a route enabling thorough examination.
- After recording: review for omissions and ensure clear, well-presented data.

## Permissions
- Legal access and farmer/landowner goodwill are essential; background information gathered via landowner conversations.
- Prior contact via letters; direct calls during visits; permission prioritized to avoid wasted work.
- If permission is refused: abort or relocate parts/square as appropriate; note reasons; maintain ownership/contact records.
- If access is granted but vegetation access is blocked, document and reposition using Section 6.2 guidelines.

## Data Recording (Filling in the FAB)
- The FAB comprises three main elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter in Section 7).
- Mapping uses enlarged 6" maps (1:10,000) with coded data boxes (primary and secondary codes) to annotate features efficiently; alpha codes can represent combinations of numeric codes.
- Codes are organized to reflect logical data order (e.g., dominant code following boundary code, etc.).
- Boundaries must be clearly marked; unchanged boundaries with no ground presence coded 999 (no longer present).
- Minimum mapping units: 1/25 ha; minimum length to map: 20 m.
- Non-vegetation features (e.g., crosses for point features) are recorded as necessary.
- Aerial photograph interpretation (API) may be used to identify features not on OS maps and to update boundaries; API conventions are taught to surveyors.
- FAB completion: pages must be neat; each page must carry the square series number; use pencil when possible; provide comprehensive notes if categories are ambiguous.

### 6.1 Mapping
- Annotate maps with data codes; use alpha-numeric coding to summarize multiple attributes in a single feature.
- Two code types: primary (essential) and secondary (supporting); aim to minimize multiple primary codes unless necessary.

#### 6.1.1 Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API)
- Objectives: identify features not on OS maps, indicate boundaries between semi-natural vegetation types, and update for new developments.
- Conventions: remove non-essential map labels, use dashed lines for API-identified boundaries, cross symbols for isolated features, diamonds to mark no-longer-present boundaries.

#### 6.1.2 Filling in the FAB
- For each square, FABs and 6" maps are integrated into a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB).
- Guidelines: record square number on every page; prefer pencil; map semi-natural units with separate primary codes if needed; use dotted lines to invite further information; when multiple descriptive codes apply, rank by dominant cover.
- Ownership, farmer/landowner information, physiography, and other contextual fields captured in dedicated FAB sections.

## 6.2 Vegetation Recording and Plotting (6.2.x)
### 6.2.1 General
- Re-survey of vegetation to track changes in land cover types; establish new plots as needed; permanent markers placed for future relocation.

### 6.2.2 Method of Recording Vegetation
- A standard form is used to record from plots of varying sizes (200 m2 large quadrats, nested 4 m2, and smaller quadrats).
- List of ~200 common species; for present species, record names and estimate cover in 5% increments (up to 100% within a plot).
- Use X marks for point data (e.g., single occurrences); draft sketches for plot layouts; collect unidentified species for later lab work.
- Detailed guidelines for field identification, inner/outer nested quadrats, and recording order.

### 6.2.3 Plot Types
- Quadrats: five 200 m2 large quadrats; five 4 m2 quadrats within natural/semi-natural vegetation.
- Linear plots: up to five 1 m wide plots along boundaries (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides).
- Location/Relocation rules for quadrats based on prior 1978 data and current land use; relocation uses reference boundaries and nearest land-cover types; if necessary, randomisation is used to select new plots.

### 6.2.4 1978 Rules for Locating Linear Plots
- Hedgerows, roadsides, streamsites: locate 1 m wide plots along dominant vertical feature; if nearest feature is unsuitable, relocate to the nearest permissible feature; detailed figure-based rules guide placement.

### 6.2.5 Guidelines on Species Identification
- Emphasize species-level identification where possible but accept certain combinations (combinations of closely related species) for consistency with prior surveys.
- A defined list of acceptable species combinations is provided to preserve comparability across surveys.
- Recording of bryophytes and lichens with a limited, approved list; some specimens may be collected for later lab verification.

### Species and Codes
- Appendix includes the 200 most frequent species and universal codes for crops, grasses, forbs, woody plants, ferns, mosses, and lichens; codes are used consistently to describe vegetation types, proportions, and age structures.

## 7 Sampling (Freshwater Biota)
- Two types of freshwater biota samples per square:
  - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE sampling; described in a separate handbook).
  - Freshwater biota from standing water (NELUP sampling; water beetles focus; Newcastle University).
- Each square yields two samples from standing waters (vegetated preferred); sample points are mapped (IFE and NELUP) and labeled for transport to Merlewood.

## 8 Photography
- Photograph every vegetation plot using print film; plot numbers to be displayed on a board at plot edge to identify location and marker plate position.

## 9 Procedures Subsequent Survey
- End-of-day checks to ensure no feature is omitted; avoid post-hoc transposition unless necessary due to damage or loss of original maps.
- FABs and samples transported to ITE stations promptly.

## Endnotes and Documentation
- Contact and reference: Colin Barr; ITE Merlewood Research Station; detailed handbooks and background materials accompany the survey.
- Emphasis on data standardization, permanent plotting, and GIS-ready data products to enable robust spatial analyses and long-term monitoring.
