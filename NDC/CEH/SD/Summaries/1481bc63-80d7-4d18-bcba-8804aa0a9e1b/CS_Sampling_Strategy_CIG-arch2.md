# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest development in the ITE Land Classification-based framework used since 1978.
  - Emphasises continuity with past surveys to enable robust time-series analysis of environmental health and policy performance.

- Core concept: stratified ecological sampling
  - Sampling is stratified and random to avoid bias and ensure representativeness across diverse land types.
  - Land Classification (ITE) defines strata by environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to capture ecological variation.
  - Stratified sampling reduces risk of non-representative results that could arise from pure random sampling.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and Countryside Survey framework
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - 1228 centre squares (1 km) classified; 4 surrounding squares per centre classified, yielding 6039 km2 of classified area.
    - Each land class estimated by applying the mean habitat area per square to the total area of the class; 8 squares per class surveyed (256 total).
  - 1984 (Land Use Survey)
    - Framework unchanged, but sample size increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (384 total) to improve national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Extended classification to all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Introduced the first Land Cover Map (from satellite data) linked to the survey.
    - Resulted in a revised classification; some class representations changed, affecting national estimates.
  - 1998–2000 (Revised Classification and CS2000)
    - Acknowledged under-representation of some classes; restructured to allow separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland).
    - Creation of country-unit versions of Land Classes; 40 strata; additional squares added to strengthen representation; upland habitat sampling added as a module.
  - 2007 (Revisions for Wales reporting)
    - Wales-specific reporting required post-devolution; introduced country-unit sub-divisions (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Increased total strata to 45; added 43 Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation (6 squares per Welsh class); two English classes (5e, 15e) remained with 4 squares due to precision considerations.

- Sampling design and outputs
  - Sample frame and allocation
    - GB divided into ITE Land Classes (strata) based on environmental characteristics; country units created for England with Wales and Scotland.
    - Across surveys, the number of squares per class and per country adapted to meet policy and statistical needs.
  - Outputs and estimation
    - National estimates derived by combining per-square habitat data with the area represented by each Land Class.
    - Emphasizes consistency in methodology across time for detecting change and evaluating policy effects.
  - Data management and accessibility
    - Designed to store, manage, and permit reuse of monitoring data; outputs are presented as maps, charts, and reports.
    - Acknowledges the need to maintain comparability across surveys while accommodating classification updates.

- Practical details and references
  - Tables and figures (e.g., CS2000/CS2007 class maps and sampling tables) illustrate class distributions, sampling rates, and country-specific adjustments.
  - Note on national estimates: changing Land Classification affects cross-survey consistency; two approaches exist (latest country-specific classifications vs original 1990 classification) with a preference for the former within surveys and the latter for cross-survey comparability.
  - Appendix and further reading provide a detailed historical timeline of the ITE Land Classification development and its application to Countryside Survey.
