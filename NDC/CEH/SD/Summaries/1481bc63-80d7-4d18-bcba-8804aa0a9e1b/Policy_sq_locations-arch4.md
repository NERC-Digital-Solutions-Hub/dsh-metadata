# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to survey integrity and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Governance and legal context
- CS partners: CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.
- Decisions on exceptional data release are made by CEH on behalf of NERC.
- Legal framework: UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
- CEH/CS partners may provide annual reports on access requests and outcomes.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Preserve future survey viability, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports scientific integrity and policy relevance.

## When and how locations may be released
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence to indicate approximate location.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require CEH-led pre-processing analysis or, in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases, external release under licence with stringent IP-confidentiality equivalence.
- Spatial data within survey squares could also identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
- Licence terms restrict use to the defined project and prohibit misuse to locate squares or assess individual landowners.

## Licence terms and data handling
- Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and accessible only to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite; data must not be repurposed for other organizational responsibilities.
- End-of-project: written destruction confirmation required.
- No release to third parties that could reveal square locations; if in doubt, consult CEH.
- Location data cannot be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have milder IP-protection requirements than six-digit releases.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive exact square locations from the data.

## Roles, processes, and support
- CEH decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses on behalf of NERC.
- Denied requests follow statutory Act/Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides annual reporting on applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; cross-organisational requests assessed case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH early; CEH may assist with defining requirements or providing support, potentially with collaboration or payment.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Establish clear governance for sensitive location data, including licensing, provenance, and access controls.
- Balance public data utility with safeguarding sampling integrity and landowner relationships.
- Plan for secure data lifecycle management: restricted access, temporary licensing, and mandatory destruction.
- Leverage pre-processing and data-curation steps to avoid unnecessary disclosure while enabling useful analyses.
- Coordinate with CEH/NERC and understand statutory duties when handling requests for restricted spatial data.

## Key takeaways
- Location data for CS squares is confidential to protect sampling and landowner cooperation; release is tightly controlled.
- Approximate (four-digit) releases are possible under licence; precise (six-digit) releases require exceptional justification and strong confidentiality safeguards.
- All data releases are governed by formal licences, rigorous handling requirements, and post-project destruction obligations.
- Early engagement with CEH is strongly recommended to navigate data needs, governance, and potential approval pathways.
