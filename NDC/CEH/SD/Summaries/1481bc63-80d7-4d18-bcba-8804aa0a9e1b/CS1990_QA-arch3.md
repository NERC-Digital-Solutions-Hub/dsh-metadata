# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- The document reports on quality assurance (QA) conducted for the 1990 Countryside Survey, presenting scope, results, and recommendations to improve future survey accuracy and confidence in statistics.

## Aims of the QA

- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey and assess changes in statistics.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, season, plot location, data type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- Relate QA findings to previous ITE survey work.
- Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence for future surveys.

## QA Design and Methods

- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: limited to 21 original squares; used original survey sketch maps for plot relocation; involved two independent assessors.
  - 1991: expanded to 1 km squares; included photographs of plots to aid relocation; same assessors revisited many plots.
- Plot types assessed (six types): X-quadrats (200 m2), Y-plots (4 m2), road verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries; plus an additional approach to locate buried plates marking quadrats.
- In 1991, each 1 km square included 28 of the 32 terrain classes; one quarter of each square was resurveyed to include all plot types.
- Annotations and method modifications tested:
  - Use of photographs (improved relocation accuracy).
  - Metal plates to mark quadrats.
  - Photographs annotated by surveyors to link to plots.
- Data products included: plot relocation accuracy, species concordance across time (T1 vs T2), cover estimates for selected species, and land-use/boundary mapping codes.

## Key Findings: Data Quality and Concordance

- Overall species agreement between time points:
  - Autumn 1990 QA indicated ~60.9% agreement for species lists across all plots.
  - Full 1990 QA suggested an initial efficiency of recording around 58–74%, depending on how accuracy was calculated and which variations were excluded.
  - When seasonality and year-to-year climatic differences were accounted for, some comparisons suggested higher real-verse-change signals, though substantial variation remained.
- 1991 QA (with photographs and same-plot revisits) showed a notable increase in detected species per plot (average from ~20.2 in 1990 to ~23.4 in 1991; highly significant when combining data across all plots).
- Seasonality effects:
  - Seasonal timing (summer vs autumn) and drought conditions markedly affected species detectability, leading to apparent changes that may not reflect true ecological change.
  - Recommendations emphasize conducting QA in the same year as the original survey to reduce seasonal biases.
- Plot relocation and data capture:
  - Relocation accuracy varied by plot type and land class; X plots easiest to relocate, Y plots most difficult.
  - Use of photographs and metal plates substantially improved plot relocation success; plate-based relocation remained time-consuming in unenclosed upland areas.
- Impact of observer and data handling:
  - Misidentifications and over- or under-recording of species were common sources of variation, particularly for grasses and bryophytes.
  - There was substantial variation due to mis-location, mis-orientation, and seasonal changes in species presence.

## Plot Types, Land Classes and Mapping

- Plot-type performance:
  - X plots: best relocation accuracy; Y plots most challenging; road verges and hedges intermediate.
  - Enclosed vs unenclosed areas showed differing levels of relocation precision and interpretive difficulty.
- Land-class effects:
  - Lowland arable (LC) showed notably lower recording accuracy compared with other land classes; upland (UP) and other classes performed better.
  - DECORANA analyses indicate directional axis shifts across time, with upland moorlands and bogs showing distinctive, stable vegetation gradients less affected by recent agricultural changes.
- Mapping and codes:
  - Primary land-use codes were generally reliable (high concordance, around 88–95% in some comparisons).
  - Boundary codes and descriptive qualifiers showed more variation, with notable confusion around certain hedge and hedge-coverage codes.
  - Recommendations call for expanding primary land-use codes, simplifying mapping schemes, and restricting use of complex qualifiers to reduce misinterpretation.
  - A recommendation to record only the two most prevalent species for mapping to improve reproducibility.

## Species Cover and Taxa

- Cover estimates:
  - Visual cover estimates were generally variable between surveys, with some significant differences for select species (notably grasses and certain forbs) across years.
  - Bryophytes and some grasses contributed to most of the observed discrepancies; recommendations include targeted Bryophyte-focused training and inclusion of additional species for habitat-specific surveys.
- Species groups and frequency:
  - Analyses of frequency changes for representative species groups largely did not show significant differences in cumulative frequency across the two time points, though some individual species showed changes likely due to climate or management shifts.
  - Some apparent changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana communis) likely reflect true population changes or year-to-year climatic effects.

## Ecological Gradient and Data Synthesis

- DECORANA analyses were used to examine ecological gradients (axis 1) across plot types and land classes.
  - Overall axis shifts from 1990 to 1991 were in the same direction across plot types, suggesting some consistency with long-term ecological trends, but the magnitude varied and was not always statistically significant given sample size.
  - Combining data from multiple time periods showed broader shifts consistent with changes observed in earlier ECOLUC work, with year-to-year variability more pronounced in marginal lands.
- Plot-level axis shifts:
  - Median shifts varied by plot type, often indicating a tendency toward certain ecological changes (e.g., towards lowland or shade-tolerant gradients) depending on land class and plot type.

## Recommendations (Key Points)

- Data collection and QA practices:
  - QA should be conducted in the same year as the original survey to minimize seasonal effects.
  - Use photographs to aid plot relocation and annotate photographs with plot context.
  - Use metal marker plates for plots where feasible, especially in enclosed land; recognize relocation time costs in upland unenclosed areas.
  - Improve quadrat positioning techniques, particularly for small Y plots; ensure clear documentation of plot location and orientation (prefer SE corner for Y plots; orient along N-S).
  - Annotate photographs with contextual features to aid future reloca­tion.
- Training and field methods:
  - Expand training on bryophytes and grasses; create reference samples and habitat information for species identification.
  - Provide dedicated bryophyte training materials and consider expanding allowable bryophyte lists where appropriate.
  - Improve field handbooks to provide explicit guidance on tree/shrub cover recording and to standardize usage of tree/shrub cover data in analyses.
- Land-use and mapping:
  - Increase the number of primary land-use codes; introduce simple, unambiguous dichotomous codes.
  - Distinguish lowland rush pasture and other distinct vegetation types (e.g., lowland heath, wet heath) more clearly in primary codes.
  - Sub-divide upland grassland codes to reflect degrees of improvement and disturbance.
  - Limit use and interpretation of complex qualifiers; emphasize recording the dominant vegetation units and the most prevalent species to improve reproducibility.
- Plot types and data handling:
  - Define 4 m2 Y plots with a standardized measurement approach (tape-based, fixed orientation).
  - For relocated plots, keep consistent reference points and ensure exact relocation to minimize mis-location errors.
  - Consider restricting QA to a smaller, representative sample of squares when resources are limited, with a plan for full QA in future cycles.
- Data governance and openness:
  - Ensure clear procedures for metadata, data provenance, and versioning; address barriers to sharing data where appropriate.
  - Maintain open, well-documented data management standards from the source to dissemination.

## Practical Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- QA is essential to understand and quantify observer, seasonal, and methodological variation in environmental monitoring data.
- Photographic documentation and explicit location markers markedly improve repeatability and data quality, suggesting cost-benefit considerations for large-scale monitoring programs.
- Standardization of land-use coding, plot relocation practices, and cover estimation protocols improves comparability across years and surveys.
- Training emphasis should align with the most error-prone taxa and with the most ambiguous mapping codes to reduce major sources of variation.
- When designing monitoring frameworks, plan QA timing, data provenance, and harmonized metadata from the outset to support robust change statistics and policy-relevant conclusions.
