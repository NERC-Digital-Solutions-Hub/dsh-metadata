# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Overview
  - Aims to maximise utility of CS spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners include CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for future Surveys’ scientific integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission to survey.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled under UK FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- When locations may be released and at what precision
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) can be released under licence to show which grid squares contain CS squares.
  - Six-digit grid references (more precise) are only considered in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may preprocess analyses to avoid release, or external licence may be granted if IP/data confidentiality is higher or equal to CS data.
  - Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

- Data tiers and licensing
  - Four-digit grid references: released under licence with specific use limitations; intended use does not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria.
  - Six-digit grid references: released under licence only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; licenses include strict confidentiality and use controls.
  - Spatial data within squares: released under same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- License terms and responsibilities
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
  - Data must not be shared with third parties in ways that could compromise square locations; not used to plan visits or assess landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to prove project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the highest IP confidentiality criteria.
  - A clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from released data.

- Roles and practical process
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences signed by an authorised representative.
  - CEH will support pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes for CS partners; requests from external organisations are case-by-case.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications and decisions.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

- Practical guidance for GIS work
  - Use four-digit grid reference data when possible to balance utility and confidentiality.
  - Seek CEH pre-processing to avoid needing precise locations.
  - If precise location data are essential, prepare for a stringent exceptional access process and ensure compliance with licensing terms.
