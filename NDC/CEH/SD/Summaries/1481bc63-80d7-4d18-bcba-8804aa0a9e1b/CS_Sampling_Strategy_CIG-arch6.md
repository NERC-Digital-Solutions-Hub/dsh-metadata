# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the development and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey field work from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes the importance of stratified, random sampling to ensure representative national and regional estimates of habitats and land use.

## Key concepts
- Stratification: dividing land into discrete strata (land classes) to reduce sampling bias and capture ecological variation.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) underpin land classes used to stratify GB for surveys.
- Link between sampling and national estimates: estimates are derived by combining per-square habitat data with the distribution/area of each land class.

## Evolution timeline and main developments
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey):
  - 32 Land Classes created from 1 km squares (center of 15x15 km grid) using Indicator Species Analysis.
  - 8 squares surveyed per class (total 256); national estimates based on mean habitat area per square within each class.
- 1984 (2nd Field Survey):
  - Survey expanded to 12 squares per class (total 384); still used the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey):
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares (508 squares surveyed).
  - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; urban and sea corrections added.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification & 4th Field Survey):
  - Classification expanded to 40 classes; separate reporting for Scotland introduced.
  - 569 squares surveyed; national estimates updated accordingly.
- 2000 (CS2000 adjustments):
  - Separate country estimates implemented (England with Wales and Scotland) by subdividing classes and adding squares to ensure adequate representation of each class within each country.
  - Wales given additional sampling and class sub-divisions to support Wales-only reporting.
  - Upland habitat module added to improve estimates for uplands in England and Wales.
- 2007 (CS2007 adjustments):
  - Wales-only reporting further refined with new country-unit classes (5 new Welsh sub-classes) and 43 additional Welsh squares.
  - England adjustments made to maintain representation after Welsh additions; Wales maintains minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - Introduction of Wales- and England-specific class maps; sample distributions summarized in Table 3 and figures.

## Sampling design and implementation details
- Sample size strategy
  - 1978: 8 squares per Land Class (256 total) to balance coverage and effort.
  1984: 12 squares per class (384 total).
  1990: 508 squares total; all GB squares classified; additional squares allocated to larger classes.
  2000: framework adjusted to produce country-level estimates; 40 strata (later 45 with Welsh subdivisions).
  2007: expanded to 45 strata; Wales subdivisions increased to ensure robust Wales-only reporting.
- Allocation and representation
  - Squares chosen to be representative of each Land Class’s area and characteristics.
  - Adjustments over time to maintain balanced representation across England, Scotland, and Wales and to support country-specific environmental policies.
- Outputs and data products
  - Data collected included habitat areas and land-use features; results used to generate national and country-specific estimates.
  - Outputs reported in CS1990 main report, CS2000 publications, and CS2007 UK results, with methodological notes on estimation and classification changes.

## Country-specific estimates and upland module
- Separate country estimates
  - Implemented to enable England with Wales and Scotland-only reporting, reflecting policy and legislative needs.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; adjustments made to ensure adequate sampling per country and class.
- Uplands module (CS2000)
  - Added 30 squares targeting upland and marginal upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - Improves statistical accuracy of upland habitat estimates within country reports.
- Isle of Man
  - Previous Isle of Man samples replaced by new squares in England for country-unit reporting.
- Welsh adjustments (CS2007)
  - Welsh samples increased significantly to support Wales-only reporting; Welsh class subdivisions introduced (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Wales now has more intensive sampling relative to other countries to support robust Wales-specific analyses.

## National estimates and consistency considerations
- Creation of national estimates depends on the chosen Land Classification for the survey period.
- Changing the basic Land Classification affects the consistency of stock estimates; CS2007 notes prefer using the latest country-specific classification for internal consistency, while recognizing cross-survey comparability challenges.
- Table 4 (Original vs. Current Classifications) illustrates how sample sizes per class have evolved across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
