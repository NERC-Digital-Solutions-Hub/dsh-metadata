## Overview and purpose for monitoring frameworks

- Provides a standardized set of landscape point features for environmental monitoring and assessment in Great Britain.
- Enables analysis of landscape composition, land use structures, vegetation, and related attributes at a 1km-square scale.
- Supports informing policy scrutiny, evaluation, and decision-making by supplying coded attributes and crosswalks to classification schemes.

## Data scope, sampling design and coverage

- Geography: Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales).
- Temporal coverage: Year 1990 (baseline for landscape features).
- Sampling design: 451 one-kilometre squares surveyed to capture landscape features across the region.

## Data provenance, licensing, and usage requirements

- Data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Usage must include explicit acknowledgment: “Countryside Survey data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.”
- Acknowledgement and copyright statements apply to all copies, publications, reports, and presentations.
- References and methodologies are provided to support interpretation and cross-walking with other classifications (ITE Land Classification 1981/1996/2007, Biodiversity Broad Habitat classification, etc.).

## Metadata, interoperability, and governance considerations

- Rich set of coded attributes facilitating crosswalks to established classifications (ITE Land Classification, habitat classifications, etc.).
- Documentation and publications cited for interpretation guidelines and methodological context.
- Data formatting may require transformation for use in dashboards or reports; clear metadata and crosswalk references exist to support this.
- Governance considerations include data sharing constraints and the need to maintain provenance and attribution in outputs.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks

- Acts as a baseline data source for landscape features, land-use structure, vegetation attributes, and environmental classifications.
- Facilitates trend analysis and policy evaluation when used alongside other years or complementary datasets.
- Requires careful handling of codes and metadata to ensure consistent interpretation across frameworks and over time.

## Publications and references

- Countryside Survey Website: overview and methodologies.
- ITE Merlewood Land Classification of Great Britain (1996) and ITE Land Classification of Great Britain 2007 (dataset reference).

## Usage notes and practical implications for monitoring teams

- Ensure proper acknowledgment of Countryside Survey data in all outputs.
- Use provided theme, attribute, species, and land-class fields with corresponding crosswalks for alignment with monitoring indicators.
- Leverage the environmental zone description (EZ_DESC_07) and LC07 classifications to contextualize landscape features within policy-relevant frameworks.
- Consult the cited references for methodological guidance and to interpret classification codes accurately.
