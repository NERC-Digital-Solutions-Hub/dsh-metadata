# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007; revised 2011) documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used to survey Countryside Survey field data across Britain.
- The methodology is tightly linked to a long historical development (from 1978) and is essential for understanding how time-series change is detected and estimated.

## Core aims and approach

- Use a stratified, random sampling framework to ensure samples are representative and minimize bias.
- Employ the ITE Land Classification as the primary stratification system to reflect ecological differentiation across the country.
- Sample units are 1 km squares, selected within classified strata to enable robust national, regional, and country-specific estimates.
- Early surveys balanced the need for representativeness with practical field constraints by sampling a fixed number of squares per land class (e.g., eight per class in CS1978).

## The ITE Land Classification: basis and evolution

- Origin: Developed in the 1970s from vegetation quadrats and environmental attributes, using an Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) approach to group areas by similar environmental characteristics.
- 1978 (Initial survey): 32 Land Classes derived from 1 km squares, with central squares classified and four surrounding squares assigned to classes; eight samples per class (256 total) for national habitat-area estimates.
- 1984: Land Classification used for a second GB survey with 12 squares per class (384 total); showed change statistics between 1978 and 1984.
- 1990: Land Classification expanded to classify all GB squares (the “All Squares” approach); 508 squares surveyed; first linkage with a Land Cover Map from satellite data; national estimates recalculated using the revised classification.
- 1990s: Class maps and simulations explored to extend classification to every square; the best approaches produced a modified 40-class framework for regional/local estimates, while preserving core characteristics of the original classifications.
- 2000: CS2000 introduced country-unit reporting (England with Wales, and Scotland) to meet distinct policy needs; Land Classes subdivided into country-unit variants (total 40 strata after adjustments) and additional squares allocated to ensure representation of new classes; upland habitat module added to improve upland estimates.
- 2007: CS2007 added Wales-only reporting needs; five new Welsh country-unit classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45; 43 more Welsh squares added to ensure adequate Welsh representation; some English classes retained with smaller sample counts; Wales received targeted sampling enhancements.

## Sampling framework by survey year

- CS1978 (Initial Land Classification & field survey)
  - 32 land classes; 1228 central squares classified with ISA; total classification extended to 6039 km squares including surrounding squares.
  - 256 squares surveyed (8 per class).
  - National estimates computed as mean habitat per square within each Land Class multiplied by the Land Class area.
- CS1984 (2nd field survey)
  - 12 squares per class (384 total); used CS1978 classification baseline.
- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd field survey)
  - Land Classification updated to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Recorded features from 1984 survey plus replications; first linkage to a Land Cover Map of GB.
  - Results published in CS1990 main report (1993).
- CS2000 (Developments for broader coverage and country-specific estimates)
  - Revisions to enable England & Wales and Scotland reporting; Land Classes subdivided into country-unit variants; class aggregation used where necessary; 19 additional squares added to ensure adequate representation, plus extra to balance between England and Wales.
  - An uplands module was added to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - Summary table (Table 2) shows the distribution and sampling rates across land classes and the three political units.
- CS2007 (Welsh-only reporting and further refinements)
  - Wales required more robust Wales-only estimates after devolution; added five Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - 43 additional Welsh squares surveyed; some English classes retained with smaller sample counts; revised England-Wales-Scotland maps (Figure 6) and CS2007 sample squares map (Figure 7) provided.
  - Table 3 outlines the 2007 sampling numbers by class and country.

## Country-unit estimates and upland module

- Adjustments to generate country-specific estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland) by subdividing Land Classes into country units and aggregating rump classes within each country when necessary, creating 40 strata (and later 45 with Wales-specific subdivisions).
- Additional squares ensure adequate representation of all new classes in each country unit (minimums per class).
- Wales-specific sub-divisions were implemented for Wales-dominant Land Class 17 (and related adjustments) to improve Wales reporting.
- An upland module in CS2000 supplied improved statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Data handling, outputs, and consistency considerations

- National estimates are derived by combining per-square habitat characteristics with the area/size of each Land Class, using the relevant Land Classification.
- The report notes that changing the Land Classification used for national estimates can affect consistency across surveys; the preferred approach for cross-survey consistency is to use the latest classification for country/unit estimates, while acknowledging potential cross-survey comparability issues.
- Table 4 (Original 1990 Land Classification) illustrates how sample sizes would differ under the original classification, highlighting the impact of classification changes on time-series comparability.

## Key takeaways for data-focused use

- The Countryside Survey relies on a rigorously defined, multi-stage sampling strategy anchored in a long-running ITE Land Classification.
- Stratified random sampling within 1 km squares, guided by land-class geography, enables robust national and country-level habitat and land-use estimates across decades.
- Methodological evolution (1978–2007) consistently aimed to improve country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and to account for upland habitats, while balancing practical sampling constraints.
- Users should be mindful of classification changes when comparing estimates across survey years, with preference given to the latest classification for current country-unit reporting.
