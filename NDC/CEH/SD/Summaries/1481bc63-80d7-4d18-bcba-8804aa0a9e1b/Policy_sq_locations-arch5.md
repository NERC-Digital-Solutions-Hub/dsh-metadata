# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- This policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to location data; other CS data may be publicly available.

## CS partners (current)

- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential

- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environment, and landowner permission for future surveys.
- Confidentiality supports continued ability to inform environmental policy.

- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels

- Access allows users to determine if survey squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence when approximate location suffices.
- Six-digit grid references may be released only if precise location data are essential; CEH can perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing locations.
- In VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, location information may be released externally under licence if the requester demonstrates, in legal terms, that their data/models require equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) can indirectly identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- Licence terms include restrictions to prevent attempts to identify exact square locations.

## Specific licence conditions

- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite, tied to specific projects, and data must not be retained for unrelated organizational responsibilities.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- Data or derived information must not be shared with third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan or execute visits to CS squares, nor to check individual landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with less stringent IP confidentiality requirements.
- A clause prohibits using supplied data to derive precise square locations or to claim such derivations.

## Responsibilities and governance

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data; licences require signing by an authorised senior representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH will strive to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential CS data users are strongly encouraged to consult with CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy (CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid; terms negotiated case-by-case).

## Implications for Data Stewards

- Establishes strict access controls and licensing workflows for sensitive location data.
- Defines roles: CEH as licensing authority; NERC representation via CEH; need for secure storage, finite licences, and post-project destruction verification.
- Requires documentation of release decisions, justification, and annual reporting for transparency.
- Highlights the importance of pre-processing to minimize disclosure risk and the use of four-digit or higher-level location data when appropriate.
- Emphasizes governance around data confidentiality, IP considerations, and ensuring releases do not enable visits or landowner monitoring.
- Recommends early consultation with CEH to align project requirements with confidentiality safeguards.
