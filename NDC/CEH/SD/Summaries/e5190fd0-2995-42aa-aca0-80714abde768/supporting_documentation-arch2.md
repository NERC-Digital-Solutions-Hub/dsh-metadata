# Public perceptions of tidal energy: can you predict social acceptability across coastal communities?

## Objective and scope
- Investigates public perceptions and attitudes toward tidal energy in the UK, focusing on the Bristol Channel area due to its high tidal energy potential.
- Tests whether national coastal typologies (MMO typology) can predict local acceptability of tidal energy developments.
- Compares three spatially distinct case-study sites to assess variation in attitudes by location and by demographics.
- Aims to understand drivers of perception, including place attachment and environmental/social values.

## Study setting and sample
- Case-study sites: Taw Torridge estuary (northern Devon), Minehead/Watchet (Somerset), and Weston-super-Mare/Burnham-on-Sea (Somerset).
- Area chosen because of documented tidal energy potential and to enable cross-site comparisons.
- Survey targets residents aged 18+ in coastal areas with tidal energy potential; designed to test location- and demographic-related differences in views.

## Data collection and instruments
- Method: face-to-face survey conducted in March–April 2018.
- Foundations: builds on offshore wind research showing demographic factors influence responses; acknowledges place attachment as a mediator of response to energy developments.
- Sections:
  - Part 1: Use and perceptions of the local coast, evaluating engagement in coastal activities and the importance of various environmental features (marine mammals, birds, fish, beaches, habitats, peace, and views).
  - Part 2: Attitudes toward tidal energy, self-rated knowledge, willingness to support/oppose, and an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) exercise weighing four tidal-energy characteristics (local environmental impact, local job creation, reliability, cost of energy).
  - Part 3: Reactions to hypothetical local tidal-energy developments and likelihood of support or opposition; related actions if opposed or supported (questions 13–16).
  - Part 4: Ownership and financing preferences for tidal-current developments (who initiates/owns, willingness to invest, and influence of financial return vs broader benefits).
  - Part 5: Demographics and household composition; engagement in public consultation activities; openness to follow-up volunteering (photography project).
- Recruitment and administration notes emphasize consistent data collection, randomization of question order where possible, and the recording of street and locality details.

## The MMO coastal typology and its empirical testing
- The study incorporates four MMO typology classes to examine whether coastal community types correlate with acceptability of tidal-energy developments.
- Typology classes used:
  - A1 Coastal retreats: retirement-oriented, less developed resorts
  - B1 Coastal challenges: towns with structural economic shifts
  - C1 Cosmopolitan coast: tourism-based but with deprivation and diversification
  - D2 Coastal fringe: working, stable, industrially influenced towns
- Purpose: empirically evaluate whether typology maps (constructed from census-driven social, economic, and demographic variables) can predict local attitudes toward tidal energy.

## Data analysis methods
- Data reduction and pattern detection:
  - Exploratory Factor Analysis (STATA/SE 12) using polychoric correlations to handle categorical/non-normal data.
  - Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure and Oblimin oblique rotation to allow correlations among factors.
- Preference weighting:
  - Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) weights calculated with an eigenvalue method in R.
  - Weights aggregated across respondents using geometric mean.
- Outcome modeling:
  - Logistic regression (STATA/SE 12) to model predictors of opposition to local tidal development.
  - ANOSIM (Primer-E v6) for multivariate analysis of explanatory variables related to opposition, including comparisons across case-study sites and typology groups.
- Objective: identify key drivers of acceptance or opposition and how site and typology influence these patterns.

## Data management, completeness, and sharing
- All data are included in the deposited dataset, excluding surveyor names.
- Data are intended for ongoing monitoring and to support future analyses, enabling data sharing through appropriate portals.
- Ethical approval obtained; study funded under the ADVENT project (valuing energy and nature together), funded by UK Government’s Natural Environment Research Council via UKERC.

## Key constructs and anticipated insights
- Place attachment and landscape value as central determinants of responses to tidal-energy developments.
- Public perceptions shaped by:
  - Perceived local environmental impacts (habitat disturbance, visual/aesthetic changes, noise, etc.)
  - Local economic implications (job creation, economic resilience)
  - Reliability and cost of energy produced
  - Personal familiarity and information about tidal energy
- AHP reveals which attributes (environmental impact, jobs, reliability, cost) respondents deem most important when evaluating tidal-energy proposals.
- Opposition or support is linked to demographic, geographic, and typology-based characteristics, with analyses designed to reveal cross-site differences.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy performance
- Demonstrates a structured approach to monitoring social acceptability of environmental energy policies in a consistent, comparative format.
- Produces data that can be integrated with ecological and economic indicators for holistic environmental governance assessment over time.
- Addresses two monitoring challenges: increasing the value of datasets by combining with related data, and facilitating broader access to underlying data for transparency and scrutiny.

## Public engagement and follow-up
- Includes a volunteering component offering participants an opportunity to contribute photographs and engage in a follow-up interview, with a £25 voucher as an incentive.
- Provides channels for questions and data inquiries, with ethical considerations and withdrawal rights clearly stated.
