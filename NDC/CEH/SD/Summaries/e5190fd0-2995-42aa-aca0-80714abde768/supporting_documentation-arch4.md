# Public perceptions of tidal energy: can you predict social acceptability across coastal communities?

- Overview
  - Examines public perceptions of tidal energy along the Bristol Channel (largest UK tidal energy potential) using three case-study sites in North Devon and Somerset: Taw Torridge estuary; Minehead/Watchet; Weston-super-Mare/Burnham-on-Sea.
  - Tests whether coastal community typologies (MMO typology) derived from social, economic, and demographic variables can predict local acceptance of tidal energy.
  - Addresses how attitudes to tidal energy are shaped by place attachment, environmental values, and perceived benefits/risks.

- Data sources and governance
  - Data collected via face-to-face survey in March–April 2018, with adults living in coastal Somerset and Devon.
  - Anonymity and voluntary participation emphasized; ethical approval obtained; dataset deposited with the research team (excluding surveyor names).
  - Researchers: Plymouth Marine Laboratory; data collection by Marketing Means (Devon) for the ADVENT project funded by UK Government via UK Energy Research Centre.

- Case study framework and typology
  - Uses MMO coastal typology classes to categorize communities for analysis:
    - A1 Coastal retreats: Silver (retirement areas in small resorts)
    - B1 Coastal challenges: Structural shifters (towns with economic restructuring)
    - C1 Cosmopolitan coast: Reinventing resorts (tourist economies with deprivation but diversification)
    - D2 Coastal fringe: Working hard (urban-industrial-adjacent towns)
  - Case-study sites mapped to these typologies to explore variation in acceptability by location and typology.

- Survey content and measures
  - Part 1: Use and perceptions of coastal areas
    - Assesses frequency of coastal recreation, place importance (mammals, birds, fish, beaches, habitats, tranquillity, view), and factors in choosing where to live (e.g., friends/family, culture, community involvement, landscapes, wildlife, outdoor recreation).
  - Part 2: Tidal energy knowledge and attitudes
    - Self-rated knowledge of tidal energy; agreement with statements on renewables, national leadership in tidal research, government investment, and perceived challenges/limits of tidal energy.
    - Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) exercise to weight four tidal-energy characteristics:
      - Local environmental impact
      - Local job creation
      - Reliability
      - Cost of energy
  - Part 3: Tidal energy developments in respondents’ area
    - Reaction to possible local tidal-energy development; follow-up questions guide whether to skip to later sections or continue with opinion-based actions.
    - If opposing, questions about potential actions (public consultations, comments, protests, contacting developers, media, petitions).
    - If supporting, questions about the extent of similar actions.
  - Part 4: Ownership and financing
    - Likelihood to support or invest in tidal-current developments owned by UK Government, local council, large energy company, turbine manufacturer, or local community.
    - Capabilities/constraints on investment (affordability, preferred incentives, influence of friends/family, risk vs return, preference for other renewables).
  - Part 5: About you and your household
    - Demographics (residency duration, gender, age, household composition, employment, income bands, qualifications) and past involvement in community projects; frequency of participation in public consultations, planning comments, demonstrations, letters to media, petitions.

- Data analysis approach
  - Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) with polychoric correlations to handle ordinal/categorical data; Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) adequacy check; Oblimin rotation to allow correlated factors.
  - Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) weights computed via eigenvalue method and aggregated with geometric mean to reflect individual priority weights.
  - Logistic regression to model factors associated with opposition to local tidal development.
  - ANOSIM (multivariate analysis) to assess differences in explanatory variables by case study site and typology.

- Objectives and purpose
  - To identify key drivers of public perceptions and opposition/s support for tidal energy.
  - To determine whether social, economic, and environmental variables can predict which communities are more or less amenable to tidal developments.
  - To inform marine planning, stakeholder engagement, and policy discussions by mapping attitudes onto community typologies and place-attachment constructs.

- Relevance for data governance and practice (Data Leaders)
  - Demonstrates an integrated data workflow combining attitudinal surveys, place-attachment measures, and decision-analytic weighting (AHP) to inform energy planning.
  - Illustrates handling of ordinal data with appropriate techniques (polychoric correlations; non-parametric considerations implicit in EFA and AHP).
  - Highlights the value of linking community typologies with survey data to predict acceptability and tailor engagement strategies.
  - Emphasizes data provenance, ethical considerations, and completeness (deposited dataset with exceptions clearly noted).
  - Provides a replicable framework for assessing public acceptability of energy projects across regions, useful for data-led governance and strategic planning.
