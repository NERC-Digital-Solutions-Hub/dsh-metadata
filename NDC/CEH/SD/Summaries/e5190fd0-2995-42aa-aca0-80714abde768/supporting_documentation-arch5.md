Public perceptions of tidal energy: can you predict social acceptability across coastal communities?

- Scope and purpose
  - Investigates public perceptions of tidal energy across three coastal case study areas bordering the Bristol Channel (Taw Torridge estuary; Minehead/Watchet; Weston-super-Mare/Burnham-on-Sea) to predict variations in acceptability by location and demographics.
  - Tests applicability of the MMO coastal typology (A1, B1, C1, D2) for predicting local receptiveness to tidal energy.

- Data collection context and sites
  - Data collected via face-to-face surveys with the general public in March–April 2018.
  - Case study sites chosen to be spatially distinct for comparative analysis.
  - Typology integration: four MMO classes represented to examine whether maps based on census variables can indicate likelihood of support for tidal energy.

- Data collection instrument and variables
  - Structured questionnaire covering:
    - Part 1: Use and perceptions of the local coast, place attachment, and importance of coastal environment features (marine mammals, birds, fish, beaches, habitats, peace, and views).
    - Part 2: Attitudes toward tidal energy, self-rated knowledge, and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) exercise comparing four tidal-energy characteristics: Local Environmental Impact, Local Job Creation, Reliability, and Cost of Energy.
    - Part 3: Reactions to hypothetical tidal developments and potential opposition/support, plus decision pathways based on ownership and local context.
    - Part 4: Ownership and financing preferences for tidal energy developments, including willingness to invest and trusted ownership actors.
    - Part 5: Demographics and household composition; prior investments in local community projects; engagement in public consultations.
  - Data types: ordinal (Likert scales), categorical, binary, and paired comparisons (AHP).

- Data management, provenance, and ethics
  - Collected by Plymouth Marine Laboratory; survey company Marketing Means facilitated data collection.
  - Anonymity and voluntary participation emphasized; consent obtained.
  - Ethical approval: University of Plymouth Faculty of Health and Human Sciences and Schools of Medicine and Dentistry Research Ethics Committee.
  - Data completeness: All data are included in the deposited dataset except surveyor names (maintained by the survey company for internal use).
  - Data provenance: Full questionnaire script and field procedures documented; survey instructions include routing and randomization considerations.

- Data processing and analysis
  - Data analysis approaches:
    - Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFAs) using STATA/SE 12 with polychoric correlations, KMO adequacy checks, and Oblimin rotation to identify patterns in place-attachment and environmental-attribute responses.
    - Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) weights computed via eigenvalue methods in R; weights aggregated with geometric means for each respondent.
    - Logistic regression (STATA) to model predictors of opposition to local tidal development.
    - Multivariate analysis (ANOSIM in Primer-E v6) to explore explanatory-variable patterns related to opposition across case study sites and typologies.
  - Purpose of analysis: understand drivers of place attachment and identify factors most predictive of support or opposition to tidal energy.

- Data availability and reuse implications for data stewards
  - Dataset intended for deposit to enable reuse by other researchers, policy makers, and planners.
  - Documentation includes methodological details (survey design, typology integration, statistical approaches) to support replication and secondary analyses.
  - Potential dataset applications: comparative studies of public perception across regions, evaluation of typology effectiveness in predicting acceptability, cross-study validation of attitudes toward renewable energy technologies.
  - Considerations for data stewards:
    - Ensure metadata captures site-specific context, typology classifications, and the exact construction of the AHP and EFAs.
    - Maintain versioning of the dataset and any derived analytics (e.g., factor structures, weights, models) to track updates or re-analyses.
    - Include clear provenance (who collected data, data custodians, ethical approvals) and data-use licenses to enable responsible reuse.
    - Maintain alignment with data governance practices for sensitive or contextual variables (e.g., location, demographic details) while preserving participant anonymity.

- Practical notes for data governance and documentation
  - The dataset combines social-science survey data with spatial typology classifications, requiring careful metadata to enable interoperability with other coastal plans and datasets.
  - The study demonstrates a robust approach to integrating qualitative-informed preferences (place attachment, local values) with quantitative decision-analysis methods (AHP, regression, multivariate analyses), which should be reflected in data dictionaries and variable definitions for reuse.
