# Public perceptions of tidal energy: can you predict social acceptability across coastal communities?

- Objective and scope
  - Investigates public perceptions of tidal energy in the UK, focusing on social acceptability across coastal communities.
  - Aims to test whether national coastal typologies (MMO typology) can predict which communities are more or less likely to favour tidal energy developments.
  - Uses three case-study sites along the Bristol Channel (Taw Torridge estuary; Minehead/Watchet; Weston-super-Mare/Burnham-on-Sea) to compare attitudes by location and by demographic characteristics.

- Study setting and sample
  - Case-study sites are spatially distinct to enable comparisons by location.
  - Grounded in the MMO coastal typology (A1 Coastal retreats; B1 Coastal challenges; C1 Cosmopolitan coast; D2 Coastal fringe) to explore potential amenability to energy developments.
  - Data collected via face-to-face survey during March–April 2018 with adults living in coastal Somerset and Devon regions with tidal energy potential.
  - Focuses on general coastal use, place attachments, and views on tidal energy, plus demographic information.

- Data collection: what respondents were asked
  - Part 1: Use and perceptions of the local coast
    - Frequency of activities (e.g., walking, swimming, boating, wildlife watching) and importance of coastal features (marine mammals, birds, fish, beaches, habitats, peace, and views).
    - Place attachment factors shaping living location choices (e.g., natural landscapes, wildlife, outdoor recreation, local culture, family ties, friends nearby).
  - Part 2: Generating electricity using tidal energy
    - Self-rated knowledge of tidal energy and attitudes toward renewables.
    - Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to compare four tidal-energy characteristics: Local Environmental Impact, Local Job Creation, Reliability, and Cost of Energy.
  - Part 3: Hypothetical tidal energy developments in the respondent’s area
    - Reactions to proposed tidal energy developments and potential actions (participation in consultations, commenting on applications, demonstrations, contacting developers, advocacy activities, petitions).
  - Part 4: Ownership and financing of tidal energy developments
    - Likelihood of supporting or investing in tidal current developments owned by different actors (UK Government, local council, large energy company, turbine manufacturer, local community).
    - Extent of investment willingness and influencing factors (financial return, environmental benefits, community impact, social influence, affordability, preference for other renewables).
  - Part 5: About you and your household
    - Residency duration, demographics (gender, age, household composition), employment, income, qualifications, prior investments in community projects, and engagement in public consultation activities.

- Analytical approach and data handling
  - Exploratory Factor Analysis (EF A) in STATA with polychoric correlations to identify patterns in coastal-use and place-attachment data; oblique rotation to allow correlated factors; Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure for sampling adequacy.
  - Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) weights calculated in R using eigenvalue method; weights aggregated per respondent via geometric mean.
  - Logistic regression (STATA) to model how variables contribute to the likelihood of opposing a local tidal development.
  - ANOSIM (Primer-E) for multivariate analysis of explanatory variables related to opposition, comparing case-study sites and typologies.
  - Data completeness: all data included in the deposited dataset except surveyor names; ethics approvals obtained; consent and anonymity maintained; potential volunteers for follow-up photography.

- Key variables and constructs
  - Place attachment: influenced by natural landscapes, wildlife, outdoor recreation, and other local values.
  - Coastal-use patterns: frequency of coastal activities and importance of environmental features.
  -Tidal-energy attributes (AHP): Local Environmental Impact, Local Job Creation, Reliability, Cost of Energy.
  - Attitudes toward tidal energy: perceived informativeness, support/oppose stance toward local developments.
  - Ownership/investment: respondent willingness to support or invest based on owner type and governance structure.
  - Demographics: residence duration, age, gender, income, education, employment, and prior community investments.

- Purpose and potential impact of the analysis
  - To identify correlates of social acceptability for tidal energy and to determine whether coastal typologies reliably predict acceptance.
  - To inform planning, stakeholder engagement, and policy by targeting communities more amenable to tidal development and understanding key drivers of opposition or support.
  - To complement qualitative work in the same areas, providing a broader, data-driven basis for anticipating public responses to tidal-energy projects.

- Data provenance, ethics, and accessibility
  - Conducted by Plymouth Marine Laboratory with data collection contracted to Marketing Means (Devon); analyses and interpretation by the authors.
  - Ethical approval obtained; consent procedures described; data deposited with full completeness except surveyor identities; participants’ responses anonymized.
  - Follow-up opportunity offered for photography-based qualitative insights, with compensation for volunteers.
