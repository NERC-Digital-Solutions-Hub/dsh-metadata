# Public perceptions of tidal energy: can you predict social acceptability across coastal communities?

- A study addressing how public attitudes toward tidal energy vary across coastal communities in the Bristol Channel, with three case study sites: Taw Torridge estuary (North Devon), Minehead/Watchet, and Weston-super-Mare/Burnham-on-Sea. 
- Objective: empirically test whether the MMO coastal typology classes can predict local acceptance of tidal energy and identify key drivers (demographics, place attachment, local environment values) to inform planning and stakeholder engagement.

## Context and aims

- Investigates public perceptions and acceptance of tidal energy to inform policy scrutiny and future decision-making.
- Uses the MMO Coastal Typologies (A1 Coastal retreats; B1 Coastal challenges; C1 Cosmopolitan coast; D2 Coastal fringe) to explore location-based differences in attitudes.
- Aims to determine if social, economic, and demographic maps can predict communities more or less likely to support tidal energy developments.

## Data collection and study design

- Data collected via face-to-face survey with the general public in March–April 2018.
- Participants: adults in coastal Somerset and Devon areas with potential for tidal energy.
- Instrument structure:
  - Part 1: Use and perceptions of the local coast, place attachment, and environmental features at risk from tidal energy.
  - Part 2: Attitudes toward tidal energy, self-perceived informativity, broad views on renewables, and an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank four tidal-energy characteristics: local environmental impact, local job creation, reliability, and cost of energy.
  - Part 3: Reactions to hypothetical tidal-energy developments, including opposition/support and likelihood of various actions.
  - Part 4: Ownership and financing preferences for tidal-energy developments.
  - Part 5: Demographics and household composition.
- Ethical approvals and funding:
  - Conducted for the ADVENT project (Valuation of Energy and Nature Together), funded by the UK Government’s Natural Environment Research Council via the UK Energy Research Centre.
  - Ethical approval from the University of Plymouth; participants informed about anonymity and voluntary participation.
  - Optional follow-up photography interviews offered as a voluntary activity with a voucher incentive.

## Key measures and constructs

- Place attachment and its potential influence on attitude toward tidal developments.
- Importance ratings for local coastal features (marine mammals, birds, fish, beaches, habitats, peace/tranquility, the view).
- Local lifestyle and living-situation determinants (e.g., length of residence, reasons for living near coast, local culture).
- Tidal-energy attitudes (informativeness, optimism/concern about renewables, belief in leadership role of the UK in tidal tech, perceived enabling investment).
- AHP attributes to weight versus each other:
  - Local environmental impact
  - Local job creation
  - Reliability of energy supply
  - Cost of energy
- Behavioral intentions regarding acceptance or opposition to local tidal energy projects and related actions (attending consultations, commenting, demonstrations, contacting developers, writing to media, signing petitions).
- Ownership and investment preferences across potential owners (government, local council, large energy company, turbine manufacturer, local community) and willingness to invest or financially participate.
- Demographic variables (age, gender, income, qualifications, employment status) and household structure.

## Analysis methods

- Exploratory Factor Analysis (STATA) with polychoric correlations to identify patterns in coastal-use and place-attachment variables; assessment of sampling adequacy; oblique rotation to allow factor correlations.
- Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for attribute weighting using eigenvalue method (R) and geometric means to aggregate individual weights.
- Logistic regression to model factors associated with opposition to local tidal development.
- Multivariate analysis of variance using ANOSIM (Primer-E v6) to examine variation in opposition across case sites and typologies.
- Data handling and software: STATA/SE 12 for EFA and logistic regression; R for AHP; Primer-E v6 for ANOSIM.

## Data governance and completeness

- All data included in the deposited dataset except surveyor identifiers.
- Data collected to complement qualitative work, supporting broader understanding of public perceptions of wind and tidal energy.
- Emphasis on transparency and sharing of underlying data to support policy evaluation and replication.

## Key implications for monitoring frameworks

- Identifies concrete, measurable indicators of social acceptability for tidal-energy policy evaluation:
  - Levels of place attachment and local environmental value retention as predictors of acceptance.
  - Demographic and typology-based differences in attitudes to inform location-specific engagement.
  - Relative importance of environmental impact, local employment, reliability, and cost (via AHP) to guide project design and communication strategies.
- Demonstrates a structured, policy-relevant approach to monitoring public sentiment and decision drivers over time.
- Highlights methodological considerations relevant to monitoring frameworks:
  - Use of standardized typologies to classify communities for comparative monitoring.
  - Integration of quantitative preference weighting (AHP) with behavioral intentions and policy-relevant outcomes (opposition/support).
  - Need for robust data governance and metadata practices to enable data reuse and cross-site comparisons.

## Outcomes and references

- The study framework is designed to yield insights into drivers of public acceptability and to test predictions of coastal typologies, informing stakeholder engagement and planning.
- Data and methods draw on a wide literature base (place attachment, public acceptance of renewables, AHP, statistical analyses) and are intended to support future monitoring and decision-support tools for marine energy policy.
