# References for biological half-life database

## Overview
- A comprehensive bibliography compiling studies on biological half-lives and biokinetics of radionuclides across diverse species and ecosystems.
- Serves as the literature foundation for a biological half-life database used in environmental radiology and ecosystem transfer modelling.

## Scope of the references
- Broad taxonomic coverage:
  - Fish (e.g., rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmo trutta; Carassius auratus; others)
  - Invertebrates (e.g., Daphnia magna, Mytilus edulis, Scenedesmus obliquus, Corbicula fluminea)
  - Birds (e.g., mallards, geese)
  - Mammals (e.g., mice, rats, rabbits)
  - Amphibians and reptiles, earthworms, mollusks, and other aquatic and terrestrial organisms
- Environments and pathways:
  - Freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems
  - Waterborne uptake, dietary transfer, sediment interactions, and tissue distribution
  - Depuration/clearance, turnover, and biological half-life in whole organisms and tissues
- Radionuclides and elements (examples from the list):
  - Cs-137, Sr-90, Co-60, Mn-54, Ag-110m, 106Ru, 239Pu, 241Am, 65Zn, 58Co, 131I, 90Sr, 85Sr, 51Cr, 60Co, and others
- Thematic focus:
  - Uptake, retention/depuration, distribution among organs, and factors affecting biokinetics
  - Transfer models and parameters for predicting transfer within food webs and ecosystems
  - Influence of variables such as temperature, body size, diet, chemical form, and environmental conditions

## Key themes and data types
- Biological half-life concepts and kinetics across species
- Mechanistic and empirical data on uptake and excretion
- Tissue-specific distribution patterns and whole-body kinetics
- Water-to-organism and diet-to-organism transfer pathways
- Influence of environmental factors (e.g., temperature, salinity) and organism traits on biokinetics
- Foundational modelling work for constructing dynamic radionuclide transfer models

## Notable patterns in the literature
- Cs-137 and other radiocaesium transfer in fish and invertebrates is extensively studied
- Focus on both aquatic and terrestrial pathways, including trophic transfer
- A mix of experimental studies, field observations, and modelling efforts
- Literature spans multiple languages (English, French, Russian, Japanese), reflecting an international data base

## Relevance to GIS and data products
- Provides parameter values and relationships needed to build spatially explicit radiological risk maps and biokinetic models
- Supports creation of network-based and trophic transfer visualizations across landscapes
- Enables integration of species- and environment-specific biokinetic data into map-based decision support tools for radiological assessment

## Data quality and integration considerations
- Heterogeneity in study design, species, and environmental contexts may require careful harmonization
- Older studies provide foundational data but may need revalidation or updating with contemporary measurements
- Data extraction and standardization are needed to enable consistent GIS-enabled analyses (unit standards, concentration metrics, time scales)

## Endnotes
- The document is a curated reference list underlying a biological half-life database, essential for parameterizing biokinetic models and supporting spatial analyses of radionuclide transfer in ecosystems.
