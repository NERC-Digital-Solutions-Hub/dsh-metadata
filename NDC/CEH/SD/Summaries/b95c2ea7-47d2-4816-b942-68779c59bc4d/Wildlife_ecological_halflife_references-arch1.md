# References for ecological half-life database

- This document is a bibliography of studies on ecological half-lives and transfer dynamics of radiocaesium (primarily Cs-137) and related radionuclides in aquatic and some terrestrial systems, intended to support ecological half-life databases and data-driven analyses.

## Overview of topics
- Long-term declines and turnover of radiocaesium in fish and aquatic biota.
- Sources of variation in post-Chernobyl radiocaesium levels in fish from lakes and other freshwater systems.
- Ecological half-lives of Cs-137 and other radionuclides in various environments (aquatic and terrestrial).
- Uptake and elimination processes of radiocaesium in fish, including size-related and trophic effects.
- Transfer of 90Sr and other radionuclides within freshwater ecosystems.
- Comparisons of real-world (post-Chernobyl) contamination with controlled/experimental inputs.
- Time scales spanning years to decades for radionuclide dynamics.

## Geographical and system coverage
- Europe: United Kingdom (Cumbrian lakes), Norway, Finland, Greece, Croatia, Bohemia (Czech Republic), and other European freshwater systems.
- North America: Savannah River Site (USA).
- Ecosystems studied include freshwater lakes, streams, reservoirs, and arctic freshwater systems.
- Taxa studied include multiple fish species (e.g., brown trout, Arctic char, carp) and other biota (e.g., wild boar in terrestrial contexts).

## Key themes and findings (as reflected by titles)
- Ecological half-lives and turnover rates of radiocaesium in fish and lake/river ecosystems.
- Variation in radiocaesium uptake and elimination related to species, body size, life stage, and trophic level.
- Post-Chernobyl contamination dynamics in freshwater fish across diverse geographic locations.
- Comparative analyses of Cs-137 dynamics in experimental setups versus Chernobyl-impacted natural systems.
- Transfer pathways and accumulation of radiocaesium and 90Sr in aquatic systems.
- Temporal trends indicating long-term persistence and decay patterns of radiocaesium in biota.

## Data implications for analysts
- Provides a broad set of ecological half-life estimates and related transfer data useful for modeling radiocesium behavior in freshwater ecosystems.
- Enables cross-species, cross-size, and cross-trophic-level comparisons to inform predictive models.
- Highlights the importance of local context (species, lake characteristics, geography) for interpreting half-life dynamics.
- Supports evaluation of post-accident (Chernobyl) versus experimental input scenarios in radiocaesium studies.

## Notes on methodology and scope
- Emphasizes field observations, long-term monitoring, and comparative analyses between natural and experimental conditions.
- Covers both aquatic and some terrestrial contexts, with a strong focus on fish and freshwater systems.
- Studies span from 1985 through at least 2013, reflecting a multi-decade research effort into ecological half-lives and radionuclide transfer.
