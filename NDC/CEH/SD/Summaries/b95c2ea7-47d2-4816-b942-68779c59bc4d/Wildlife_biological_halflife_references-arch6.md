# References for biological half-life database

- Overview
  - A comprehensive bibliography compiled to support a biological half-life database, aggregating primary literature on radionuclide bioaccumulation, uptake, depuration, and tissue distribution across ecosystems.

- Scope of data
  - Radionuclides covered include Cs-137, 60 Co, 54 Mn, 110m Ag, 65 Zn, 134 Cs, 137 Cs, 131 I, 90 Sr, plutonium, americium, neptunium, and others.
  - Taxa and subjects span a wide range: freshwater and marine fish (e.g., rainbow trout, carp, goldfish, brown trout), molluscs, crustaceans, earthworms, birds (ducks, geese, mallards), mammals (mice, rats, voles), amphibians, and invertebrates.
  - Environments include freshwater, marine, estuarine systems, with both laboratory and field studies; notable contexts include post-Chernobyl and Fukushima sites.
  - Focus areas include uptake from water, dietary (food chain) transfer, depuration, tissue distribution, and overall biokinetic behavior of radionuclides.

- Data types and variables represented
  - Experimental measurements of biological half-life (half-life within organisms), uptake and clearance rates, and tissue-specific distribution.
  - Transfer parameters and kinetic models describing movement of radionuclides through food chains and into organisms.
  - Factors influencing transfer, such as temperature, organism size, diet, chemical form, and exposure pathway (waterborne vs dietary).
  - Modeling studies and kinetic rate analyses that underpin dynamic transfer charts and biokinetic parameter estimation.

- Sources and formats
  - A mixture of journal articles, PhD theses, conference proceedings, and books.
  - International scope, including sources in French, Russian, Japanese, German, and English; covers historical and more recent work (spanning several decades).

- Data integration considerations for the database
  - The data require standardization of radionuclide identifiers, units, and taxonomic nomenclature.
  - Key parameters to capture include biological half-life, uptake/depuration rate constants, and tissue distribution metrics.
  - Experimental context (temperature, exposure route, life stage, body size) should be recorded to support comparability and model parameterization.

- Uses for data support work
  - Source material for extracting biokinetic parameters to populate a centralized, searchable database.
  - Supports development of biokinetic models for internal dose assessment and environmental risk evaluation.
  - Provides a foundation for cross-species and cross-environment comparisons and for highlighting data gaps.

- Challenges and considerations
  - Heterogeneity in data formats, units, and reporting standards across older theses and non-English sources.
  - Gaps in geographic, taxonomic, and exposure-context coverage that may affect model generalizability.
  - Variability in measurement techniques and experimental conditions requiring careful QA during data integration.
