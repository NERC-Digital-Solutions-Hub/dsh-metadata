# References for ecological half-life database

## Scope and purpose
- Bibliographic compilation of studies on ecological half-lives and turnover of radiocaesium (Cs-137) and related radionuclides (e.g., 90Sr) in aquatic and some terrestrial systems, intended to inform an ecological half-life database.

## Geographic and temporal coverage
- Regions studied include: Cumbrian lakes (NW England), Norwegian lakes, Finnish lakes, Greek lakes, Croatian freshwater systems, Bohemian hydrosphere, Savannah River Site (USA), and other European contexts.
- Publication years span from 1985 to 2009, with a focus on post-Chernobyl variation and long-term turnover dynamics.

## Key data themes and variables
- Ecological half-lives and effective half-lives of radiocaesium in fish and aquatic environments.
- Turnover, uptake and elimination processes of radiocaesium.
- Effects of body size and trophic level on radiocaesium dynamics.
- Species studied include brown trout (Salmo trutta), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), carp (Cyprinus carpio), among others; also data related to hydrosphere and, in at least one study, wild boar.
- Matrices and contexts: fish tissue, lake/river water, and other aquatic media; post-Chernobyl and long-term monitoring perspectives.

## Data governance and standardization considerations
- For integration, harmonize: radionuclide (Cs-137, 90Sr), concentration units, time since contamination, organism size metrics, sampling dates, and geographic location.
- Metadata to capture for each entry: authors, year, title, journal, study location, species, biological matrix, radionuclide, measured values, half-life estimates, and any data quality notes.

## Data quality, provenance, and interoperability
- Expect methodological variability across studies; document measurement techniques, detection limits, and calibrations.
- Ensure traceability to original sources and preserve complete bibliographic references for reproducibility.

## Practical implications for data stewards
- Need to consolidate diverse study datasets into a single searchable resource with consistent formatting and compatibility with other ecological datasets.
- Plan for updates as new studies are published; manage any data access restrictions or embargoed datasets.

## Gaps and considerations
- Potential gaps in regional or taxonomic coverage; user needs may be incomplete.
- Variability in data formats across studies necessitates a robust harmonization strategy to achieve interoperability.
