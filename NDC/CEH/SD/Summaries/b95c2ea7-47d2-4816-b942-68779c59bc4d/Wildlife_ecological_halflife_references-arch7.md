# References for ecological half-life database

- This document is a bibliography of studies on radiocaesium dynamics and ecological half-lives across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, with a focus on post-Chernobyl data.

## Geographic and ecological scope
- Regions and systems represented:
  - Northwest England: post-Chernobyl radiocaesium in brown trout and lake fish (Cumbrian lakes)
  - Norway: radiocaesium turnover in Arctic char
  - Croatia: long-term radiocaesium in carp
  - Bohemia (Czech Republic): hydrosphere Cs isotopes
  - Finland: transfer of 90Sr in lakes
  - Greece: environmental study of radioactive cesium in lake fish
  - USA (Savannah River Site): ecological half-lives of Cs-137 in fish and other media
  - Germany: Cs-137 contamination in wild boar
- Organisms and media:
  - Fish species (brown trout, Arctic char, carp, etc.)
  - Other wildlife (snakes, wild boar)
  - Aquatic systems (lakes, streams, hydrosphere)
  - Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems

## Data types and variables referenced
- Key concepts and measurements:
  - Ecological half-lives and effective half-lives of radiocaesium (Cs-137)
  - Uptake and elimination kinetics in fish
  - Turnover and time-dependent contamination dynamics
  - Influence of body size and trophic level on radiocaesium dynamics
  - Variation sources in post-Chernobyl radiocaesium levels

## Temporal coverage
- Publication span: 1985 through 2013
- Emphasis on long-term trends and post-Chernobyl data across multiple years

## Relevance for GIS and data integration
- The references provide diverse time-series and spatially distributed data that could inform GIS analyses of radiocaesium dynamics.
- Data are spread across regions, species, and ecosystems, highlighting the need for harmonization, standardization, and careful data quality assessment.
- Potential GIS applications:
  - Mapping spatial patterns of ecological half-lives and Cs-137 concentrations
  - Building temporal layers to visualize changes over time
  - Integrating with hydrological and ecological datasets to model transfer pathways

## Data quality, standardization, and integration considerations
- Data are heterogeneous across regions, species, and measurement methods.
- Aligning units, measurement techniques, and temporal scales will be necessary for GIS integration.
- Gaps likely exist in spatial resolution and comprehensive datasets for certain regions or taxa.
- Robust provenance and metadata are essential to combine datasets reliably in map-based analyses.

## Practical notes for GIS workflow
- Use as a bibliographic backbone to source datasets for radiocaesium dynamics.
- Extract time-series and spatial information to build GIS layers of ecological half-lives and Cs-137 concentrations.
- Combine with environmental layers (water bodies, sediment, biota distributions) to model transfer pathways and regional risk.

## Access and reuse
- Primary information resides in published scientific journals; data access will depend on individual articles and any supplementary materials.
