# Radionuclide biological half-life values for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife

## Summary of aims and scope
- International collaboration under the IAEA MODARIA programme to review and compile wildlife T1/2b (biological half-life) values.
- Grouping by ecosystem and/or organism; aim to build a database aligned with the Wildlife Transfer Database used by IAEA and others.
- Purpose: identify studies reporting T1/2b or elimination rate constants (k) so T1/2b can be estimated; support wildlife transfer modelling and data-driven decision making.

## Data collection and organization
- A recording sheet in MS Excel was designed to collate data components into the final database.
- Wildlife categories broadly align with prior databases and IAEA conventions; Changeover time defined as the intersection point of two successive depuration curves on a log scale, helpful when fractions of loss in components are not directly reported.
- English common names were not standardised; Latin names not updated in this review.

## Data sources and search strategy
- Comprehensive literature search across: Web of Knowledge, Scopus, IAEA INIS, PubMed; targeted grey literature (e.g., OSTI).
- Journals searched include Journal of Environmental Radioactivity, Science of the Total Environment, Radiation Protection Dosimetry, Health Physics, International Journal of Radiation Biology, Journal of Radiological Protection, Journal of Radiation Research.
- Searches used terms related to biological half-life, depuration/transfer kinetics, accumulation rates, and organism names.
- Reviews of Japanese and Russian-language literature conducted; where necessary, k values were estimated from reported data by fitting exponential relationships (using MATCAD).
- Previous reviews used as leads but preferred sources consulted directly when possible.
- Ecosystem coverage includes terrestrial, freshwater, and marine; domestic animals (dogs and cats) included for relevance to wildlife data, while farm animals were largely excluded (with some geese/ducks possibly originating from domesticated stock).

## Calculations and data derivation
- T1/2b values may be reported directly or derived from elimination rate constants (k).
- Where only At (initial activity) remaining at time t is reported, k and thus T1/2b can be estimated using the relation between remaining activity, time, and k.
- T1/2b (in days) can subsequently be calculated from k using standard decay-kinetics relationships.
- Some data are derived from secondary sources; in those cases, priority was given to consulting original references when possible.

## Quality control and data validation
- Independent quality check performed by co-authors not involved in data compilation.
- At least 10% of entries re-checked against source references; some key data sources fully checked.
- Issues investigated and corrected as required by original data originators.
- Some compiled data already used in allometric wildlife models (terrestrial and marine) and subjected to additional QC; reptile data specifically re-verified.
- A quality-control flag was added to approximately 40% of entries.
- Duplicate entries identified and removed.
- Approximately 165 freshwater ecological half-life data points (Cs and Sr) identified and retained in a separate datasheet; these were not quality-controlled.

## Outputs, usage, and data products
- Outputs have supported allometric approaches for terrestrial wildlife and marine wildlife and contributed to model development (e.g., ERICA Tool).
- Data have informed the development of radiation transfer models and ecological half-life concepts.
- Data and related work have been published and used in subsequent tools and analyses, with contributions compiled into the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre, and collaboration outputs such as STAR-MODARIA workshops.

## References and context
- The document builds on foundational reviews and databases (e.g., Beresford et al.; Vives i Batlle et al.; Alonzo; CIESM; ERICA Tool).
- Key cross-references include IAEA MODARIA activities and related methodological developments in wildlife transfer modelling and data curation.
