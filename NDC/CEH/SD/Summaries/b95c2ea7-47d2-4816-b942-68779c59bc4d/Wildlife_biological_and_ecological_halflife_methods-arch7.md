# Methods extracted from: Radionuclide biological half-life values for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife

## Summary of purpose and scope
- International collaboration under IAEA MODARIA to review and compile biological half-life values (T1/2b) for wildlife.
- Division of work by ecosystem and/or organism; aim to create a final database of T1/2b values or elimination rate constants from which T1/2b can be estimated.
- Inclusion spans terrestrial, freshwater, and marine wildlife; domesticated dogs and cats included to supplement wildlife data; most farm animal data excluded except where relevant to wildlife comparisons.

## Data collection, structure, and standardization
- Data compilation organized via an MS Excel recording sheet designed to collate components into a final database.
- Wildlife group categorizations aligned with the Wildlife Transfer Database for compatibility; English common names not standardized and Latin names not updated.
- Changeover time defined as the intersection point of two depuration curves on a log scale; used when direct fractions of loss are not reported.
- Aimed to capture studies reporting T1/2b or elimination rate constants from which T1/2b can be derived; some T1/2b values inferred from reported percentages of initial activity remaining.

## Estimation methods and data interpretation
- T1/2b values derived from elimination rate constants (k) when available; percentages remaining at time t used to estimate k and then T1/2b.
- Use of exponential fitting to extract kinetic parameters from data where not directly reported (e.g., some Russian-language sources via MATCAD).

## Data sources and literature search strategy
- Systematic searches across multiple major bibliographic databases: Web of Knowledge, Scopus, IAEA INIS, PubMed.
- Targeted searches of grey literature (e.g., OSTI) and on-line journal collections (e.g., Journal of Environmental Radioactivity, Science of the Total Environment, Radiation Protection Dosimetry, Health Physics, etc.).
- Language coverage included Japanese and Russian literature; additional data from in-house and PhD studies.
- Prior reviews used as starting points but preferred to source original references when possible.

## Data scope, exceptions, and notes
- Terrestrial data include some non-wildlife species (e.g., dogs, cats) because they are rarely collated elsewhere; farm animals largely excluded with limited exceptions (geese and ducks).
- Some datasets (e.g., certain Cs and Sr ecological half-life data, ~165 entries) retained in a separate sheet and not quality controlled.
- No attempt to standardize species names beyond what was available in source references; database acknowledges potential updates to nomenclature since original publications.

## Quality control and data curation
- Independent quality check performed by co-authors not involved in data compilation.
- Minimum QC: at least 10% of entries re-verified against source references; some key data sources fully rechecked.
- Quality-controlled flag added to entries (approximately 40% of the database); duplicates identified and removed.
- Quality checks informed subsequent use in allometric and transfer-model work (terrestrial and marine wildlife); reptile data underwent extensive verification.

## Data usage and integration
- Compiled data used to develop allometric approaches and wildlife transfer models (terrestrial, marine); supports development of data-driven ecological risk assessments and radioecology studies.
- Database designed to facilitate data integration, cross-ecosystem comparisons, and model parameterization, with an emphasis on clear provenance and traceability to primary sources.
