# Methods extracted from: Radionuclide biological half-life values for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife

- Purpose and scope
  - International effort under IAEA MODARIA to review and compile biological half-life values (T1/2b) for wildlife.
  - Work divided by ecosystem and/or organism by the working group’s expertise.
  - Aimed to identify studies reporting T1/2b or elimination rate constants (k) from which T1/2b can be estimated.

- Data recording and structure
  - Used an MS Excel recording sheet to collate components into a final database.
  - Wildlife group categorizations aligned with the Wildlife Transfer Database and later IAEA standards.
  - Changeover time defined as the intersection of two successive depuration curves on a log scale, useful when component loss fractions aren’t directly reported.
  - English common names not standardized; Latin names not updated.

- Derivation of T1/2b values
  - T1/2b estimated from reported k values or from A_t percent remaining at time t using exponential relationships.
  - Equations provided (and references to how T1/2b is derived from k or from residual percentages).

- Data sources and literature search
  - Searched Web of Knowledge, Scopus, IAEA INIS, PubMed.
  - Targeted grey literature searches (e.g., OSTI) and key journals (e.g., Journal of Environmental Radioactivity, The Science of the Total Environment, Radiation Protection Dosimetry, Health Physics, etc.).
  - Search terms included ‘biological half-life’, ‘biological period’, ‘kinetic transfer modelling’, ‘accumulation rate’, ‘depuration rate’, and species names.
  - Reviewed Japanese and Russian language literature; some Russian data were extracted by fitting exponential relationships with MATCAD.
  - Used previous reviews to identify sources and supplemented with in-house studies (e.g., French PhD work).

- Ecosystem and species coverage
  - Terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems reviewed.
  - Data included some domesticated animals (dog and cat) due to relevance; most farm animal data were excluded except potential geese/ducks from domesticated sources.

- Data compatibility and references
  - Aligns with earlier reviews and databases (e.g., compatibility with ERICA Tool data for terrestrial biota, marine datasets).
  - References include key reviews and projects (Kitchings et al., Whicker & Schultz, Stara et al., Alonzo; Vives i Batlle et al.; CIESM; EPA; Gomez & Russo; and others).

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Independent quality check conducted by co-authors not involved in data compilation.
  - Minimum 10% of entries re-verified against source references; some key sources fully rechecked.
  - Issues resolved with original data originators; additional quality checks linked to related allometric modeling work.
  - A quality-control column added to the database; about 40% of entries underwent quality control.
  - Duplicate entries identified and removed.
  - An additional dataset (approximately 165 entries, mainly freshwater ecological half-lives for Cs and Sr) retained separately; these entries were not quality controlled.

- Data usage and impact
  - Some compiled data used in developing allometric approaches for terrestrial and marine wildlife.
  - Data have informed models and tools (e.g., ERICA Tool) for risk assessment and transfer studies.

- Limitations and caveats
  - Changeover time relies on intersection of depuration curves; uncertainties may arise if data are sparse.
  - Not all data were quality controlled; a substantial portion remained unverified in the separate ecological half-life dataset.
  - Non-standardization of common names and incomplete Latin name updates could affect cross-referencing.

- Summary for data-leadership perspective
  - A comprehensive, multi-source effort to assemble and harmonize T1/2b data for wildlife across ecosystems.
  - Emphasizes robust data collection, transparent derivation methods, and rigorous quality control.
  - Demonstrates integration with existing data infrastructure and relevance to practical tools (ERIKA, wildlife transfer modeling).
  - Highlights ongoing challenges in data availability, standardization, and cross-language data inclusion.
