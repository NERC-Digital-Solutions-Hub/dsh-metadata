# Radionuclide biological half-life values for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife

## Overview
- International study conducted under the IAEA MODARIA program to review and compile biological half-life values (T1/2b) for wildlife.
- Purpose: identify useful environmental health measures for evaluating policy and informing future monitoring decisions.

## Methods and study design
- Work organized by ecosystem and organism by an international working group.
- A recording sheet in MS Excel was created to standardise data collation into a final database.
- Wildlife group categorisations aligned with the Wildlife Transfer Database and IAEA guidance; Changeover time defined as the intersection point of depuration curves on a log scale, useful when direct loss fractions aren’t reported.
- No attempt to fully standardise common/n Latin names; focus on data compatibility rather than taxonomic nomenclature updates.

## Data and calculations
- Target values: T1/2b (time for initial activity to halve) or elimination rate constants (k), from which T1/2b can be derived.
- When only percent of initial activity remaining at time t (At) was reported, k and hence T1/2b were estimated using reported formulas.
- Data sources included major bibliographic databases (Web of Knowledge, Scopus, INIS, PubMed) and targeted grey literature (e.g., OSTI), plus key journals relevant to environmental radiology.
- Language coverage extended to Japanese and Russian literature; where necessary, exponential relationships were fitted to data (via MATCAD) to estimate missing parameters.

## Data scope and taxa
- Coverage across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.
- Included data for domesticated dogs and cats for relevance to some wildlife species; most farm animal data were excluded except possible contributions to geese and duck datasets.

## Data collection and sourcing details
- Reviews of earlier literature used to identify source references; preference given to consulting the original sources rather than relying solely on secondary reviews.
- Recognised key prior reviews for terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems (e.g., Kitchings et al., Whicker & Schultz, Alonzo; Vives i Batlle and others).
- Additional data gathered from in-house studies and national programmes (e.g., French radiological protection research).

## Quality control and data governance
- Independent quality check performed by co-authors not involved in data compilation.
- Minimum verification: at least 10% of entries re-checked against source references; some key sources fully reviewed.
- Quality-controlled entries flagged in the database (approximately 40% of entries).
- Duplicate entries identified and removed.
- A subset of ecological half-life data for Cs and Sr (n=165, mainly freshwater) retained in a separate datasheet and not quality-controlled.
- The database has been used to develop allometric approaches for wildlife transfer modelling and related work; quality checks extended to reptile data as part of ongoing verification.
- The dataset was made available via the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (with a DOI applied) and linked to discussions from the STAR-MODARIA workshop on making data available.

## Data presentation and outputs
- Findings and data are presented in relationship to transfer modelling and allometric approaches for wildlife (terrestrial, marine) and information on model inputs (e.g., default transfer parameters).
- References and data provenance are documented, enabling traceability back to original publications.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Provides a structured, quality-controlled methodology for compiling environmental health indicators (biological half-lives) across ecosystems.
- Demonstrates practical solutions to common monitoring challenges:
  - Standardized data capture formats and cross-database compatibility.
  - Transparent handling of incomplete data via estimations from reported metrics.
  - Multilingual literature integration and archival data governance.
  - Explicit quality control, data provenance, and data availability through a data centre.
- Highlights the importance of metadata, data transformation, and governance to ensure datasets are usable for policy evaluation and decision-making.
