# References for biological half-life database

- A comprehensive bibliography of studies on biological half-lives and biokinetics of radionuclides across ecosystems and species
- Covers uptake from water and diet, tissue distribution, depuration, and turnover (bioaccumulation) in aquatic and terrestrial organisms
- Key radionuclides frequently addressed include 137Cs, 60Co, 54Mn, 110mAg, 65Zn, 85Sr, 239Pu, 241Am, and others, with attention to forms and exposure pathways
- Organisms span a wide range, such as freshwater fish (e.g., rainbow trout, carp, goldfish, brown trout), marine/planktonic species, bivalves and molluscs, crustaceans (e.g., Daphnia, mussels), earthworms, birds (ducks, geese, shorebirds), mammals, amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates
- Includes both controlled laboratory experiments and field studies, as well as theses and conference proceedings, reflecting diverse methodologies and environments
- Temporal scope extends from the 1960s through the 2010s, with numerous regional and international studies (French, Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, English sources among others)
- Emphasizes development and refinement of biokinetic models and transfer charts, including:
  - Uptake routes (waterborne vs dietary)
  - Tissue-specific distribution and retention
  - Depuration and elimination rates
  - Effects of external factors (temperature, body size, diet, salinity, exposure form)
  - Allometric and kinematic approaches to parameterize biokinetic processes
- Useful for environmental monitoring and dose assessment by supporting standardized, data-driven estimates of internal radionuclide doses
- Geographic and methodological diversity aids cross-site comparisons but also highlights variability in biological half-lives across species and conditions
- Provides a foundation for data integration, quality assurance, and model-informed decision-making in environmental health and policy monitoring contexts
