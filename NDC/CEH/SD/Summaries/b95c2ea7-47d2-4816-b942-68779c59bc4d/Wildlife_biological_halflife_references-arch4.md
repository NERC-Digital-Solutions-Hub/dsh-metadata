# References for biological half-life database

## Overview
- A comprehensive bibliography compiling studies on biokinetics and biological half-life of radionuclides across diverse ecosystems and organisms, intended to support a biological half-life database.
- Covers a broad historical span and a wide range of radionuclides, species, exposure routes, and ecological contexts.

## What this document contains
- An extensive, multi-language reference list including journal articles, theses, conference reports, and monographs.
- Entries span topics such as uptake from water, dietary transfer, depuration, tissue distribution, and turnover/biokinetic rates.
- Examples of radionuclides featured: Cs-137, Cs-134, Sr-90, 60Co, 54Mn, 110mAg, 65Zn, 85Sr, 239Pu, 241Am, 131I, 106Ru, and others.
- Organisms represented include freshwater and marine fish, invertebrates (molluscs, crustaceans, Daphnia), birds, mammals, amphibians, earthworms, and algae.

## Data types and parameters represented
- Uptake pathways: waterborne, dietary, sediment-associated transfer, and combinations thereof.
- Biokinetic endpoints: accumulation, retention/biological half-life, depuration, tissue distribution, and overall turnover.
- Experimental contexts: laboratory-controlled studies, field observations, in situ experiments, and modelling efforts.
- Notes on experimental factors: temperature, body size, life stage, salinity, chemical form of radionuclides, and multi-pollutant environments.

## Data quality, standardization, and accessibility
- High heterogeneity across studies in species, exposure conditions, and measurement units, complicating cross-study comparisons.
- Many records are in various languages (French, Russian, Japanese, etc.) and some are theses or reports with limited access, including paywalls.
- Standardization needs include harmonizing units, exposure routes, chemical forms, and the specific biokinetic parameters reported.

## Gaps and challenges
- Data gaps for certain radionuclides and for many species, especially at finer taxonomic or ecological resolution.
- Variability in experimental designs and reporting standards hampers aggregation into a uniform database.
- Access barriers due to paywalls and language diversity may limit the comprehensiveness of the compiled dataset.

## Implications for data strategy and next steps (Data Leaders perspective)
- Data governance:
  - Implement metadata standards capturing: author, year, species, radionuclide, exposure route, tissue(s) studied, measured parameter, units, methods, and data availability.
  - Track data provenance and ensure versioning to support reproducibility and auditability.
- Data quality and standardization:
  - Develop protocols to harmonize biokinetic parameters (e.g., half-lives, uptake rates) across studies and convert to consistent units and formats.
  - Create guidelines for handling multi-factor experiments (temperature, diet, co-pollutants) to contextualize parameters.
- Accessibility and discoverability:
  - Build indexing and translation support for non-English sources; link to full texts where possible and indicate access status.
  - Maintain a living bibliography with regular updates as new studies emerge.
- Gaps prioritization and collaboration:
  - Identify radionuclides and organisms with sparse data to target for data generation or targeted literature review.
  - Foster cross-disciplinary collaboration between radiological science, ecology, and environmental modelling communities to expand and refine the database.
- Strategic value:
  - Enables more accurate transfer and dose modelling of radionuclides through ecosystems and supports public exposure assessments and environmental safety decisions.
