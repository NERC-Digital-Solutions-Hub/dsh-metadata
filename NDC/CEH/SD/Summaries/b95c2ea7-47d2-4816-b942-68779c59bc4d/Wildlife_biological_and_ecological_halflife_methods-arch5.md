# Methods extracted from: Radionuclide biological half-life values for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife

## Overview
- International collaboration under the IAEA MODARIA programme to review and compile biological half-life values (T1/2b) for wildlife across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
- Review work divided among group members by ecosystem and organism expertise; aims to support a comprehensive, usable database.
- A recording sheet in MS Excel was designed to collate data components into the final database; categorizations aligned with the Wildlife Transfer Database.

## Data capture and structure
- Recording sheet entry fields documented to standardize data collection.
- Changeover time defined as the intersection point of two successive depuration curves from regression lines on a log scale; useful when fractions of loss are not directly reported.
- No standardization of English common names or updating of Latin species names; acknowledges potential nomenclature changes since original publications.

## Methods for deriving T1/2b
- Reviewed studies reporting T1/2b (time for initial activity to halve) or elimination rate constants (k) to estimate T1/2b.
- T1/2b can be estimated from reported percentages of initial activity remaining at time t.
- Formulas referenced for deriving k and subsequently T1/2b (details indicated by placeholder equations in the text).

## Data sources and searches
- Searches across major databases: Web of Knowledge, Scopus, IAEA INIS, PubMed.
- Targeted grey literature searches (e.g., DOE OSTI) and online key journals in the field.
- Search terms included: “biological half-life,” “biological period,” “kinetic transfer modelling,” “accumulation rate,” “depuration rate,” and species names.
- Included reviews of Japanese and Russian literature; where needed, k and T1/2b values were estimated by fitting exponential relationships (using MATCAD).
- Some additional Russian data for birds obtained from Fesenko et al. (2015); and prior reviews used to identify source references but were supplemented by consulting original sources.

## Data synthesis and references
- Where possible, source references were consulted directly rather than relying solely on earlier reviews.
- Prior reviews used as starting points for additional searches to identify further data; knowledge from working group members and in-house studies contributed (e.g., French PhD studies).
- Key prior reviews informing terrestrial, freshwater, and marine data were identified and cited (e.g., Kitchings et al. 1976; Whicker & Schultz 1982; Alonzo 2009; Vives i Batlle 2007–2009; CIESM 2002; EPA 2013).

## Ecosystem coverage and species
- Coverage spans terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.
- Domesticated dogs and cats included due to relevance to wildlife data gaps; farm animal data largely excluded except where relevant to certain wildlife species (e.g., geese and ducks possibly linked to domesticated origins).

## Quality control and data governance
- Independent quality check performed by co-authors not involved in data compilation.
- Minimum 10% of entered data re-verified against source references; some key sources fully rechecked.
- Issues resolved by data originators; entries in allometric and related studies have undergone additional checks.
- A quality-control flag column added; about 40% of entries were quality controlled.
- Duplicate entries identified and removed.
- Approximately 165 freshwater ecological half-life data entries identified and retained in a separate datasheet; these were not quality controlled.

## Data availability and repository
- Database contributions used in the development of allometric approaches for wildlife transfer models (terrestrial and marine).
- Data documented and tied to broader data-sharing efforts (e.g., STAR-MODARIA workshop on making data available; IAEA collaboration).
- The database is linked to or referenced in the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (data DOI and related publications listed).
