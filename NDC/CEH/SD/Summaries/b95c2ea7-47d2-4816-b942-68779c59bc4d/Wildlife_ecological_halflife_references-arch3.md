# References for ecological half-life database

## Overview
- Compiles studies on ecological half-lives and radiocaesium dynamics in aquatic and related environments following the Chernobyl incident.
- Emphasizes long-term trends, uptake/elimination processes, and factors affecting radiocaesium persistence in biota and ecosystems.

## Scope and Topics Covered
- Long-term dynamics and declines of radiocesium in wildlife and water bodies.
- Variation sources in radiocaesium levels: species, body size, trophic level, and environmental context.
- Key concepts: ecological half-lives, effective half-lives, uptake and elimination rates.
- Media and organisms studied include fish (various species), hydrosphere components, and terrestrial links (e.g., wild boar).
- Geographical coverage includes the UK (Cumbrian lakes), Norway, North Croatia, Finland, Greece, Bohemia, and the Savannah River Site (USA), among others.
- Temporal scope primarily centers on post-Chernobyl monitoring and long-term data series.
- Methodological themes: comparing experimental and real-world inputs, size- and species-specific dynamics, and turnover in different ecosystems.

## Data and Monitoring Implications for Policymaking
- Provides a foundation for selecting indicators of radiocaesium persistence and ecological half-lives in monitoring frameworks.
- Highlights the importance of long-term, cross-site data to understand variation and trends.
- Illustrates how body size, species, and trophic level influence radiocaesium dynamics, informing targeted monitoring (which species and life stages to prioritize).
- Underlines the need for robust metadata and standardized methods to enable cross-study comparability in monitoring programs.

## Practical Considerations for Monitoring Framework Authors
- When designing monitoring, consider ecological half-life concepts as core indicators of environmental health and contaminant persistence.
- Ensure data collection supports long-term trend analysis (consistent timing, frequency, and media).
- Prioritize data quality, transparent reporting, and clear presentation (reports, charts, dashboards) to support decision-making.
- Plan for data sharing and metadata availability to facilitate open-data governance and reuse across programs.
