# References for biological half-life database

## Overview
- A comprehensive bibliography of studies on the biological half-life, uptake, depuration, and transfer of radionuclides in aquatic and terrestrial organisms.
- Spans decades of literature (roughly 1960s–2010s) and includes both experimental and in situ field data.
- Covers a wide range of taxa, radionuclides, and environmental pathways, intended to support biokinetic modeling and environmental risk assessment.

## What the collection covers
- Taxa represented:
  - Fish (e.g., rainbow trout, brown trout, carp, eel, pike, goby, goldfish, salmon, perch)
  - Invertebrates (e.g., Daphnia, mussels Mytilus spp., oysters, clams, polychaetes, shrimp Crangon, crayfish)
  - Birds (e.g., mallards, geese, ducks)
  - Mammals (e.g., mice, rats, voles, rabbits, muskrats)
  - Amphibians and reptiles (e.g., frogs, turtles)
- Radionuclides and related isotopes:
  - Cesium-137 (Cs-137), Cesium-134 (Cs-134)
  - Strontium-90 (Sr-90)
  - Cobalt-60 (Co-60), Nickel and Zinc isotopes (e.g., Zn-65)
  - 54 Mn, 60 Co, 110m Ag,  origin common in many entries
  - 95m Tc, 95 Zr, 106 Ru, 239/240 Pu, 241 Am, Iodine-131, Neptunium, Plutonium, Americium
  - Others including 58 Co, 65 Zn, 90 Sr, 134 Cs, 137 Cs, and various trace metals
- Environmental contexts and pathways:
  - Waterborne uptake, dietary (food/web) transfer, sediment and plankton associations
  - Tissue distribution, whole-body versus organ-specific kinetics
  - Depuration/elimination dynamics and factors affecting biokinetics (temperature, body size, life stage, salinity, diet, metal interactions)
  - Dynamic transfer models linking water-to-biota and trophic transfer

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Provides parameter sets and equations for biokinetic modeling (uptake rates, elimination/half-life, tissue partitioning).
- Enables development and validation of species-specific transfer coefficients and biological half-lives for inclusion in environmental health indicators and dashboards.
- Supports assessment of internal dose pathways by detailing how radionuclides move through the food web and accumulate in tissues.
- Useful for scenario analysis in policy evaluations, such as responses to radiological releases or long-term monitoring of contaminated sites.

## Key modeling and data insights
- Uptake versus depuration dynamics across species and environments.
- Influence of external factors (temperature, salinity, diet composition, body size) on biokinetic rates.
- Distinct pathways: waterborne uptake, dietary intake, and combined pathways; differences in tissue distribution (e.g., liver, muscle, gonads, digestive tract).
- Temperature and seasonality effects on retention and turnover.
- Allometric approaches and methods for estimating biokinetic parameters across marine and freshwater biota.

## Data and metadata considerations for implementation
- The collection collates diverse study types (lab experiments, mesocosms, field observations) and languages (French, Russian, Japanese, etc.), which may require translation and careful extraction of methods and conditions.
- Many entries predate modern data standards; implementing them in modern monitoring requires:
  - Clear extraction of species, life stage, exposure route, dose metrics, and environmental conditions.
  - Documentation of experimental vs. field settings and any extrapolations.
  - Harmonization of units, time scales, and reporting formats.
- Data sharing and metadata transparency are essential to reuse these results in monitoring frameworks without duplicating efforts.

## Gaps, caveats, and considerations
- High variability across species, life stages, and environmental conditions; transfer and half-life are context-dependent.
- Potential gaps in metadata for some older studies; non-English sources may present accessibility barriers.
- Differences between controlled experimental results and real-world field conditions; caution when extrapolating.
- Some radionuclides and organisms are underrepresented relative to others; plan for targeted data collection to fill key gaps.

## How to use this resource
- Use as a foundational bibliography to parameterize and validate biokinetic models in monitoring frameworks.
- Extract species- and radionuclide-specific uptake and depuration rates to build or refine environmental health indicators.
- Inform data governance plans by identifying which studies provide high-quality, transferable data and what metadata are needed for reuse.
- Guide future data collection priorities to address identified gaps and ensure metadata completeness and consistency.
