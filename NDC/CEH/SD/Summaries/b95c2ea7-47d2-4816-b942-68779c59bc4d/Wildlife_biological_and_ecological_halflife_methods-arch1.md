# Radionuclide biological half-life values for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife

- Aim: Compile and review biological half-life values (T1/2b) or elimination rate constants for radionuclides in wildlife (terrestrial and aquatic) to support transfer modeling and risk assessment under the IAEA MODARIA program. Values can be used to derive T1/2b when only rate constants or retention data are reported.

- Scope and organization
  - International working group under IAEA MODARIA; tasks divided by ecosystem and/or organism expertise.
  - Recording sheet designed in Excel to collate data into a final database.
  - Wildlife categorisations aligned with the Wildlife Transfer Database; English/common names not standardised; Latin names may be outdated but acknowledged.
  - Changeover time defined as the intersection point of successive depuration curves (regression lines on a log scale), useful when fractions of loss are not directly reported.

- Data and calculations
  - T1/2b values derived directly or estimated from reported percent remaining (A_t) at time t using standard exponential relationships.
  - Formulas used include calculating the elimination rate constant k and deriving T1/2b from k.
  - Some Russian-language data were digitised and fitted via exponential relationships using MATCAD; additional Russian data for birds were incorporated from other reviews.

- Data sources and search strategy
  - Systematic searches of Web of Knowledge, Scopus, IAEA INIS, PubMed; targeted grey literature (e.g., OSTI) and key journals (e.g., Journal of Environmental Radioactivity, The Science of the Total Environment, Radiation Protection Dosimetry, Health Physics, etc.).
  - Language reviews (Japanese, Russian) conducted to identify suitable data; some data from non-English sources required re-derivation.
  - Earlier reviews used as starting points; whenever possible, source references were consulted directly rather than relying solely on prior reviews.
  - Additional in-house and PhD studies contributed data (notably French sources).

- Data coverage and inclusion decisions
  - Terrestrial data include domesticated dogs and cats due to scarcity of other wildlife data; farm animal data largely excluded except where relevant (e.g., some geese/ducks may originate from domestic lines).
  - Freshwater ecological half-life data (Cs and Sr) identified and retained in a separate datasheet; these data were not quality controlled.

- Quality control and data curation
  - Independent quality check by co-authors not involved in data compilation; minimum 10% of entries verified by reference back-check; more exhaustive checks for key sources.
  - Some entries and datasets have undergone additional quality checks; a dedicated QC flag was added to entries (about 40% QC’d).
  - Duplicate entries identified and removed; overall dataset cross-checked against established allometric and wildlife transfer modeling work.
  - A separate dataset (n ≈ 165, primarily freshwater) for ecological half-life rates was retained but not quality controlled.

- Data use and availability
  - The compiled data have informed allometric approaches for terrestrial and marine wildlife transfer modeling and related studies.
  - The database is intended to be discoverable and usable with metadata; related work includes ERICA tool development and wildlife transfer parameter derivations.
  - References list includes key foundational reviews and datasets (e.g., Alonzo 2009; Beresford et al.; Vives i Batlle et al.; CIESM; EPA; and others) to support data provenance and traceability.

- Notes
  - No standardisation of common names; adherence to original species naming as reported.
  - Some data and methods are linked to workshop reports and collaborations within the MODARIA STAR program.
  - The resulting database and documentation are positioned as resources for ongoing data discovery and model development in radiological protection and environmental radioactivity research.
