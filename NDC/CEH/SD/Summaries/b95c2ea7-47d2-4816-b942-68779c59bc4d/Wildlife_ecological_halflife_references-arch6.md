# References for ecological half-life database

- Purpose and scope
  - A curated bibliography intended to support building and validating an ecological half-life database for radiocaesium (Cs-137) in ecological systems.
  - Covers studies across aquatic and some terrestrial contexts, with a focus on long-term trends, turnover, uptake/elimination, and factors influencing ecological half-lives.

- Key topics and focal organisms/systems
  - Fish and lakes: post-Chernobyl radiocaesium variation, turnover, and accumulation in species such as brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) from various lakes (e.g., six Cumbrian lakes; Norwegian lakes).
  - Terrestrial and other fauna: examples include radiocesium declines in snakes and time-dependent contamination in wild boar.
  - Systems studied: freshwater lakes and rivers (UK, Norway, Finland, Greece, Croatia, Bohemia), streams, and anthropogenically affected sites (e.g., Savannah River Site in the USA; reactor effluent-impacted systems).
  - Key themes: ecological half-lives, sources of variation, uptake and elimination in fish, transfer in lakes, and comparative/experimental assessments of Cs-137 and other radionuclides (e.g., 90Sr).

- Representative study types and findings reflected
  - Long-term declines and turnover of radiocesium in aquatic and terrestrial organisms.
  - Variation sources in radiocaesium concentrations among populations, lakes, and post-Chernobyl contexts.
  - Size- and trophic-level effects on Cs-137 uptake and retention in fish.
  - Comparative and experimental approaches to understanding Cs-137 dynamics in contaminated systems.

- Data product implications for Data Support
  - Enables extraction of standardized data points (half-lives, uptake/elimination rates, species, habitat, contamination context) to populate a centralized database.
  - Supports cross-study comparisons, meta-analyses, and the development of dashboards or reports that allow end-users to explore ecological half-life patterns by species, system, and time since contamination.
  - Provides provenance and context for data, aiding quality assurance and reproducibility when merging datasets from diverse studies.

- Data considerations and preparation notes
  - Expect heterogeneity across studies in units, time scales, and measurement methods; harmonization will be required.
  - Important to capture contextual variables (species, body size, trophic level, lake/system type, post-Chernobyl timing) that influence observed half-lives.
  - Potential challenges include variability in data completeness and varying geographic/temporal coverage, which should be documented during data extraction.
