# References for biological half-life database

- Purpose and scope
  - A comprehensive bibliography compiled to support a biological half-life database, focusing on uptake, transfer, retention, and depuration of radionuclides in living organisms.
  - Covers both waterborne and dietary pathways, tissue distribution, and kinetic modeling relevant to radiological risk assessment.

- Radionuclides represented
  - Key elements and radionuclides repeatedly investigated in biokinetic studies: cesium-137 (137Cs), cobalt-60 (60Co), manganese-54 (54Mn), silver-110m (110mAg), zinc-65 (65Zn), strontium-90 (90Sr), plutonium-239 (239Pu), americium-241 (241Am), iodine-131 (131I), neptunium, cadmium and other trace metals in some entries.
  - Various other radionuclides appear (e.g., ruthenium-106, technetium isotopes, lead isotopes, nickel, uranium, hafnium, etc.) across different studies.

- Organisms and systems covered
  - Aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates: freshwater and marine fish (e.g., rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, brown trout Salmo trutta, carp Cyprinus carpio, tuna-like species, eel, goby, mussels Mytilus edulis, Dreissena polymorpha, Scenedesmus obliquus as a microalga in some transfers, Daphnia magna, chironomid larvae, crabs, lobsters, sea urchins, scallops, clams, and other molluscs).
  - Terrestrial and semi-terrestrial organisms: earthworms (Eisenia fetida), birds (mallard Anas platyrhynchos, geese), reptiles and amphibians (turtles, frogs, lizards), small mammals (mice, voles) in various contexts.
  - Model and ecosystem studies: laboratory and field experiments, and ecosystem or food-web approaches to radionuclide turnover and transfer.

- Data types and modeling themes
  - Biological half-lives, uptake and depuration rates from water and from diet, tissue distribution, and whole-organism turnover.
  - Transfer models and kinetic rate analyses linking water, sediment, and dietary pathways to bioconcentration in organisms.
  - Allometric and other methodological approaches to estimate biokinetic parameters; model development for aquatic and terrestrial systems.
  - Factors influencing kinetics: temperature, body size, age, salinity, chemical form/complexation, diet composition, and exposure route.
  - Comparisons of uptake via water versus food, and the influence of environmental variables on retention and elimination.

- Geographic and publication variety
  - Studies span multiple countries and languages, including French, Russian, Japanese, and English sources.
  - Includes peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, Annual Reports, and PhD theses; some materials may be older foundational work, while others reflect later investigations.

- Practical considerations for analysts
  - The collection provides diverse sources for extracting numeric biokinetic parameters (half-lives, rate constants, transfer coefficients) to inform environmental models and risk assessments.
  - Data heterogeneity is evident: varying species, experimental conditions, exposure pathways, and units; careful harmonization and critical appraisal are required when integrating figures into a unified database.
  - Some items are theses or report-based sources that may have limited accessibility; others are classic, widely cited papers that offer transferable parameters across contexts.

- Notable themes across the references
  - Temperature and organism size frequently modulate biological half-lives and retention times.
  - Distinctions between waterborne and dietary uptake are central to understanding overall body burden.
  - Chemical form, complexation, and interaction with sediments or organic matter significantly affect bioavailability and depuration rates.
  - Cross-species comparisons help in developing generalizable transfer models but require careful consideration of physiological differences.

- Implications for data-driven decision making
  - This bibliography underpins the empirical grounding for biokinetic modeling, enabling predictions of radionuclide behavior in ecosystems and aiding assessments of environmental and public health risks.
  - It supports calibration and validation of dynamic transfer models used in regulatory contexts, emergency response planning, and long-term environmental stewardship.
