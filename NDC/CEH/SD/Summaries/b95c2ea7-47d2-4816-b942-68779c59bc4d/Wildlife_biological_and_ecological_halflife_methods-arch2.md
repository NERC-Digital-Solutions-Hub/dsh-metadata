# Radionuclide biological half-life values for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife

## Aim and scope
- International effort under IAEA MODARIA to review and compile T1/2b (biological half-life in wildlife) values.
- Work divided among group members by ecosystem and/or organism; aims to support transfer modelling and data availability.

## Data collection and recording
- Used a purpose-designed MS Excel recording sheet to collate data components into a final database.
- Recording fields align with the Wildlife Transfer Database (and later IAEA references).
- Changeover time is the intersection point of two depuration regression lines on a log scale, used when direct fractions are not reported.
- English common names were not standardized; Latin names not updated in this review.

## Definitions and calculations
- T1/2b values derived directly or estimated from elimination rate constants (k).
- When only initial activity remaining at time t is reported, T1/2b is estimated using the relation with k and t.
- Equations provided to convert reported data into T1/2b or k values (as described in the text).

## Data sources and search strategy
- Primary databases: Web of Knowledge, Scopus, IAEA INIS, PubMed.
- Grey literature searches (e.g., OSTI) and key environmental radioactivity journals were scanned.
- Targeted search terms included “biological half-life,” “depuration rate,” and organism names.
- Reviews of Japanese and Russian language literature were conducted; where needed, k and T1/2b were estimated by fitting exponential relationships (MATCAD).
- Some data drawn from or cross-checked with earlier reviews; preference given to source references rather than relying solely on prior reviews.

## Ecosystem and species coverage
- Terrestrial, freshwater, and marine wildlife data considered.
- Domesticated dogs and cats included in the terrestrial dataset due to relevance; farm animal data largely excluded except possible relevance for certain waterfowl data.

## Quality control and data curation
- Independent quality check by co-authors not involved in data compilation.
- Minimum 10% of entries re-verified against source references; some key sources fully checked.
- Issues corrected as required by original data originators; some data validated against prior allometric work.
- A QC indicator column added; approximately 40% of entries quality controlled.
- Duplicate entries removed; separate dataset retained for 165 freshwater ecological half-life data (not quality controlled).

## Data handling and usage
- Data contributed to as inputs for allometric and transfer-model development (terrestrial and marine wildlife applications).
- Used in conjunction with established ecological and radiological models (e.g., ERICA tool) and related wildlife transfer research.
- Data and project outputs linked to STAR/MODARIA workshops on data availability.

## Data management and accessibility
- Final database prepared for broader use and integration with monitoring tools and portals.
- References and context provided for long-term use in environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Key outputs and methodologies discussed in subsequent publications and data-centre repositories (notably NERC Environmental Information Data Centre).
