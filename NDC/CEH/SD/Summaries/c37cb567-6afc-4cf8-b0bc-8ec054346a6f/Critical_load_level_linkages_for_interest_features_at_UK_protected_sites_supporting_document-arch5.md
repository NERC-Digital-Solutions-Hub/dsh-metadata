# Assigning Relevant Critical Loads/Levels to designated features of protected nature conservation sites

- Overview
  - The project assigns relevant critical loads and critical levels to designated features of protected nature conservation sites, using a phased approach across Annex I habitat features, Annex II plant and non-plant species features, SPA features, and A/SSSI habitat features.
  - Critical loads are set for nutrient nitrogen and acidity, linked to habitat classifications (EUNIS, NVC, Broad Habitats) and guided by international frameworks (UNECE, CLRTAP) and national/classification schemes (APIS, NBN).

- Data Governance and stewardship implications for Data Stewards
  - Data scope and governance
    - Involves three main datasets: critical loads/levels linkages for SAC, SPA, and SSSI designated features.
    - Datasets encode rich feature metadata, including codes, names, habitat classifications, deposition types, sensitivity assessments, and justification fields.
  - Metadata, provenance, and transparency
    - Explicit mappings between EUNIS classes, Broad Habitats, NVC codes, and APIS feature names to assign appropriate critical loads/levels.
    - Justifications for each linkage and sensitivity assessments are documented to ensure traceability and auditability.
    - Uses established scientific sources (Noordwijkerhout 2010 Noordwijkerhout Expert Workshop, UNECE, CLRTAP, WHO) and expert judgments from statutory bodies (English Nature/Natural England, SNH, CEH).
  - Data quality and curation
    - Combines empirical data with expert judgment; clearly records uncertainties and potential positive/negative effects of eutrophication.
    - Quality control performed by multiple conservation bodies; transparent handling of exceptions where no suitable EUNIS match exists.
  - Data models and standards
    - Standardized interfaces between habitat features and their critical loads/levels via a structured CSV schema.
    - Field-level alignment across datasets to enable cross-site comparability (e.g., INTERESTCODE, INTERESTNAME, NVC_CODE, BROAD_HABITATCODE, CLMIN_NUTN, CLMAX_NUTN, AMMONIA_NOX_SOX values, etc.).
    - Linking across multiple classification systems (EUNIS, NVC, Broad Habitats) to ensure consistent terminology and interoperability.
  - Data access, sharing, and discoverability
    - Data are documented with metadata describing fields and data structure; example dataset fields are enumerated for transparency.
    - Resource locators provided for contextual background and data sources (APIS, APIS_SAC/SPA/SSSI linkage datasets).
  - Data lifecycle and updates
    - Methodology supports updating critical loads/levels as new science or policy guidance emerges.
    - Provides a framework to handle site-by-site assessments and non-matches (exceptions), ensuring the dataset remains current and defensible.

  - Linkages and classifications
    - Critical loads/levels are linked to designated features via habitat correspondence (EUNIS, NVC, Broad Habitats)
    - Distinctions made for nutrients (NOx, NH3) and acidity (SOx) with species- and habitat-level considerations
    - Where a direct linkage to bird or non-plant species is inappropriate, linkage is inferred from habitat integrity and potential impacts on breeding/feeding/roosting

- Methodology and decision logic relevant to governance
  - Phased assignment process
    - Phase 1: Annex I habitat features and Annex II plant species features (in situ viewpoint)
    - Phase 2: SPA bird features and Annex II non-plant species features (habitat-based assessment for species)
    - Phase 3: A/SSSI habitat features
  - Assessment and justification
    - Uses empirical critical loads where possible; documents sensitivity to eutrophication and acidification
    - Applies expert judgments where direct data are lacking; records assumptions and potential uncertainties
    - Provides explicit criteria (habitat type, sensitivity, potential impacts) to justify critical load/level allocations
  - Exceptions and non-matches
    - Acknowledges cases where no suitable EUNIS class exists; indicates site-by-site assessments or further investigations as needed
  - Quality control and review
    - Expert reviews and cross-validation by statutory bodies and CEH to ensure consistency and credibility
  - Documentation and transparency
    - Justifications, caveats, and possible positive effects of eutrophication are captured to support reproducibility and audit trails

- Practical implications for Data Stewards
  - Ensure alignment of datasets with international/national classification standards and internal taxonomy
  - Maintain rigorous metadata and field-level descriptions to enable discoverability and reuse
  - Implement versioning and change control to track updates to critical loads/levels and associated justifications
  - Facilitate data sharing with stakeholders while preserving provenance and sources
  - Plan for handling data gaps, non-matches, and site-specific assessments within governance workflows
