# Hourly physical and nutrient monitoring data for The Cut, Berkshire (2009-2012) - Supporting Information

- Scope
  - Hourly physical and nutrient monitoring data for The Cut at Bray Marina, Berkshire, UK (grid reference SU915786) from May 2010 to February 2012.
  - Measured parameters: total reactive phosphorus (TRP), total phosphorus (TP), ammonium (NH4), conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, chlorophyll.
  - Accompanied hourly flow data from the Environment Agency flow gauging station on The Cut at Binfield (approx. 10 km upstream).

- Monitoring instrumentation and setup
  - In situ high-frequency instruments: Hach Lange Sigmatax and Phosphax Sigma; YSI 6600 sonde.
  - Located in a trailer 5 m from the riverbank; continuous flow from river centre to a flow cell for analysis.
  - Phosphax Sigma analyzes TP and TRP using acid persulphate digestion (TP) and phosphomolybdenum blue chemistry (TRP); detection limit 0.01 mg P L-1; automated daily calibration; no filtration step.
  - YSI 6600 measures in situ DO, pH, water temperature, conductivity, turbidity (NTU), and chlorophyll (μg/L) via fluorometer (470 nm).
  - Temperature control: trailer heated to 20°C to ensure consistent reaction conditions and prevent frozen pipes.

- Data collection specifics
  - Frequency: hourly measurements; turbidity and chlorophyll measured with corrections for sediment interference; calibration every 2–3 weeks by EA staff following SOPs.
  - Turbidity: measured by light scattering at 830–890 nm; chlorophyll reported as total chlorophyll (a, b, c).
  - Interference handling: chlorophyll readings correlated with turbidity data to account for sediment interference.
  - Flow data: 15-minute flow observations aggregated to hourly averages from Binfield gauging station.

- Data format and units
  - Date/time format: day/month/year hour: minute.
  - Flow: hourly average in cubic metres per second (m³/s).
  - Spatial references: Bray site grid SU915786; Binfield station grid SU853713.
  - Concentrations: TP and TRP expressed as mg P L-1; NH4 expressed as mg N L-1.
  - Turbidity: NTU; Chlorophyll: μg L-1.
  - Missing data: NaN indicates missing data points.

- Temporal and scholarly context
  - Primary dataset period: May 2010 – February 2012.
  - Supporting information linked to works focusing on hydrochemical processes and high-frequency monitoring in lowland/urban catchments (cited papers from 2012 and 2015).

- Data quality, metadata and governance considerations
  - Comprehensive instrumentation and methods documentation enabling reproducibility and quality assurance.
  - Regular calibration and adherence to standard operating procedures; explicit notes on potential interference and corrections.
  - Data described with explicit units, references, and location metadata to support integration into monitoring frameworks.
  - While not explicit about data-sharing permissions in this summary, the dataset provides detailed metadata and methodological transparency to facilitate governance, evaluation, and decision-making under monitoring frameworks.
