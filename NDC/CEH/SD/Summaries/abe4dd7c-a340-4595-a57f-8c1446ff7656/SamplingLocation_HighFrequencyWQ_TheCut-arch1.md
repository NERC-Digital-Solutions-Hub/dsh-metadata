- Data gaps and next steps for analysts
  - The document does not provide actual measurements, coordinates, sampling frequency, or parameter lists.
  - To enable analysis, obtain precise site coordinates, temporal data (dates), measured variables (e.g., nutrient concentrations, turbidity, flow), and data accessibility/metadata.
  - Consider harmonizing data across sites and incorporating metadata (units, methods, QA/QC) for robust comparisons.
