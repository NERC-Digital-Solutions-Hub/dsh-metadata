# Hourly physical and nutrient monitoring data for The Cut, Berkshire (2009-2012) - Supporting Information. April 2015.

- Overview
  - Location: The Cut at Bray Marina, Berkshire, UK (National grid reference SU915786)
  - Time period: May 2010 to February 2012
  - Parameters: total phosphorus (TP), total reactive phosphorus (TRP), ammonium (NH4 as N), conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll
  - Flow data: hourly averages from the Environment Agency flow gauging station The Cut at Binfield (upstream ~10 km), station reference SU853713
  - Data granularity: hourly water quality measurements; 15-minute flow data averaged to hourly values

- Monitoring setup and methods
  - Instruments: Hach Lange Sigmatax and Phosphax Sigma with a YSI 6600 sonde
  - Installation: in Bray trailer unit 5 m from the riverbank; continuous pumping from river centre to a flow cell
  - Sample handling: 10 ml sub-sample transferred to Phosphax Sigma after homogenisation by Sigmatax
  - Analytes and methods:
    - TP and TRP quantified via colorimetric methods after acid persulphate digestion (TP) and phosphomolybdenum blue complexation (TRP)
  - Detection and calibration:
    - Detection limit: 0.01 mg P L-1 for TP and TRP
    - Phosphax Sigma calibration: automated daily
    - YSI 6600 sensors: calibrated every 2–3 weeks per SOPs
  - Temperature and filtration:
    - Trailer heated to 20 °C to maintain reaction temperatures
    - No filtration step in analysis
  - Interference and data handling:
    - Chlorophyll readings can be affected by sediment; corrections informed by comparison with turbidity data
  - Data generation:
    - Sigmatax flow cell and YSI sensor provide hourly measurements; flow data captured from 15-minute intervals

- Data format and units
  - Date/time format: day/month/year hour:minute
  - Flow: hourly average of 15-minute upstream flows; units: cubic metres per second (m3/s)
  - TP and TRP: mg/L (phosphorus as P)
  - Ammonium: mg/L as N
  - Turbidity: NTU (nephelometric turbidity units)
  - Chlorophyll: μg/L (total chlorophyll A, B, and C)
  - Location references: Bray monitoring site SU915786; upstream flow station SU853713
  - Missing data: NaN indicates missing values

- Data quality and provenance
  - Regular quality assurance activities:
    - Daily automated calibration of Phosphax Sigma
    - Periodic (2–3 week) calibration of YSI sondes
  - Documentation and methods are described in the accompanying references and supporting information
