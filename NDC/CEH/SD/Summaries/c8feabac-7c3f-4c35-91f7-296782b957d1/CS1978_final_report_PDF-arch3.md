# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

- Overview
  - Long-term, large-scale land-cover and landscape feature monitoring dataset for Great Britain, with repeated surveys since 1977/78.
  - 1978 data rescue digitally converts 256 annotated land-cover maps into GIS format, enabling analysis of Broad Habitat stock back to 1978 and extending the time series for 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007.
  - Purpose: to enable stock and change estimates of Broad Habitats, correlate with plant species and soil data, and support ecological and policy-oriented monitoring.

- Data Rescue and Digitization Process
  - Physical records from 1978 were digitized to produce a GIS dataset, stored at CEH Lancaster.
  - Digitization performed by ADAS in summer 2009 following established protocol; maps converted to digital line work and linked to Broad Habitats.
  - Maps and plot data scanned and archived in field assessment booklet boxes; digital backups created (jpg, pdf).
  - 1978 field codes mapped to BAP Broad Habitats; consistency checks performed against later years.

- Data Checking and Validation
  - Initial checks for omissions, digitizing errors, and inconsistencies with original field maps.
  - Each survey year’s data organized per 1 km square to compare 1978 with 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007.
  - Spatial anonymization of square locations to protect scientific integrity.
  - Visual and data-driven checks with species data to confirm real changes versus artefacts; concluded 1978 data quality and consistency are comparable with other CS datasets.

- Broad Habitat Allocations and Issues
  - Majority of 1978 codes translated straightforwardly to Broad Habitats; some categories were ambiguous (e.g., Mixed Upland Moor).
  - Resolution of ambiguities used original annotated maps and vegetation plots; visual checks per square conducted.
  - Noted complexities in upland code allocations, potential mosaic classifications, and reclassification of certain habitats in later surveys.
  - Some habitat codes (e.g., Calcareous Grassland vs. Acid Grassland vs. Dwarf Shrub Heath) required cross-reference with plot data for correct Allocation.
  - Priority Habitats (Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture) identifiable where data permitted.

- Land Classification Framework and Evolution
  - 1978 relied on original ITE Land Classification with a 15 x 15 km grid; 6,039 squares classified for national estimates (1215 central squares plus surrounding).
  - 1980s–1990s: All Squares classifications introduced; Scotland and Wales separated in later revisions.
  - 1998 and 2007 updates expanded classes (40 then 45); national estimates recomputed using updated classifications.
  - National stock estimates calculated as mean habitat per square within a Land Class × area of that Land Class; then summed across GB.
  - Appendix II provides Habitat Code Lookup; Appendix III outlines evolution of Land Classification.

- Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978
  - Provides GB-wide stock estimates for a selected set of Broad Habitats (not all directly comparable to later years due to classification changes).
  - 1978 results use the 1990 Land Classification for comparability with that framework; notes limited 256-sample squares and lack of 45-class resolution for direct comparability with 2007.
  - Detailed table of stock (mean area and 95% limits) by habitat (e.g., Broadleaved/Mixed/Yew Woodland, Coniferous Woodland, Arable/Horticulture, Improved Grassland, Neutral Grassland, Calcareous Grassland, Acid Grassland, Bracken, Dwarf Shrub Heath, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Bog, Standing Water, Rivers, Inland Rock, Urban, etc.).
  - Total area and percentage of GB provided; urban areas treated as a constant value for certain estimates.
  - Notes on comparability cautions and methodological differences when aligning 1978 with later years.

- Notes on Comparisons with Previous Publications
  - New digitized 1978 results differ from Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993); differences largely due to:
    - Use of different Land Classifications (1978 vs. All Squares 1990; 32 vs. 40–45 classes).
    - Ambiguities in 1978 polygon allocations and retrospective edits for consistency.
    - Boundary between habitat categories and reclassification in later datasets.
  - Specific habitat notes explain instances where prior published values fall outside the new dataset’s limits (e.g., Boundary/Linear Features, Arable/Horticulture, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Urban).

- Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
  - Demonstrates how historical data rescue expands monitoring capabilities, enabling long-term trend analysis and baseline creation for policy evaluation.
  - Highlights importance of:
    - Clear, consistent data provenance and documentation (field codes, classifications, and reclassifications).
    - Rigorous cross-year validation to distinguish real ecological change from methodological artefacts.
    - Transparent handling of classification changes and their impact on comparability.
    - Data governance considerations for sharing metadata and datasets, and for maintaining data quality and update cycles.
  - Provides a template for integrating legacy maps with modern GIS workflows, supporting future analyses (e.g., landscape changes, habitat stock assessments, and linkage with species and soil data).
