# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

## Overview
- Long-term, large-scale GB land-cover dataset created from Countryside Survey field records (1977/78, 1984, 1990, 1998/99, 2007).
- 1978 primary maps had not been digitised; rescuing the data adds a new historical dimension to the time series, enabling analysis back to 1978.
- Digitisation creates GIS-ready data to enable retrospective analysis of Broad Habitats and their relation to plant species and soil data.
- Data rescue expands the time series for estimating habitat stock and change across 30 years, improving reliability of ecological trend analyses.

## Data and Sources
- Primary source: 256 annotated 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps (linework previously non-digital).
- Related data: 1978 field codes linked to BAP Broad Habitats; species data and vegetation plots used to clarify allocations.
- Outputs include digital maps, plot data sheets, and a GIS repository at CEH Lancaster; scans and maps stored in field assessment booklet boxes.

## Digitization Procedure
- Maps scanned (jpg and pdf); original maps securely stored.
- Digitisation conducted by ADAS in 2009 following established protocol; linework aligned with CEH GIS standards.
- Data stored within a GIS system at CEH Lancaster; access prepared for cross-year analyses.

## Data Checking and Validation
- Initial QA: check for omissions, queries, and digitising errors against original maps.
- Cross-year validation: each survey square compiled per year; comparisons with 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007 to identify real changes versus error.
- Visual checks by colleagues from the 1978 survey to ensure changes reflect genuine ecological change.
- Data treated to prevent disclosure of precise square locations.

## Broad Habitat Allocations (1978)
- Most 1978 codes translated straightforwardly to Broad Habitats; some ambiguous categories required review using habitat maps and vegetation data.
- Key ambiguities and resolutions:
  - Upland codes are difficult to delineate; mosaics may be defined in later surveys.
  - Code 23 Herb-rich pasture could map to Calcareous Grassland, Acid Grassland, or Dwarf Shrub Heath; resolved with plot data where possible.
  - Inland Rock overestimation due to mapping method changes between primary and secondary coding in later years.
  - Some 1978 mappings to Neutral/Improved Grassland not straightforward; resolved with supporting vegetation data.
- 1978 allocations also identified some Priority Habitats (Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture) where identifiable.

## ITE Land Classifications
- 1978 used original ITE Land Classification with a 15 x 15 km grid (1215 classified squares; 6039 squares when surrounding areas were included).
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create a broader set of classes, resulting in a large cross-year dataset.
- National habitat area estimates for 1978 derived by applying mean habitat per square within Land Classes to the area of each Class.
- Over time, classification evolved (All Squares, then refined, with Scotland and Wales treated separately in later years).

## Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978
- Provides stock estimates for a selection of Broad Habitats; results are not directly comparable to 2007 due to:
  - Use of 1990 ITE Land Classification (32 classes) for 1978 estimates versus 2007’s 45 classes.
  - Retrospective allocations may differ from later datasets.
- Example stock highlights (GB-wide, approximate areas in thousands of hectares and percent of GB):
  - Arable and Horticulture: ~5105 (21.9%)
  - Improved Grassland: ~5188 (22.3%)
  - Coniferous Woodland: ~1413
  - Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodland: ~995
  - Bog: ~2004
  - Dwarf Shrub Heath: ~1677
  - Urban: ~1441
  - Other notable categories include Neutral Grassland, Acid Grassland, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, and Standing Water.
- Urban and unsurveyed urban areas treated as separate constants or surrogates in estimation.

## Comparison with Previously Published Data (1984, 1990)
- New digitised results differ from Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993) due to:
  - Differences in Broad Habitat reporting classes and aggregation schemes.
  - Variations in 1978 polygon allocations to Broad Habitats.
  - Use of revised All Squares Land Classification (1990) versus the original 1978 classification in earlier publications.
- The 1978 results more closely align with Barr et al. (1993) due to consistent 1990 All Squares framework, with some expected residual differences.
- Specific habitat notes:
  - Boundary/Linear Features: newer estimates likely higher for smaller habitats due to classification methods.
  - Arable and Horticulture: newer mean area larger; earlier estimates may underestimate some classes.
  - Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Acid/Calcareous Grasslands, and Urban: comparisons sensitive to definitional differences across publications.
- The report emphasizes that direct trend analysis from 1978 to later years requires careful consideration of classification changes.

## Practical Implications for Data Support
- Provides a robust, digitised 1978 baseline enabling long-term habitat trend analysis when integrated with later Countryside Survey years.
- The digitised 1978 dataset supports cross-year analyses of habitat stock, landscape change, and land-use impacts on ecological variation.
- Challenges addressed include data consistency, potential mapping bias, and quality assurance across a multi-decade dataset.
- Outputs offer potential for self-service data exploration via GIS, time-series visualization, and habitat-change dashboards, with documentation on classification decisions and data limitations.
