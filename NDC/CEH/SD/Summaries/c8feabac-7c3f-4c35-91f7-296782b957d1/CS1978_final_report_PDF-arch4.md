# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

## Overview
- Describes the digitisation and data rescue of the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps to enable a long-term GB time series of Broad Habitat data (1978–2007).
- Establishes a digital, GIS-ready dataset for 1978 to compare with later survey years and to study habitat stock, change, and drivers of ecological variation.

## Scope and Significance for Data Leaders
- Creates a globally unique long-term monitoring dataset by adding 1978 data to existing 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007 records.
- Enables analysis of habitat mosaics, plant species, and soil data (pH, LOI) aligned with Broad Habitat categories.
- Enhances data continuity, discoverability (GIS-based storage at CEH Lancaster), and potential for cross-year analytical work.

## Data Rescue and Digitisation
- Primary sources held as hard copies; 256 annotated 1978 maps were digitised into GIS for the first time (2009).
- Maps scanned to .jpg/.pdf; digitised following the CS1978 data rescue protocol; stored in CEH Lancaster GIS.
- Plot data sheets also scanned; original maps moved to secure storage; ongoing back-ups created.

## History and Background
- Builds on earlier smaller surveys (1975–1978, Shetland) and expands to eight vegetation plots per 1 km square, later adjusted to improve habitat mapping.
- Early field codes (up to 80) mapped to Broad Habitats (per Jackson 2000) and, where possible, to Priority Habitats.
- Creates a link between 1978 field observations and later habitat classifications.

## Methodology
- Broad Habitat Allocations: 1978 field codes translated to Broad Habitat categories; ambiguous cases resolved using habitat maps and vegetation plot data; visual square-level checks performed.
- Land Classification: Uses ITE Land Classification framework (initially 1215 squares; ISA analysis to derive 6039 classifications; later revisions to “All Squares” and then more detailed regional classifications).
- Cross-Year Comparisons: 1978 dataset assessed against 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007 data to verify changes and consistency.

## Data Checking and Validation
- Initial quality checks against original field maps to correct omissions or digitising errors.
- Cross-year validation: each survey square mapped per year and evaluated for real change vs. error, aided by staff familiar with the 1978 survey.
- Figures show consistency with later surveys; line work for 1978 kept distinct but shown to be highly consistent with other years after validation.

## Data Products and Metadata
- GIS-based dataset stored at CEH Lancaster; linked to appendices including habitat code lookups and summaries.
- Appendix II provides a habitat code lookup table (mapping 1978 codes to Broad Habitats).
- Appendix III summarizes the ITE Land Classification evolution, enabling traceable data lineage.

## Results: National Estimates for 1978
- Provides stock estimates for a subset of Broad Habitats in Great Britain (not all years directly comparable due to classification changes).
- Key caveats:
  - 1978 estimates use the 1990 Land Classification (32 classes) rather than the 2007 45-class scheme, limiting direct comparability.
  - Some habitats may not map cleanly across years; some adjustments were made to align with later data where feasible.
- Example results (mean areas in 000s ha; percent GB area) include:
  - Arable and Horticulture: around 5,105 (21.9%)
  - Improved Grassland: around 5,188 (22.3%)
  - Coniferous Woodland: around 1,413 (6.1%)
  - Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland: around 995 (4.3%)
  - Other classes include Neutral Grassland, Acid Grassland, Bog, Dwarf Shrub Heath, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Urban, and more, each with lower and upper confidence bounds.
- Caution: these figures are not directly comparable with 2007 figures; intended as a baseline for future time-series work.

## Comparisons with Previously Published Data
- New digitised 1978 results differ from Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993) due to:
  - Different Broad Habitat reporting classes and refinements in land classification over time.
  - Allocation challenges for certain 1978 codes (e.g., upland/mosaic categories).
  - Use of the revised 1990 All Squares Land Classification versus the original 1978 classification in older publications.
- Some discrepancies highlighted and explained (e.g., Boundary/Linear Features, Arable and Horticulture, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Urban).

## Notes on Specific Habitats
- Ambiguities in upland and some grassland categories required careful reallocation using available species and vegetation data.
- Some 1978 categories (e.g., Inland Rock, Urban) were affected by changes in classification and mapping conventions over time.
- Priority Habitats (Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture) were identifiable where data allowed.

## Implications and Learnings for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates robust data rescue, preservation, and the value of digitising historical records for continuity in long-term datasets.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Clear, documented data lineage and codebooks (Appendix II and Appendix III).
  - Consistency checks and cross-year validation to ensure data quality.
  - Transparent handling of classification changes to maintain traceability and reproducibility.
- Underlines challenges of cross-era comparability and the need for careful interpretation when integrating legacy data with newer schemas.

## Limitations and Considerations
- Limited sample size in 1978 (256 squares) affects generalisability and class-level precision.
- Retrospective allocation to newer Land Classifications introduces potential biases in direct year-to-year change calculations.
- Some habitat categories remain difficult to resolve consistently across time due to heterogeneity and evolving classifications.
