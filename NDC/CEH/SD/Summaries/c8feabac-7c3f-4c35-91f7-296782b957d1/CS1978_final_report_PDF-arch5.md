# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

- Purpose and significance
  - Documents the digitisation and rescue of the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps to create a usable GIS-based dataset.
  - Extends the Countryside Survey time series back to 1978, enabling analysis of habitat stock and change across 30 years and linking vegetation, soils, and plant species data.
  - Facilitates cross-year analyses by translating 1978 field codes into Broad Habitats (and to some Priority Habitats) for comparability with later surveys (1984, 1990, 1998, 2007).

- Data governance and provenance
  - Primary source records (hard copies) were at risk of damage or loss; data rescue digitised maps and plot data sheets.
  - Maps and plots scanned and archived; digitisation performed by ADAS in 2009; stored in a GIS at CEH Lancaster.
  - Documentation includes methodology for mapping and code crosswalks (Appendix II: Habitat Code Lookup; Appendix III: Summary of ITE Land Classification).

- Data products and formats
  - Digital maps of 1978 land-cover with 256 1-km survey squares digitised to align with later years’ line work.
  - Scanned originals provided in .jpg and .pdf; GIS-based vector/ raster representations stored at CEH Lancaster.
  - 1978 field codes mapped to Broad Habitats (with some ambiguities resolved via species plots and map evidence).

- Data checking, validation, and quality assurance
  - Initial checks for omissions and digitising errors; anomalies corrected by reference to original maps.
  - Cross-year consistency checks: each square across 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007 laid out on dedicated sheets to identify real changes versus errors.
  - Visual and data-driven validation confirmed 1978 data quality and consistency with other Countryside Survey datasets, enabling reliable change detection.

- Broad Habitat allocations and classification notes
  - Most 1978 codes translated to Broad Habitats (e.g., Conifer Woodland to BH 2) with careful review for ambiguous categories (e.g., Mixed Upland Moor).
  - Notable ambiguities and their treatment:
    - Upland codes and mosaic habitats; some areas treated as Mosaic in later surveys.
    - Certain grassland and upland categories required cross-referencing vegetation plots and maps.
    - Inland rock and boundary/linear features sensitive to method (lines vs area) and primary vs secondary coding differences.
  - Priority Habitats (Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture) identifiable where data allowed.

- ITE Land Classification context
  - 1978 used the original ITE Land Classification (15 x 15 km squares with 1215 confirmed classifications; additional squares classified nearby).
  - National estimates calculated by leveraging Land Class means per square class and area-weighting; later Land Classification revisions (1990 All Squares) influenced comparability.

- Results and comparability
  - National stock estimates for 1978 provided for key Broad Habitats, but cautions apply:
    - Not directly comparable to 2007 results due to differences in Land Classification (32 vs 45 classes) and retrospective habitat allocations.
    - Some differences with earlier publications (Bunce & Heal 1984; Barr et al. 1993) arise from classification changes, coding decisions, and use of original vs revised all-squares classifications.
  - Tables in the report present 1978 habitat stocks (in thousands of hectares) and percentages, illustrating habitat distribution and changes within the 30-year window.

- Notable limitations and challenges
  - Some Broad Habitat categories are difficult to delineate, especially upland mosaics and interpretive categories.
  - Ambiguities in translating 1978 codes to later Broad Habitats can affect direct historical comparisons.
  - Limited sample size (256 squares) influences the stability of national estimates for smaller habitat classes.
  - Urban and other land classifications required adjustments (e.g., unsurveyed urban treated as a constant value in later analyses).

- Implications for data governance and stewarding
  - Demonstrates effective data rescue: preserving historic data, enabling reproducible cross-year analyses, and maintaining rigorous QA.
  - Highlights the importance of transparent coding schemes, detailed metadata, and crosswalks between older and newer classifications to support discoverability and reuse.
  - Emphasizes careful interpretation when integrating legacy data with newer frameworks due to methodological and classification changes.

- Appendices and supporting resources
  - Appendix II: Habitat Code Lookup Table (maps 1978 codes to Broad Habitat allocations; cross-references to Arable/Horticulture classifications).
  - Appendix III: Summary of the ITE Land Classification (historical context and evolution).
  - Maps illustrating Broad Habitat stock as percentages by Land Class; documentation of classification decisions and notes on ambiguities.
  - Reference materials and prior data rescue/scanning work for context and methodological lineage.

- Practical guidance for users
  - Treat 1978 results as a foundational historical snapshot with careful caveats about comparability to later years.
  - Use the 1978 dataset alongside 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007 datasets with appropriate classification harmonization and explicit acknowledgement of methodological differences.
  - Leverage the code lookup and habitat allocation notes to map 1978 data to Broad Habitats in harmonized analyses.
  - Consider uncertainties in upland and mosaic classifications when interpreting habitat change trajectories.
