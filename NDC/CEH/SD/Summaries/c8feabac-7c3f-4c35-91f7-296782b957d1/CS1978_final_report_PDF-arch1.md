# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

- Aimed to rescue and digitize the 1978 Countryside Survey field records to create a GIS-friendly, long-term dataset for analyzing land-cover and Broad Habitat change across Great Britain over 30 years.
- Enables comparison with later surveys (1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) and strengthens the time-series used to estimate habitat stock and drivers of ecological variation.

## Data Rescue and Digitization

- Primary records (1978 land-cover maps) were at risk of damage and not stored in a readily usable spatial form.
- 1978 maps digitized in 2009 by ADAS; maps stored in a GIS at CEH Lancaster; scanned originals and plot sheets preserved.
- Digitization adds 1978 as a matched dataset with later surveys, extending the series back to the post-WWII agricultural intensification era.

## History and Background

- 1978 followed earlier Cumbria work and a Shetland survey, expanding to eight randomly located vegetation plots per 1 km square (reduced to five with additional habitat plots for rivers, roads, hedges).
- Field maps were initially sketches and later transferred to base maps using 80 codes; these were later translated to Broad Habitats (BH) under Jackson (2000).
- Enables mosaic-level habitat characterization alongside coincident plant species and soil data.

## Issues Addressed Regarding the 1978 Dataset

- Concerns about internal consistency, mapping bias, and QA were addressed by comparing 1978 data with subsequent years.
- Visual checks and cross-year comparisons indicated real change could be distinguished; bias acknowledged but considered consistent across digitization.
- Dataset shown to be robust and suitable for integration with other Countryside Survey data.

## Digitization Procedure

- Maps scanned (jpg/pdf); original maps removed to fire safety; digitization performed in summer 2009; data stored in a GIS at CEH Lancaster.

## Data Checking and Validation

- Initial checks for omissions/errors from digitizing; anomalies corrected.
- Squares for 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007 laid out on sheets to compare year-to-year changes while protecting square locations (spatial masking).
- Validation with staff involved in the 1978 survey to confirm whether changes were real or artefacts.

## Broad Habitat Allocations

- 1978 field codes translated to BH; ambiguous cases resolved using original habitat maps and vegetation plot data; visual checks conducted for each square.
- Key issues:
  - Upland codes are difficult to delineate; mosaic treatments may be used in complex landscapes.
  - Herb-rich pasture coded as Calcareous Grassland; cross-checked with plots to assign correctly.
  - Inland Rock overestimation due to coding practice differences between 1978 and later years.
  - 1978 translations to Neutral/Improved Grassland not always straightforward.
  - 1984/1990 line-work conventions influenced later datasets to maintain comparability; 1978 line-work was digitized independently but aligned after review.
- Some Priority Habitats identifiable (Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture).

## Note Regarding the ITE Land Classifications

- 1978 used original ITE Land Classification (15 x 15 km squares; 1215 classified, plus surrounding squares).
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) defined a 6,039-square framework for national estimates.
- Later revisions (All Squares) refined classifications and enabled more detailed national estimates; Scotland and Wales reporting evolved in 1998 and 2007 respectively.
- National estimates for 1978 are calculated using the 1990 ITE Land Classification (32 classes) due to sample size and comparability constraints; direct comparisons to 2007 classifications are limited.

## Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978

- Provides GB-wide stock estimates for selected Broad Habitats, with means and 95% limits (in thousands of hectares) and percent area of GB.
- Key examples (illustrative, not exhaustive):
  - Arable and Horticulture: ~5,105 thousand ha (about 21.9% of GB)
  - Improved Grassland: ~5,188 thousand ha (about 22.3%)
  - Neutral Grassland: ~1,442 thousand ha (about 6.2%)
  - Coniferous Woodland: ~1,413 thousand ha (about 6.1%)
  - Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodland: ~995 thousand ha (about 4.3%)
  - Dwarf Shrub Heath: ~1,677 thousand ha (about 7.2%)
  - Bog: ~2,004 thousand ha (about 8.6%)
  - Urban areas: ~1,441 thousand ha (about 6.2%)
  - Total area: ~23,313 thousand ha (GB total)
- Notes:
  - Estimates are not directly comparable to 2007 results due to differences in classification schemes and sample sizes.
  - Limited sample size (256 squares) and reliance on 32-class land classification affect comparability and precision.

## Comparability with Previously Published Data

- New results differ from Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993) due to:
  - Different Broad Habitat aggregations and reporting classes used in earlier publications.
  - Reclassification from the 1978 ITE framework to the revised All Squares framework (1990) and subsequent updates.
  - In some cases, the 1978 codes were difficult to map exactly to later BH classes, leading to edits for consistency.
- Expect some alignment with Barr et al. (1993) for Scotland/Wales adjustments; Bunce & Heal (1984) used older classification and shows systematic differences.

## Notes on Specific Habitats

- Boundary/Linear Features: newer estimates tend to be lower than earlier published values due to revised classification.
- Arable and Horticulture: higher in new digitized data; older estimates may have overestimation due to differing classifications.
- Acid Grassland, Dwarf Shrub Heath, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Bog: comparability is challenged by evolving habitat definitions and reporting classes.
- Urban: older Bunce & Heal values included unsurveyed urban; later analyses treated unsurveyed urban as a constant value, affecting comparisons.

## Data Access and Usage for Analysts

- Digitized 1978 data added a new temporal dimension to the Countryside Survey series, enabling cross-year analyses of habitat stock and change.
- Data and maps are stored in a GIS at CEH Lancaster; metadata and documentation accompany datasets.
- Users should account for classification changes and sample size limitations when modeling 1978-to-later-year changes.
- The dataset supports integration with other years to study drivers of ecological variation, land-use change, and habitat dynamics across GB.
