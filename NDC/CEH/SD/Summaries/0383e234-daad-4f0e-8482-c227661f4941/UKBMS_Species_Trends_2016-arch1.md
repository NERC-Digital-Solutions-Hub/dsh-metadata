# Experimental design/sampling regime

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) collects data from over 2,000 sites annually across the UK, primarily using fixed Pollard walk transects to estimate butterfly abundance.
- All-species transects
  - Fixed-route line transect at each site, recording all butterflies along a 5 m wide belt, typically 2–4 km long.
  - Counts occur weekly from April to September (ideally 26 counts per year) under suitable weather (dry, wind < Beaufort 5, temperature thresholds).
  - Transects are fixed to allow year-to-year comparison; divided into habitat/management sections.
- Single-species transects
  - Follow the same methodology as all-species transects but record only for specific focal weeks.
- Timed counts and egg/larval web counts
  - Timed counts: abundance of a focal species over a set time in a defined area, under weather constraints.
  - Egg/larval web counts: counting eggs or larval webs in suitable habitat areas.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS)
  - Established in 2009 to sample wider countryside habitats with reduced effort.
  - Two parallel 1-km transects inside randomly selected 1-km squares; 2–4 visits per year, minimum 2 visits in July/August, spring visits encouraged.
- Data collection and entry
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online via UKBMS MyData or Transect Walker software.
  - Transect coordinators compile region data; online and Transect Walker files are uploaded to an Oracle database.
- Analytical methods for national indices
  - WCBS species: two-stage model using all survey data.
    - Stage 1: generalised additive model (GAM) estimates annual seasonal flight pattern.
    - Stage 2: counts are modeled with seasonal values as an offset to estimate annual abundance changes and trends.
    - Described in Dennis et al. 2013.
  - Habitat specialists and regular migrants: GAM-based imputation to derive a site index.
    - Collated Index (CI) is produced by combining site indices; missing values are estimated with a log-linear regression model accounting for year and site effects.
    - A linear regression on collated indices yields trends across the UK since 1976.
  - Trends are calculated for: the full series (1976–2016), the last 20 years (1997–2016), and the last 10 years (2007–2016).
  - Species are categorized as wider countryside, habitat specialists, or regular migrants (with examples like Red Admiral noted).
- Data and trend outputs
  - Collated Indices are log10-transformed; trends are reported as slopes (change per year).
  - Site indices are relative measures, tied to a standard proportion of true population size; Collated Indices are scaled so the average index over the series equals 2.
- Quality control and validation
  - Automatic checks in Transect Walker flag implausible counts or out-of-season records.
  - Regional transect coordinators review data; ongoing validation and automated/manual checks ensure consistency with known distributions and flight periods.
- Data storage format
  - Species Trends stored as CSV with columns including:
    - Sci_Name, Common_name, No_years, Series_slope, Series_Std_Err, Series_P_value, Series_trend, Series_%_change
    - 20_yr_Slope, 20_yr_Std_Err, 20_yr_P_value, 20_yr_Trend, 20_yr_%_change
    - 10_yr_Slope, 10_yr_Std_Err, 10_yr_P_value, 10_yr_Trend, 10_yr_%_change
- Interpretive notes
  - Site indices provide relative population size; the accuracy depends on detectability and flight period alignment.
  - The Collated Index is updated with new data each year, which can slightly adjust past years’ indices.
  - Some early years may lack collated indices for certain species due to insufficient data.
