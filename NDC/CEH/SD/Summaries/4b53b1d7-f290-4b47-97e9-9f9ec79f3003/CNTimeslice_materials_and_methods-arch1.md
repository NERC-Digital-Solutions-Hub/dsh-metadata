# Nitrogen and Carbon isotope data from 210 Pb dated lake sediment cores in the United Kingdom

## Scope and dataset selection
- Dataset includes lake sediment cores with well-resolved chronology and sediment covering 1850 to the present.
- Many UK lakes excluded because 210 Pb dating did not extend far enough or insufficient material for analysis.
- Spatial distribution reflects historical research focus: clustering in NW England, Wales, and Scotland, with broader UK coverage from lowland lakes.

## Dating methods and chronology
- Age/depth intervals determined from 210 Pb and 137 Cs dating, measured by direct gamma assay at the Environmental Radiometric Facility (UCL) and Liverpool University Environmental Radioactivity Research Centre.
- Detection methods:
  - 210 Pb via 46.5 keV gamma emissions.
  - 226 Ra inferred from 214 Pb via 295 keV and 352 keV gamma rays after 3 weeks equilibration.
  - 137 Cs via 662 keV gamma emission.
- Corrections applied for self-absorption of low-energy gamma rays.
- Target time intervals: 1850, 1900, 1980, and present.
- Age-depth calculations are per core; reported in internal ECRC documents.
- Age errors:
  - 1980: ±2/3 years
  - 1900: ±15–20 years
  - 1850: ±15–25 years
- Modern dates derived from the depth just below the surface sample to capture integrated contemporary deposition; typical core collection date median is 1995.
- Data gaps and mismatches:
  - Typically four depth/age measurements per water body, but some lakes have missing intervals due to sediment limitations.
  - Notable incomplete sequences: Llyn Dulyn (missing most recent), Loch Ness (missing 1980 and recent), Lochan Uaine (missing 1980 and recent).
  - Loch Lomond and Loch Shiel have multiple cores/sequences due to size or experimental design.

## Carbon and nitrogen isotope measurement
- Sample preparation:
  - Freeze-dried sediment homogenised by ball milling; ~10–12 mg per tin capsule.
  - No pretreatment to remove inorganic carbonate.
- Isotopic analysis:
  - Total carbon and nitrogen, plus 15N/14N and 13C/12C, measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry at UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility.
  - Instruments: Hydra 20-20 or Anca-GSL IRMS.
  - Sample IDs and analysis IDs assigned during processing; unique IDs recorded.
  - Standards and QA: interspersed replicates and multiple laboratory standards.
- Isotopic notation:
  - δ15N and δ13C expressed in per mille (‰) using delta notation relative to AIR (for nitrogen) and VPDB (for carbon).
  - δ15N(‰) = [(R_sample/R_standard) − 1] × 1000; δ13C(‰) defined similarly.
- Reporting units:
  - Total sediment carbon and nitrogen expressed as grams per gram dry weight (g g−1 DW).

## Data provenance and accessibility
- Data generated through collaboration between ECRC, UCL, Liverpool, and UC Davis; internal age-depth reports archived at ECRC.
- Sample and analysis IDs enable traceability of measurements and QA steps.
- Focused on providing robust, comparable isotope data with transparent chronology for downstream analyses.
