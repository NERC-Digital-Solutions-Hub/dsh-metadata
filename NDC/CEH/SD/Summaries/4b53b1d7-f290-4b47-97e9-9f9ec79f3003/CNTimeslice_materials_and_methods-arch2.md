# Nitrogen and Carbon isotope data from 210 Pb dated lake sediment cores in the United Kingdom.

## Aim and scope
- Provide nitrogen and carbon isotope data from UK lake sediments with well-resolved 210Pb chronologies, covering 1850 to the present.
- Support monitoring of environmental change by delivering consistent, comparable data for policy and health assessments over time.

## Dataset inclusion criteria
- Cores included iteratively based on chronology resolution and the availability of sediment from 1850 to present.
- Some UK lakes excluded due to insufficient 210Pb dating depth range or inadequate sediment for analysis, even if sediments exist in the ECRC archive.
- Spatial distribution reflects historical research focus: clustering in NW England, Wales, and Scotland (upland waters and acidification), with broader UK coverage from lowland lakes through continued research.

## 210 Pb and 137 Cs dating
- Age-depth intervals determined from 210Pb and 137Cs dating measured by direct gamma assay.
- Laboratories: Environmental Radiometric Facility at University College London and Liverpool University Environmental Radioactivity Research Centre.
- Detectors: well-type coaxial low-background intrinsic germanium detectors.
- 210Pb dating via gamma emissions at 46.5 keV; 226Ra via 214Pb gamma rays (295 keV and 352 keV) after 3 weeks sealing for equilibration.
- 137Cs dating via gamma emission at 662 keV.
- Absolute efficiencies calibrated with sources and known-activity sediments; corrections for self-absorption of low-energy gammas.
- Time intervals targeted: 1850, 1900, 1980, and present (modern); age-depth calculations performed per core and reported in internal ECRC reports.
- Age errors increase with depth (unsupported 210Pb half-life is 22.3 years); typical errors:
  - 1980: ±2/3 years
  - 1900: ±15/20 years
  - 1850: ±15/25 years
- Modern date derived from the depth just below the surface sample to integrate contemporary deposition; core collection date median: 1995.
- Some lakes have incomplete sequences (see notable exceptions below).

## Core completeness and lake-specific notes
- Incomplete lake sequences included:
  - Llyn Dulyn, Wales – missing most recent sediment
  - Loch Ness, Scotland – missing 1980 and recent
  - Lochan Uaine, Scotland – missing 1980 and recent
  - (Note: Llyn Dulyn, Wales – missing 1980 and recent appears as a secondary mention in the source)
- Lakes with multiple cores or distinct basins:
  - Loch Lomond – two cores (LOMO3, LOMO4) due to large size and multiple basins
  - Loch Shiel – two core sequences (SHIE2, SHIE5) from the same location but a decade apart to examine diagenesis effects

## Carbon and Nitrogen stable isotope sample measurement
- Sample preparation: freeze-dried sediment homogenised by mechanical ball milling; ~10–12 mg per sample placed in tin capsules; no pre-treatment to remove inorganic carbonate.
- Isotope analysis conducted at the UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility (California, USA) using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) on Hydra 20-20 or Anca-GSL systems.
- Quality control: samples interspersed with several replicates of at least two different laboratory standards; analysis IDs and sample IDs assigned during processing and recorded.
- Isotopic notation and standards:
  - δ15N and δ13C expressed in per mil (‰) using delta notation.
  - δ15N standard: atmospheric nitrogen (AIR); δ13C standard: Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB).
- Concentrations: total sediment Carbon and Nitrogen expressed as g-1 dry weight (DW) of sample.

## Data structure and identifiers
- Each sample and analysis has unique identifiers issued during processing (interfacing with UC Davis).
- Data are archived with the ECRC, including internal measurement reports and project records.

## Data management, accessibility, and context
- The dataset integrates long-term isotopic records with established age control to enable assessment of environmental change in UK lakes.
- Archive positioning supports future data reuse and cross-dataset comparisons, enabling broader policies and environmental monitoring applications.
- The approach emphasizes standardized dating and measurement protocols to facilitate reproducibility and comparability across cores and lakes.
