# Nitrogen and Carbon isotope data from 210 Pb dated lake sediment cores in the United Kingdom

## Overview and Scope
- Dataset comprises nitrogen and carbon isotope data from sediment cores in UK lakes, dated using 210 Pb and 137 Cs methods.
- Inclusion driven by having a well-resolved chronology and sediment records from 1850 to present; some lakes are excluded due to dating limits or insufficient material.
- Spatial distribution reflects UK geography and history of ECRC research (upland waters/acidification) with broader coverage in lowland lakes through continued sampling.
- Each water body generally has four depth/age measurements; some lakes have incomplete sequences or multiple cores.

## Chronology, Dating, and Time Intervals
- Age-depth intervals selected from 210 Pb and 137 Cs dating, measured with low-background germanium detectors at UCL and Liverpool facilities.
- 210 Pb dating relies on gamma emissions (46.5 keV for 210 Pb; 295/352 keV for 226 Ra via 214 Pb) after equilibration; 137 Cs measured at 662 keV.
- Time points used: 1850, 1900, 1980, and present; age-depth calculations performed per core, with internal reporting.
- Typical age uncertainties: 1980 ± 2/3 years; 1900 ± 15/20 years; 1850 ± 15/25 years.
- Modern date often derived from the depth just below the surface to capture integrated contemporary signals; core collection date median around 1995.
- Notable gaps/variations: several lakes have missing modern or 1980 data; some lakes have multiple cores from the same location or distinct basins for methodological experiments.

## Isotope Sample Measurement (Nitrogen and Carbon)
- Samples: freeze-dried sediment ground and ~10–12 mg packed in tin capsules for isotope ratio mass spectrometry.
- Analyzed for total nitrogen (N) and carbon (C), plus 15N/14N and 13C/12C ratios.
- Measurement facilities: UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility (California) using Hydra 20-20 or Anca-GSL mass spectrometers.
- Methodology details: samples interspersed with replicates of laboratory standards; no pre-treatment to remove inorganic carbonate.
- Isotopic notation and units: δ15N and δ13C expressed in per mille (‰) relative to AIR and VPDB standards, respectively; total C and N reported as g-1 dry weight.
- Data identifiers: sample IDs and analysis IDs assigned during processing by UC Davis and included in the dataset as unique IDs.

## Data Provenance, Metadata, and Management
- Core dating and age-depth reporting handled by the Environmental Change Research Centre (ECRC) and archived internally at ECRC.
- Detailed lab procedures, corrections (e.g., self-absorption in low-energy gamma rays), and age error estimates are documented in internal reports.
- Multiple laboratories contribute to data generation; explicit documentation of which core belongs to which lake and core sequence is maintained.
- Some inconsistencies in core-to-lake mapping and incomplete lake sequences are acknowledged, with explicit examples.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Gaps
- Uncertainties increase with depth for 210 Pb dating due to the half-life of unsupported 210 Pb.
- Incomplete lake sequences and mismatches between cores and lakes reduce uniformity of time series across sites.
- Some lakes lack recent (1980/present) data or have multiple cores from the same site; diagenesis experiments included in sampling strategy.
- Metadata on data completeness and core provenance is essential for users to assess suitability for specific analyses.

## Access, Availability, and Reuse
- Primary data lineage and measurements are documented in ECRC internal reports; age-depth calculations and related metadata archived at ECRC.
- Isotopic analysis data generated at UC Davis; sample and analysis IDs are recorded for traceability.
- The document outlines data generation and processing but does not specify a public, centralized data repository for direct download; refers to internal archives and facility records.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: from sampling design and chronology establishment to laboratory measurement and metadata capture.
- Highlights importance of clear inclusion criteria, provenance, and error characterization for a multidisciplinary data product.
- Emphasizes need for robust metadata, cross-lab coordination, and transparent handling of data gaps and exceptions to maintain data quality and usability.
- Illustrates data governance challenges in environmental science datasets, including standardization, discoverability, and access across institutions.
