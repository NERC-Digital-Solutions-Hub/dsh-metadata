# Nitrogen and Carbon isotope data from 210 Pb dated lake sediment cores in the United Kingdom

- Purpose: Compile 210 Pb and 137 Cs dated sediment records from UK lakes to derive carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data (δ13C, δ15N) and total C and N contents, enabling reconstruction of environmental change from 1850 to present and informing monitoring and policy decisions.

## Core inclusion and geographic coverage
- Inclusion driven by having a well-resolved chronology and usable sediment from 1850 to present.
- Many UK lakes excluded due to insufficient 210 Pb dating or inadequate depth intervals; some sediments exist in the ECRC archive but were not used for this dataset.
- Spatial pattern shows clustering in NW England, Wales, and Scotland, reflecting historical research focus; broader UK distribution achieved through lowland lake cores.

## Dating methodology (210 Pb and 137 Cs)
- Age/depth intervals determined from 210 Pb and 137 Cs measured by direct gamma assays at the Environmental Radiometric Facility (UCL) and Liverpool University Laboratory.
- Detectors: well-type coaxial low background intrinsic germanium detectors.
- 210 Pb dating: based on 46.5 keV gamma emission; 226 Ra inferred from 214Pb gamma emissions (295 keV and 352 keV) after ~3 weeks equilibration.
- 137 Cs dating: measured at 662 keV.
- Absolute efficiencies established with calibrated sources and known-activity sediments; corrections for self-absorption applied.
- Time points used: 1850, 1900, 1980, and present.
- Age-depth calculations done per core; age errors increase with depth due to the 210 Pb half-life (22.3 years).
- Most recent “modern” date derived from the depth just below the surface to reflect integrated contemporary deposition; typical core-specific date: median collection year ~1995.
- Reported typical age errors: 1980 ± ~2–3 years; 1900 ± 15–20 years; 1850 ± 15–25 years.
- Data gaps and mismatches: some lakes have incomplete sequences (missing recent or earlier intervals) or multiple cores within a lake; examples include Llyn Dulyn (missing recent/1980), Loch Ness (missing 1980/recent), Loch Mor (Loch Lomond with two cores due to basins), Loch Shiel (two sequences from the same location decade apart for diagenesis experiments).

## Carbon and Nitrogen stable isotope measurements
- Sample preparation: freeze-dried sediment milled to homogenate; ~10–12 mg subsamples weighed into tin capsules; no pre-treatment to remove inorganic carbonate.
- Measurement: total C and N, plus 15N/14N and 13C/12C ratios using isotope ratio mass spectrometry.
- Laboratories and instruments: UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility; IRMS instruments Hydra 20-20 or Anca-GSL.
- Data management: unique sample IDs and analysis IDs assigned during processing and included in the dataset.
- Quality control: analyses interspersed with replicates of at least two different laboratory standards.
- Isotopic notation: δ15N (‰) and δ13C (‰) calculated relative to AIR and VPDB standards, respectively.
- Units: Total C and N reported as g per gram dry weight (g-1 DW).
- Notes: samples were not pre-treated to remove inorganic carbonate prior to analysis.

## Data governance, metadata, and accessibility
- Some datasets and age-depth information are stored as internal ECRC reports; age-depth errors and calculations are documented within these internal records.
- Data traceability is maintained through unique IDs for samples and analyses, with archived methodology details and provenance.
- While the dataset emphasizes rigorous dating and QA, publicly shareable metadata availability may be constrained by the reliance on internal reporting and archival records.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- The dataset demonstrates how environmental monitoring data can be built from radiometric dating and stable isotope analyses to track historical environmental change.
- Highlights importance of:
  - Transparent age-depth modelling and explicit uncertainty quantification.
  - Comprehensive metadata, including core selection criteria, dating intervals, and sample processing steps.
  - Data completeness: addressing gaps when lakes have incomplete sequences or missing basins.
  - Data governance and openness: balancing rigorous internal records with accessible public datasets to support policy and decision-making.
- Practical challenges align with common monitoring barriers: data availability, metadata quality, cross-lacustrine comparability, and the need to share underlying data while maintaining provenance and QA.
