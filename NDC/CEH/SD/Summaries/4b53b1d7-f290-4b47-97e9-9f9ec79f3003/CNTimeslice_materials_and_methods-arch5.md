# Nitrogen and Carbon isotope data from 210 Pb dated lake sediment cores in the United Kingdom.

## Overview
- Dataset comprises nitrogen and carbon isotope data from 210Pb dated lake sediment cores in the United Kingdom.
- Inclusion driven by well-resolved chronologies and sediment availability (1850–present); some UK lakes are excluded due to insufficient 210Pb dating depth or material.
- Spatial distribution reflects UK geography and historical research focus; broader UK coverage achieved through continued lowland lake sampling.

## Dataset inclusion and scope
- Cores included when chronology is well resolved and 1850–present sediment intervals are available.
- Excluded lakes include Llyn Dulyn (missing recent sediment), Loch Ness (missing 1980 and recent), Lochan Uaine (missing 1980 and recent), with occasional other gaps.
- Some lakes have multiple cores due to size or experimental aims (e.g., Loch Lomond with two cores LOMO3/LOMO4; Loch Shiel with SHIE2/SHIE5).

## Dating methods and chronology
- Age/depth intervals determined from 210Pb and 137Cs dating; measurements by direct gamma assay.
- Laboratories: Environmental Radiometric Facility, UCL, and Liverpool University Environmental Radioactivity Research Centre.
- Detection: well-type coaxial low-background intrinsic germanium detectors.
- 210Pb dated via 46.5 keV gamma emission; 226Ra via 295 keV and 352 keV gamma emissions from 214Pb after ~3 weeks equilibration.
- 137Cs measured at 662 keV.
- Absolute detector efficiencies calibrated with known activity standards; corrections made for self-absorption in the sample.
- Time intervals used: 1850, 1900, 1980, and present.
- Age-depth calculations are performed per core; age uncertainties increase with depth (1980 ±2/3 years; 1900 ±15/20 years; 1850 ±15/25 years).
- Modern date derived from depth just below surface to capture integrated contemporary signal, with the core collection date median around 1995.
- Note: there is a mismatch between number of cores and number of lakes in some cases due to sediment availability.

## Isotope measurement and processing
- Sample preparation: freeze-dried sediment homogenized by ball mill; ~10–12 mg per tin capsule; no pre-treatment to remove inorganic carbonate.
- Isotopes measured: total carbon and nitrogen; δ15N/δ14N and δ13C/δ12C via isotope ratio mass spectrometry.
- Instrumentation: Hydra 20-20 or Anca-GSL isotope ratio mass spectrometers (UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility, USA).
- Processing workflow: samples interspersed with replicates of lab standards; unique sample and analysis IDs issued and recorded.
- Notation and standards:
  - δ15N and δ13C reported in per mil (‰).
  - δ15N calibrated against atmospheric AIR; δ13C calibrated against Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB).
- Concentration units: total carbon and nitrogen expressed as grams per gram dry weight (g g−1 DW).

## Data quality, provenance, and documentation
- Provenance tracked via core-specific IDs, analysis IDs, and processing records; internal reports archived at the ECRC.
- Explicitly acknowledges measurement uncertainties and the need to interpret results within the context of dating precision and sampling gaps.
- Metadata includes laboratories, detectors, calibration, and correction methods to enable reproducibility and re-use.

## Practical considerations for data stewardship
- Maintain comprehensive metadata for each core (location, lake, core ID, depth/age intervals, gaps).
- Document dating uncertainties and the rationale for chosen time intervals per core.
- Capture cross-lab data lineage (which lab performed dating vs isotope measurements) and any inter-lab calibration notes.
- Clearly flag incomplete lake sequences and cores with missing intervals to guide users and future updates.
- Ensure storage in the central ECRC archive with links to internal reports and analysis IDs, enabling traceability and future updates.
