# Nitrogen and Carbon isotope data from 210 Pb dated lake sediment cores in the United Kingdom.

## Purpose and scope
- Provides carbon and nitrogen isotope data from UK lake sediments with well-resolved chronologies extending from 1850 to the present.
- Sampling emphasizes upland waters and acidification studies, with broader UK coverage achieved through continued lowland lake research.
- Dataset assembled iteratively, prioritising cores with reliable age models; some UK lakes are excluded when 210 Pb dating cannot reach the required depth or material quantity is insufficient.

## Data collection and chronology
- Age/depth intervals are selected from 210 Pb and 137 Cs dating measured by gamma assays at two facilities (ECRC, UCL and Liverpool University Environmental Radioactivity Research Centre).
- Measurement details:
  - 210 Pb dating via gamma emissions at 46.5 keV; 226 Ra via its daughter 214 Pb (after ~3 weeks equilibration).
  - 137 Cs dating via gamma emission at 662 keV.
  - Detector systems: well-type coaxial low-background intrinsic germanium detectors.
  - Absolute detector efficiencies established with calibrated sources and known-activity sediments; self-absorption corrections applied.
- Time intervals used for reporting: 1850, 1900, 1980, and present (modern) date derived from the depth just below the surface sample.
- Core-specific chronological uncertainties:
  - 210 Pb dating errors increase with depth; typical age errors are core-dependent.
  - Present date is aligned with the core collection date (median 1995).
- In practice, each water body is intended to have four depth/age measurements; some lakes are incomplete due to sediment limitations or missing sections.
- Examples of incomplete sequences include Llyn Dulyn (missing most recent), Loch Ness (missing 1980 and recent), Lochan Uaine (missing 1980 and recent); Loch Lomond has two cores, Loch Shiel has two sequences from separate locations for diagenesis testing.

## Isotope measurement and data outputs
- Sample preparation for isotopes:
  - Freeze-dried sediment homogenised by mechanical ball milling.
  - Approximately 10–12 mg of sediment loaded into tin capsules for mass spectrometry.
  - No pre-treatment to remove inorganic carbonate performed.
- Isotope ratio measurement:
  - Total nitrogen and carbon, and isotopic ratios 15N/14N and 13C/12C measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry at UC Davis.
  - Instrument options: Hydra 20-20 or Anca-GSL IRMS.
  - Analyses include interspersed replicates of laboratory standards.
- Notation and standards:
  - δ15N and δ13C expressed as per mille (‰) relative to AIR and VPDB, respectively.
  - δ15N(‰) = [(R_sample/R_standard) − 1] × 1000 and δ13C(‰) defined similarly.
- Units:
  - Total sediment carbon and nitrogen expressed as grams per gram dry weight (g g−1 DW).
- Data identifiers:
  - Each sample has unique IDs and associated analysis IDs issued by UC Davis; these IDs accompany the data and are referenced in processing and archiving.

## Data quality, provenance, and metadata
- Provenance traces:
  - Data originate from ECRC (core collection and initial dating) and UC Davis (isotope measurements).
  - Age-depth reports and core-specific chronology calculations archived in the Environmental Change Research Centre.
- Quality assurance:
  - Calibration against known standards, corrections for self-absorption, and use of replicates and lab standards during isotope analysis.
- Metadata considerations:
  - Core-by-core notes on completeness, lake-specific sampling details, and the presence of multiple cores per water body (where applicable).

## Data management and accessibility considerations
- Not all cores and lakes are fully represented; some outputs exist only in internal reports and are archived at ECRC.
- The dataset supports self-serve analysis for temporal isotope trends (δ13C, δ15N) alongside total C and N, with explicit age control from 210 Pb and 137 Cs dating.
- Users should account for core-specific age uncertainties, incomplete depth intervals, and the potential need to reconcile multiple cores per water body.
