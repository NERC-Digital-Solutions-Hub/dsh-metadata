- Sampling and informants:
  - Respondents chosen for knowledge of disease and accessibility.
  - Aimed to capture a broad picture across three community clusters: (i) long-established Korekore villages; (ii) border villages with abundant tsetse populations and migrant land-seekers; (iii) transitional villages near frontier areas.

- Data handling and storage:
  - Interviews were recorded; transcripts created afterward.
  - Transcripts stored securely at the University of Zimbabwe.
  - To meet Environmental Information Data Centre requirements, transcripts were anonymised and converted from Word to Rich Text Format (RTF).

- Anonymisation and coding:
  - Individual names replaced with non-identifying placeholders; exact dates generalized to less precise dates when necessary.
  - Each interview coded with a letter and number to protect interviewees’ identities.
