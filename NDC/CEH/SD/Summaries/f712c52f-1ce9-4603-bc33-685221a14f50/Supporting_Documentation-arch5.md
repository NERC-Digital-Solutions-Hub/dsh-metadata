# Supporting documentation

- Context and purpose
  - Part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC) research; funded by NERC project NE/J000701/1 with ESPA support.
  - Zimbabwean interdisciplinary team (sociologists, GIS experts, entomologists) collected data on how local people in Mukwichi communal lands of Hurungwe (Chundu Ward) are affected by and respond to tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis.
  - Data contribute to broader research funded under the project and are deposited for sharing and reuse.

- Dataset content
  - Rich text format (RTF) document containing transcripts of key informant interviews.
  - Interviews focus on experiences with tsetse flies, sleeping sickness, and related impacts (agriculture, labor, health).

- Interview design and topics
  - Semi-structured interviews conducted Dec 2012–Aug 2013; no fixed order of questions but covered a broad checklist.
  - Topics include: history of settlement, livestock introduction/ownership, migrants and cattle, problems caused by tsetse, problem areas, strategies to deal with tsetse and diseases, use of medicines, traditional approaches, extent of damage, and effectiveness of modern medicines.
  - Provisional research questions guided interviews; respondents selected for knowledge and accessibility; attempted to capture a representative picture across three social clusters.

- participants and sampling
  - Informants drawn from three clusters: (i) long-established Korekore villages, (ii) border villages with abundant tsetse near protected areas, (iii) transitional villages between established and frontier areas.

- Data processing and storage
  - Interviews recorded; transcripts created and later stored at the University of Zimbabwe.
  - ForEnvironmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) requirements, transcripts anonymised and converted from Word to Rich Text Format (RTF).
  - Personal names replaced with non-real, pseudonymous identifiers; exact dates generalized to less precise dates to protect identities.
  - Each interview coded with a letter and number to preserve anonymity.

- Data structure and format
  - The dataset is an RTF document containing the interview transcripts.
  - Metadata and coding support future discovery and reuse; prepared to integrate with data portals and catalogues.

- Privacy, ethics, and governance
  - Verbal consent obtained from participants prior to interviews.
  - Anonymisation and date masking implemented to reduce re-identification risk.
  - Data prepared to meet Environmental Information Data Centre requirements, balancing openness with privacy.

- Provenance and acknowledgements
  - Acknowledges assistance from Albert Chisauka, Tendai Hove, and Ian Scoones.
  - Data provenance linked to the DD DAC project activities and interdisciplinary collaboration.

- Reuse considerations for Data Stewards
  - Ensure metadata adequately describes the interview topics, sampling, and anonymisation procedures.
  - Maintain format compatibility (RTF) for long-term access and EIDC compliance.
  - Preserve data integrity through secure storage at the originating institution and clear licensing/usage terms through the data centre.
