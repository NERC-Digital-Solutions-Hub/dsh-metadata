# Supporting documentation

- Context and purpose
  - Part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC) research project.
  - Data contributed to DDDAC research; funded by NERC (NE/J000701/1) with support from ESPA.
  - Zimbabwean interdisciplinary team (sociologists, GIS experts, entomologists) focused on local impacts and responses to tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis in Mukwichi communal lands, Chundu Ward, Hurungwe.

- Data collected
  - Qualitative data from key informant interviews with local community members.
  - Timeframe: December 2012 to August 2013.
  - Interview topics covered: history of settlement, livestock introduction and ownership, migrants and cattle, problems caused by tsetse (agriculture, labor, health), tsetse patches, coping strategies, sleeping sickness, Nagana, use and effectiveness of modern medicines, traditional approaches, extent of damage and risks.

- Sampling and methodology
  - Provisional research questions developed by University of Zimbabwe researchers with local support.
  - Respondents selected for knowledge of disease and accessibility.
  - Coverage aimed to reflect three community clusters: established Korekore villages, border-area villages with migrants, and transitional villages near protected areas.

- Consent, privacy, and ethics
  - Verbal consent obtained from all participants prior to interviews.
  - Interviews recorded; transcripts created from audio recordings.
  - Attempts to ensure anonymity: interview transcripts anonymised; non-real names used; imprecise dates used when precise dates could reveal identities.
  - Interviews coded with letters/numbers to protect identities.

- Data handling and format
  - Transcripts stored securely at the University of Zimbabwe.
  - To meet Environmental Information Data Centre requirements, transcripts were anonymised and converted from Word to Rich Text Format (RTF).
  - The file structure comprises richly formatted transcripts in an RTF document.

- Data governance, sharing, and standards
  - Emphasis on data quality, provenance, and governance; metadata considerations addressed through anonymisation and coding.
  - Data sharing considerations reflect balancing openness with confidentiality constraints; underlying data sharing aligned with institutional and data-centre requirements.
  - Highlights the need for clear documentation of data origins, processing steps, and accessibility for monitoring and policy evaluation.

- Acknowledgements and funding
  - Acknowledgement of contributions from Albert Chisauka, Tendai Hove, and Ian Scoones.
  - Funded under NERC project NE/J000701/1 with ESPA support.

- Relevance to monitoring frameworks
  - Provides qualitative, community-level perspectives on environmental health risks (tsetse, disease, livestock, agriculture, health systems).
  - Demonstrates practical data management practices: consent, anonymisation, secure storage, standardized data formats (RTF), and alignment with data-centre requirements.
  - Illustrates how to structure and document qualitative data for use in monitoring frameworks, supporting transparency, metadata needs, and governance considerations.
