# Supporting documentation

## Overview
- Part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC) with funding from NERC project NE/J000701/1 and support from ESPA.
- Zimbabwean interdisciplinary team (sociologists, GIS experts, entomologists) collected both quantitative and qualitative data to understand how local communities are affected by tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis in Mukwichi, Chundu Ward, Hurungwe.
- Aimed to contribute to environmental health research and monitoring within a broader project.

## Data and scope
- Data consist of rich qualitative transcripts from key informant interviews with local residents.
- Focus on experiences and responses to tsetse, sleeping sickness, Nagana, and related household, agricultural, and health impacts.
- Timeframe: Interviews conducted between December 2012 and August 2013.
- Informants selected to capture a broad picture across three societal clusters:
  - Long-established Korekore villages
  - Borderland villages with high tsetse activity and migrant land seekers
  - Transitional villages near frontier/protected areas

## Methods and data collection
- Semi-structured interviews guided by a checklist to cover topics such as:
  - History of settlement and livestock dynamics
  - Migrants, cattle movements
  - Problems caused by tsetse (agriculture, labor, health)
  - Local issue hotspots (tsetse patches)
  - Coping strategies for tsetse, sleeping sickness, and Nagana
  - Effectiveness of modern medicine and traditional approaches
  - Perceived damage and risks from tsetse
- Provisional research questions developed by University of Zimbabwe researchers; local research assistant supported data collection.
- Respondents chosen for knowledge of disease and accessibility; efforts to ensure broad representation.

## Data handling and formats
- Interviews recorded and later transcribed; transcripts stored at the University of Zimbabwe.
- To meet Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) requirements:
  - Transcripts anonymised and converted from Word to Rich Text Format (RTF).
  - Real names replaced with non-identifying placeholders; exact dates altered to less precise dates when necessary.
  - Each interview coded with a letter-number system to protect identities.
- Data are organized as an RTF document containing the transcripts.

## Ethical considerations
- Verbal consent obtained from all participants prior to interviews.
- Anonymisation and pseudonymisation implemented to protect participants’ identities.
- Dates and identifying details adjusted to prevent disclosure.

## Data management, access, and use
- Data stored securely at the University of Zimbabwe.
- Format (RTF) chosen to facilitate sharing with data centres while maintaining anonymisation.
- Aligned with Environmental Information Data Centre requirements for data curation and accessibility.
- Output supports understanding environmental health impacts and informs broader monitoring and policy-related analysis within the DDDAC framework.
