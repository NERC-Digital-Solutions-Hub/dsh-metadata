# Supporting documentation

- The research is part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC) and contributed data to its broader studies.
- Funded by NERC project NE/J000701/1 with support from ESPA; conducted in Zimbabwe by an interdisciplinary team (sociologists, GIS experts, entomologists).
- Data focus: transcripts from key informant interviews with local people in Mukwichi communal lands, Hurungwe (Chundu Ward), on experiences with tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis.
- Interviews collected December 2012–August 2013; verbal consent obtained; semi-structured format with a topic checklist to cover core research issues.

## Data collection and topics

- Provisional research questions developed by University of Zimbabwe researchers; assisted by a local research assistant.
- Topics covered included:
  - History of settlement
  - Livestock introduction and ownership
  - Migrants and cattle
  - Problems caused by tsetse to households (agriculture, labour, health)
  - Problem areas and tsetse patches
  - Strategies for dealing with tsetse, sleeping sickness, and Nagana
  - Usefulness and effectiveness of modern medicines
  - Traditional approaches to tsetse and related diseases
  - Extent of damage and risks from tsetse

## Sampling and informants

- Respondents were selected for their knowledge of the disease and accessibility.
- Aimed to capture a broad picture across three community clusters:
  - Long-established Korekore villages
  - Border villages where tsetse is abundant due to migrant settlement
  - Transitional villages between established and frontier areas

## Data handling, anonymisation, and privacy

- Interviews were recorded; transcripts created from audio recordings.
- Transcripts were stored securely at the University of Zimbabwe.
- To meet Environmental Information Data Centre requirements:
  - Word transcripts anonymised and converted to Rich Text Format (RTF).
  - Individual names replaced with non-real names; exact dates generalized to less precise dates where needed.
  - Each interview coded with a letter and number to protect interviewee identities.

## Data structure and storage

- Data deposit consists of the RTF document containing the transcripts.
- Stored securely and prepared for repository requirements.
