# Supporting documentation

- Purpose and context
  - Part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC) research project.
  - Data contributed to consortium research; funded by NERC project NE/J000701/1 with ESPA support.
  - Zimbabwean interdisciplinary team (sociologists, GIS experts, entomologists) collected both quantitative and qualitative data.
  - Dataset focuses on how local people in Mukwichi communal lands (Chundu Ward) are affected by and respond to tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis.

- Data collection and methods
  - Key informants selected from three village clusters: established Korekore villages; border-area villages with abundant tsetse; transitional villages between established and frontier areas.
  - Interviews conducted Dec 2012 – Aug 2013; verbal consent obtained; semi-structured format with a topics checklist.
  - Topics covered include settlement history, livestock, migrants, tsetse-related problems, affected activities (agriculture, labor, health), tsetse patches, coping strategies, modern medicines, traditional remedies, and perceived damage/risk.
  - Provisional research questions guided by University of Zimbabwe researchers; local research assistant supported data collection.
  - Interviews recorded and transcribed; transcripts created later and anonymised for storage.

- Data structure and storage
  - The data set consists of transcripts stored as Rich Text Format (RTF) documents.
  - Transcripts entered into Microsoft Word during collection and later anonymised; converted to RTF to meet Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) requirements.
  - Individual names replaced with non-real aliases; exact dates generalized to protect identities.
  - Each interview coded with a letter and number to preserve respondent anonymity.
  - Transcripts stored securely at the University of Zimbabwe.

- Ethics, consent, and anonymisation
  - Verbal consent obtained from all participants prior to interviews.
  - Anonymisation includes using pseudonyms, date generalisation, and coded interview identifiers.
  - Data handling aligned with EIDC requirements to enable responsible sharing and reuse while safeguarding participant privacy.

- Provenance and funding
  - Research conducted under the DDDAC project framework.
  - Funded by NERC (NE/J000701/1) with ESPA support.
  - Multidisciplinary team and collaboration across local and academic partners.

- Access, discoverability, and reuse
  - Data prepared to meet Environmental Information Data Centre standards, enhancing discoverability and potential reuse.
  - Final dataset is an anonymised, text-based transcript collection (RTF) suitable for qualitative analysis and cross-study comparisons.
  - User guidance and provenance information accompany the dataset to support appropriate reuse within the data stewardship framework.
