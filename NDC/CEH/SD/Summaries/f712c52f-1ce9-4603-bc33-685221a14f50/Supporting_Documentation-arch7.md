# Supporting documentation

- Part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC) research
- Funded by NERC project NE/J000701/1 with support from ESPA
- In Zimbabwe, an interdisciplinary team (sociologists, GIS experts, entomologists) collected both quantitative and qualitative data
- Data contribute to the consortium’s research on tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis

## Data content

- Rich text format (rtf) document containing transcripts of key informant interviews
- Focus: how local people in Mukwichi communal lands, Hurungwe (Chundu Ward), are affected by and respond to tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis
- Interviews conducted Dec 2012 – Aug 2013
- Verbal consent obtained; interviews were semi-structured with flexible topics
- Interviews recorded; transcripts produced and stored

## Data collection and sampling

- Provisional questions developed by experienced researchers from the University of Zimbabwe; assisted by a locally based research assistant
- Respondents selected for knowledge of the disease and accessibility
- Aimed to capture a broad view across three community clusters:
  - Long-established Korekore villages
  - Border villages near protected areas with abundant tsetse flies (in-migrant land seekers)
  - Transitional villages between established and frontier areas

## Data processing and anonymisation

- Transcripts stored as Microsoft Word documents, later anonymised and converted to Rich Text Format (rtf) to meet Environmental Information Data Centre requirements
- Individual names changed to non-real names; exact dates replaced with less precise dates to protect identity
- Each interview coded with a letter and number to protect informants’ identities

## Data structure and storage

- Data set comprises the rtf document containing the interview transcripts
- Transcripts stored securely at the University of Zimbabwe

## Provenance and acknowledgements

- Acknowledgements: Albert Chisauka, Tendai Hove, Ian Scoones

## GIS implications and potential data products

- Although primarily qualitative, the data relate to specific geographic areas (Mukwichi, Chundu Ward) and can be combined with spatial data on tsetse distribution, settlement patterns, and environmental conditions
- Enables map-based visualisations of community experiences and coping strategies related to tsetse and sleeping sickness
- Potential to accompany GIS layers with narrative insights and respondent perspectives for policy and public outreach products
