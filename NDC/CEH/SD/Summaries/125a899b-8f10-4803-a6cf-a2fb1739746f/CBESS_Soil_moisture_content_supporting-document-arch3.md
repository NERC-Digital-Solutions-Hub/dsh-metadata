# Coastal and Biodiversity Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil moisture content from three soil depths on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset measuring soil moisture content (%) at three soil depths (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm) on salt marsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay as part of the CBESS program.
- Field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples include an additional sampling window (2–6 March 2013).
- Lead staff: Hilary Ford.

## Locations and sites
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Coordinates provided for each site.
- Site selection represents two contrasting soil types: clay soils in Essex and sandy soils in Morecambe Bay.
- Broader regional differences: inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation differ between regions.
- Grazing context:
  - Essex: hare grazing with heavy winter grazing by Brent geese.
  - Morecambe Bay: intensive sheep grazing with pink-footed geese in winter; West Plain lightly grazed.

## Monitoring period and sampling details
- Sampling during Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples also collected 2–6 March 2013.
- Sampling method: field moisture measured from bulk density samples taken in 1 m x 1 m quadrats.

## Variables observed
- Primary variable: Soil moisture content (%) at three depths:
  - SMC_1: 0–10 cm
  - SMC_2: 10–20 cm
  - SMC_3: 20–30 cm
- Dataset metadata fields include:
  - Row Number (sorting order)
  - Season (Winter W, Summer S)
  - Location (Morecambe M, Essex E)
  - Site (CS, WS for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex)
  - Habitat (Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22)
  - Scale (A=1 m, B=1–10 m, C=10–100 m, D=100–upper limit)

## Methods and data handling
- Field measurements used bulk density rings (3.1 cm height, 7 cm diameter) to sample at 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm depths.
- Fresh mass weighed, then dried for 72 hours at 105°C to determine water content.
- Data stored in an Excel workbook; some fields indicate not applicable (NA) or not available.

## Data structure and completeness
- Data described by a structured dataset with explicit site, habitat, depth, and seasonal descriptors.
- NA values indicate data not available due to loss of sample or missing data.
- Some descriptive fields (calibration procedures, data checks) are listed as None, indicating limited methodological detail in those sections.
- Data provenance attributed to Hilary Ford and organized with specific site coordinates and sampling context.
