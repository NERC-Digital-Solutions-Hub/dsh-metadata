# Coastal and Biodiversity Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil moisture content from three soil depths on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Field measurements of soil moisture (%), at three depth zones (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm) across six saltmarsh sites.
- Timeframe: Winter and Summer 2013 (Essex winter samples collected 2–6 March 2013).
- Responsible staff: Hilary Ford.

## Data content and structure
- Primary variables: Soil moisture content at three depths (SMC_1, SMC_2, SMC_3) expressed as a percentage.
- Metadata fields include: Row Number, Season (Winter W / Summer S), Location (Morecambe M / Essex E), Site (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex), Habitat (Mudflat MF / Saltmarsh SM), Quadrat Number (1–22), Scale (A = 1 m; B = 1–10 m; C = 10–100 m; D = 100–upper limit).
- Data structure notes: NA values indicate data not available due to loss of samples during processing.

## Sites and locations
- Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM). Coordinates provided.
- Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP). Coordinates provided.
- Site descriptions reflect two contrasting soil types (clay in Essex; sandy in Morecambe Bay) and differing grazing regimes and inundation patterns.

## Methods and sampling details
- Sampling campaign: Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples collected in early March 2013.
- Field method: Soil moisture measured from bulk density samples collected in 1 m × 1 m quadrats.
- Depths sampled: 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm using a 3.1 cm height, 7 cm diameter bulk density ring.
- Processing: Samples weighed fresh and then dried (72 hours at 105°C) to determine water content.

## File formats and documentation
- Primary file format: Excel workbook.
- Dataset field descriptions include: Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Quadrat Number, Scale, and SMC_1–SMC_3.
- NA values denote missing data due to sample loss.

## Data governance and sharing considerations
- Metadata-rich dataset with explicit site, habitat, depth, and measurement details, facilitating cataloguing and discovery.
- Potential governance considerations for Data Stewards:
  - Addressing incomplete user needs and timely data delivery.
  - Encouraging standardization of metadata across sites and CBESS datasets for interoperability.
  - Documentation of data creation and processing steps to support reuse and updates.
  - Clear handling of missing data (NA) and its implications for downstream analyses.
- Data readiness for portal/catalogue integration, given explicit structure, depth-specific variables, and site descriptions.
