# Coastal and Biodiversity Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil moisture content from three soil depths on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset of soil moisture content (%) measured at three depth intervals (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm) on salt marsh sites in Morecambe Bay and Essex.
- Field measurements taken in Winter and Summer 2013; additional Essex winter samples collected 2–6 March 2013.
- Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
- Data format: Excel workbook.

## Locations and sites
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM); coordinates provided for AH, FW, and TM.
  - AH: 51°47'N, 0°52'E
  - FW: 51°49'N, 0°58'E
  - TM: 51°41'N, 0°56'E
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
  - CS: 54°10'N, 3°00'W
  - WS: 54°08'N, 2°48'W
  - WP: coordinates not specified in the provided details.
- Habitat contrast and management context:
  - Essex: clay soils, hare and Brent goose grazing (over-wintering) intensities.
  - Morecambe Bay: sandy soils, heavier sheep grazing with pink-footed geese in winter; West Plain lightly grazed.

## Monitoring and sampling design
- Field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples collected during 2–6 March 2013.
- Sampling units: 1 m × 1 m quadrats.
- Depths sampled: 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm.
- Bulk density samples collected with 3.1 cm height, 7 cm diameter rings; samples weighed fresh, then dried at 105°C for 72 hours to determine water content.

## Variables and data structure
- Primary variable: Soil moisture content (%) at three depths.
  - SMC_1: 0–10 cm
  - SMC_2: 10–20 cm
  - SMC_3: 20–30 cm
- Supporting fields:
  - Row Number (sorting)
  - Season (Winter = W, Summer = S)
  - Location (Morecambe = M, Essex = E)
  - Site (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex)
  - Habitat (Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22)
  - Scale (A = 1 m, B = 1–10 m, C = 10–100 m, D = 100–upper limit)
- Data notes: NA indicates data not available due to sample loss.

## Data format and quality notes
- File format: Excel workbook.
- Calibration procedures: None listed.
- Statistical treatment: None listed.
- Data checking procedures (quality control): None listed.
- Data completeness notes: NA cells indicate missing data due to sample loss.

## Contextual notes
- Sites were selected to represent contrasting soil types (clay in Essex vs. sandy soils in Morecambe Bay) and differing inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.
- Grazing regimes varied by site, potentially influencing soil moisture patterns (Essex: hare and Brent geese grazing; Morecambe Bay: heavy sheep grazing with geese in winter; West Plain lightly grazed).
