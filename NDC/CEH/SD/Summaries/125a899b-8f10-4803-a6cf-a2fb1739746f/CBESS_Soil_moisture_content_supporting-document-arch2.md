# Coastal and Biodiversity Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil moisture content from three soil depths on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Field-measured soil moisture content across three shallow depth intervals on salt marsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay.
- Part of a standardized monitoring effort to support environmental health assessment and policy performance over time.
- Data collected during Winter and Summer 2013, emphasizing comparability across sites and habitat types.

## Dataset details and scope
- Content: Soil moisture content (%) derived from bulk density samples taken in 1 m x 1 m quadrats.
- Depths sampled: 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm.
- Sites and locations:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Coordinates (representative): AH 51°47′N, 0°52′W; FW 51°49′N, 0°58′W; TM 51°41′N, 0°56′W; CS 54°10′N, 3°0′W; WS 54°8′N, 2°48′W.
- Timeframe: Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter sampling conducted 2–6 March 2013.
- Habitat context: Saltmarsh sites representing two contrasting soil types (clay soils in Essex; sandy soils in Morecambe Bay) with differing inundation frequency, creek structure, and vegetation.
- Grazing context: Essex sites heavily grazed by hare and Brent geese; Morecambe Bay sites heavily grazed by sheep with pink-footed geese in winter; one site (West Plain) lightly grazed.

## Data collection and methodology
- Sampling design: Field campaign conducted during Winter and Summer 2013; quadrats used to obtain bulk density samples.
- Measurement protocol: Bulk density ring (3.1 cm height, 7 cm diameter) used to collect samples from each quadrat; fresh mass measured, then dried at 105°C for 72 hours to determine water content (soil moisture).
- Data products: Excel workbook containing measurements; NA indicates missing data due to sample loss.
- Quality control and calibration: No explicit calibration procedures or data quality control steps described in the dataset notes.

## Dataset structure and variables
- Core variables:
  - SMC_1: Soil moisture content (%) at 0–10 cm
  - SMC_2: Soil moisture content (%) at 10–20 cm
  - SMC_3: Soil moisture content (%) at 20–30 cm
- Descriptive fields for data organization:
  - Row Number: Sorting index for input order
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S)
  - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E)
  - Site: CS (Cartmel Sands), WS (Warton Sands), WP (West Plain) in Morecambe; AH (Abbotts Hall), FW (Fingringhoe Wick), TM (Tillingham Marshes) in Essex
  - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM)
  - Quadrat Number: 1–22
  - Scale: A (1 m), B (1–10 m), C (10–100 m), D (100 m and beyond)
- Data notes: Missing values are indicated as NA.

## Data provenance and responsibilities
- Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
- Data origin: Direct field measurements from specified saltmarsh sites, with context on grazing and inundation regimes to support interpretation of moisture variations.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy
- Enables standardized, cross-site comparison of soil moisture as an indicator of hydrological and ecological condition on salt marshes.
- Supports monitoring of ecosystem service sustainability by linking moisture status to vegetation, grazing regimes, and inundation patterns.
- Dataset structure facilitates integration into broader environmental health dashboards and portals for ongoing policy performance assessment.

## Access and data use
- Output format: Excel workbook; data are presented in a structured, tabular form suitable for aggregation and longitudinal analyses.
- Data completeness: Some data entries are missing (NA), requiring handling in analyses where necessary.
