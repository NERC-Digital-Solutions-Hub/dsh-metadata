- Site information
  - Location and purpose
    - Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales; upland moorland habitat
    - Automated climate manipulation using drought and warming treatments since 1998
    - Power: solar and wind; designed for remote UK sites
  - Ecosystem context
    - Dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather) >60% biomass; other species present (Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum, mosses and liverworts)
  - Soil and vegetation
    - Humo-ferric podzols with variable eluvial (E) and illuvial (Bh) horizons
    - Tabled soil characteristics across horizons (N, C, C:N, base cations, etc.)
  - Climate and site characteristics (1997–2014 data)
    - Mean air temperature: 8.0 C
    - Mean soil temperature in control plots: 7.5 C
    - Mean annual rainfall: 1411 mm
    - Total nitrogen deposition: 20–25 kg N ha-1 yr-1
  - Additional site data
    - Vegetation composition, litterfall (177 g m-2), and baseline chemistry
    - Plant and bryophyte species presence; bryophytes indicated with asterisk

- Climate change treatment information
  - Treatments and replication
    - Two treatments: drought and warming; each with three replicate plots
    - Three control plots to mirror shading; total 9 plots
  - Drought treatment
    - Mechanism: retractable polyethylene roof; active May–September (1999–2011), later adjusted to April–October (since 2012)
    - Effect: ~20% reduction in annual rainfall; up to ~80% exclusion of rainfall during drought periods
    - Operational constraints: some small rain events missed; wind (>10 m/s) stops operation
    - Plant-water interactions: some roof-related surface water accumulation observed (not permanently damaging)
  - Warming treatment
    - Mechanism: retractable aluminium mesh curtains over plots; reflects infrared radiation
    - Rainfall interactions: rain detected by a sensor triggers retraction to minimize rainfall loss; typical annual rainfall reduction ~14%
    - Operational details: night-time warming; sometimes rain exclusion due to sensor timing
  - Operational challenges and updates
    - Frame wear and failure led to 2017 replacement of frames (new frames installed atop old ones)
    - 2016–2017 refurbishment caused longer maintenance times
    - 2016–2021: some years with no drought operation due to refurbishments, high winds, water on roofs, or COVID-19
  - Data and interpretation notes
    - Table 6 provides year-by-year drought and warming operation details (dates, reductions)
    - Growing Degree Days (GDD) calculated to compare warming impact; values provided for control and warming years

- Equipment, protocols and data processing methodology
  - Data collection infrastructure
    - Automated Weather Station (AWS) for meteorological data
    - Plot-level sensors for micro-meteorological data (soil/air temperature, soil moisture)
    - Rainfall measurement: storage rain gauge (site-level) and plot-level throughfall collectors
    - Additional data: soil respiration, trace gas fluxes, net ecosystem CO2 exchange, vegetation surveys, canopy reflectance, phenology, and chemistry
  - Data types and frequency
    - AWS meteorological data: daily measurements (air temp, humidity, rainfall, pressure, radiation, wind)
    - Micro-meteorological data: daily plot-level measurements (soil/air temp, soil moisture)
    - Rainfall: site-level storage gauge (biweekly) and plot-level throughfall (biweekly)
    - Other measurements: periodic (monthly, seasonal, annual) depending on variable
  - Data handling and quality control
    - Early micro-meteorological data logged in hourly; since 2016, half-hour averages
    - Basic visual QC in Excel; no automated meta-constraints due to contextual reasons (e.g., unusual cold weeks)
    - Data not fully stored in the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC); contact project staff for additional details
  - Data processing notes
    - Throughfall calculations to derive treatment-specific rainfall changes; data gaps treated by excluding affected plots or infilling with average reductions when appropriate
    - Rainfall data preferred from the robust ground-level gauge when available (less prone to logger/power issues)

- Appendix and figures
  - Site layout and quadrat mapping included (figures referenced in Appendix)
  - Details of plot and quadrat arrangement for measurement areas

- Practical implications for data users
  - Licensing and citation requirements clearly specified
  - Comprehensive metadata on sensors, sampling frequency, and data processing steps provided
  - Acknowledgement of gaps due to frame refurbishment, weather extremes, and COVID-19 constraints
