# Generating a Soil Moisture Characteristic Using the WP4C

## Overview
- A soil moisture characteristic (moisture release curve) relates water potential (MPa) to water content (g/g) for a soil.
- This curve describes water storage, plant-available water, and helps predict water and contaminant transport in soil.
- The procedure focuses on generating a wetting characteristic (noting hysteresis with wetting vs drying).

## What you generate
- A moisture characteristic by measuring water potential and water content across a range of water contents.
- Data used to plot the moisture release curve (w vs. water potential) for a soil sample.

## Key concepts
- Moisture characteristic is hysteretic: at a given water potential, wetting-path samples have higher or lower water content than drying-path samples.
- Wetting characteristic is the emphasis of the procedure described.

## Procedure (1–9)
- 1) Measure the mass of a clean stainless steel WP4C sample cup (Mc).
- 2) Mix soil and water to reach the desired water content.
- 3) Seal the sample with a disposable lid.
- 4) Repeat for various water contents; for large batches, mixed soil can serve multiple samples at the same water content.
- 5) Measure the water potential of each sample, then quickly weigh the wet soil plus cup (Mw) to minimize moisture loss.
- 6) Place each sample (lid removed) in a drying oven at 105°C for at least 16 hours.
- 7) After drying, place samples in a desiccator to prevent moisture uptake; allow to cool (10–15 minutes).
- 8) When cool, measure the dry soil plus cup mass (Md) and calculate water content: (Mw − Md) / (Md − Mc).
- 9) Plot the resulting data in a spreadsheet to form the moisture release curve (Figure 1 as an example).

## Calculation and data handling
- Water content (g/g) is calculated using: (Mw − Md) / (Md − Mc).
- Data are compiled and plotted to illustrate the relationship between water potential and water content (e.g., sample curves in figures).

## Output and data products
- A plotted moisture release curve (wetting characteristic) for the soil tested.
- A data table of water content and corresponding water potential for analysis and sharing.
- Potential to use the curve to describe soil water storage and plant-available water in broader analyses.

## Practical notes and best practices
- Sealing the sample cup with Parafilm or impermeable tape can improve equilibration.
- Bulk mixing (15 g or more) before aliquoting improves reliability and consistency.
- If the water-content range is unknown, start with an air-dry sample and incrementally increase water content by about 0.05 g/g or less until saturation.
- The note about “this line is a power law fit to the data” refers to data representation in the example figure.

## Example and context
- The document provides an example moisture release curve for Walla Walla silt loam (Figure 1) with corresponding data points and a power-law fit line.
