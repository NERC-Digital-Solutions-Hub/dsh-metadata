# Comprehensive Field Protocols for Monitoring Vegetation Productivity Across Grasslands, Bogs, Montane Habitats, and Woodlands

## Overview
- Detailed, multi-habitat monitoring protocol to assess vegetation productivity (aNPP), biomass, litter production, nutrient status (P and N), and photosynthetic capacity (LICOR).
- Emphasizes standardized plot design, randomization, minimal trampling, GPS/sketch-map-based re-finding, and seasonal sampling.
- Integrates exclosures to quantify grazed vs. ungrazed dynamics; includes soil, tissue, and tree-level measurements (DBH, height) for holistic productivity estimates.
- References to established methodologies (e.g., CS procedures, Sphagnum methods) and aims to align with cross-site comparisons (e.g., Bunce Woodland Survey, CS plots).

## Plot identification and layout
- Deploy four plots per site, randomly chosen after mapping the habitat area.
- Plot location constraints vary by habitat (within field margins for grazed plots; >5 m from boundary for unenclosed sites; north-south orientation for sampling consistency).
- Use a nested plot approach where applicable (see woodland section) to enable joint analyses with existing survey frameworks.
- Each plot is marked with GPS coordinates and sketch maps, with careful attention to minimizing trampling during setup and visits.

## Plot design specifics by habitat

### Grazed and semi-improved grasslands
- Within each plot, two 1x1 m sub-plots are randomly placed (1 m apart) inside a 14.14 m x 14.14 m plot in woodland sections (see nested plot design).
- Biomass is cut to 1 cm height within each sub-plot for sampling bryophytes and herbaceous vegetation.
- Exclosures are installed after cutting to allow gated comparisons of grazed vs. ungrazed patches; exclosures removed only when harvesting is complete.
- Reposition and re-mark plots each season to maintain continuity and data integrity.

### Ungrazed calcareous and acid grasslands
- Similar protocol to enclosed grasslands but plot location relies on a grid-based approach since boundaries are less distinct.

### Winter identification and plotting
- Identify habitat and randomly select four plots (>5 m from boundary; >=3 m apart).
- Establish habitat area axes, generate four random coordinates, and record plot numbers and coordinates.
- Document GPS data and photograph plots before and after cutting.

### Summer and autumn visits (grasslands)
- Harvest at peak biomass; collect soil and plant tissue samples (P and N) and measure maximum photosynthetic rate (LICOR) of dominant species.
- Re-find plots using sketch map and GPS; cut biomass to 1 cm, weigh fresh mass, grab-sample for lab analysis, photograph, and re-install exclosures if applicable.
- Autumn cuts target regrowth to maximize late-season biomass, with cut biomass weighed and samples collected as in summer.

### Unenclosed calcareous and acid grasslands
- Follow the same steps as enclosed grasslands, with plot location based on a grid overlaid on the area.

## Montane and special habitats
- Montane plots: six small inverted hanging baskets with cages (exclosures) in Empetrum nigrum and Salix herbacea habitats; periodic cutting and species identification planned. January visits to decide on vegetation cutting; potential measurement of internode extension.
- Habitat-specific notes: deer grazing may be negligible in some woodlands; exclosures may be unnecessary unless sheep grazing is present in upland woodlands.

### Tree and woodland habitats (Conwy valley and similar)
- Use a nested plot design within a 14.14 m x 14.14 m woodland plot.
- Within each woodland plot, place two 1x1 m sub-plots at random positions for understorey sampling; ensure sub-plots are at least 3 m apart.
- Record plant species composition across the whole plot and sub-plots; count saplings <1.3 m for DBH applicability.
- Mark sub-plots with colored canes; photograph plots; capture GPS coordinates and include sketch maps with reference features to aid re-finding in summer.
- Spring vernal flora sampling: cut vernal biomass if present, weigh, collect grab samples, and return to the lab.

## Measurements and sampling activities

### Biomass and sampling
- Cut herbaceous biomass in sub-plots to 1 cm; weigh fresh mass; collect grab samples for lab analysis; photograph sub-plots before and after cutting.
- Weigh cut biomass and remove outside the plot; re-install exclosures after cutting in grazed plots.
- For litter and understorey productivity, repeat cutting events across summer and autumn as per habitat protocols.

### Soil, tissue, and photosynthesis
- Collect soil samples and plant tissue samples for phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) during summer peak biomass.
- Measure maximum photosynthetic rate of dominant species using LICOR during peak biomass visits.

### GPS, mapping, and plot refinding
- Record GPS coordinates for each plot and sub-plot; maintain sketch maps with compass bearings, pacing distances, and reference features.
- Use marker canes, exclosures, and reference features to refind plots during subsequent visits with minimal disturbance.

### Tree-focused measurements (woodlands)
- Diameter at breast height (DBH) and species recorded for all trees and shrubs >1.3 m; height measured with relascope for tree identification and growth assessment.
- Tree coring for annual wood increment: core at 1.3 m height, prepare cores for ring width analysis, and estimate wood density for mass increment calculations.
- Growth increments computed with formulas integrating form factor, DBH, height, and ring width.

## Special productivity and moss protocols

### Sphagnum productivity (bogs/heaths)
- Use cranked wires to measure shoot extension and capitulum density; perform quarterly measurements over two years.
- Sample 30 stems at the final visit for dry weight and separate into stem and capitulum; analyze annual production per m^2.

### Pleurocarpous moss productivity
- Use plastic mesh over mats to estimate annual moss growth; after one year, harvest, clean, dry at 80 °C for 24 hours, and weigh.
- Calculate moss productivity per m^2 using upper and lower bound estimates based on moss cover under the mesh.

### Dwarf shrubs (Calluna) on bogs/heaths
- Patch selection across a burn-age chronosequence (pioneer to mature).
- Within each patch, establish 1 m^2 plots with two sub-plots for biomass sampling; cut regrowth to 1 cm and measure N and P in tissue; weigh and photograph.

### Litter and bryophyte sampling
- Install litter buckets within 14.14 m plots; sample monthly from September onward to December; dry at 80 °C and weigh.
- Litter sampling supplements understorey productivity estimates.

### Leaf production (conifer plantations)
- For Sitka spruce plantations: estimate leaf canopy volume, select three branches to measure growth zone, harvest fresh leaves, oven-dry, and weigh to estimate annual leaf production per tree and per m^2 canopy.

## Data treatment and calculations

- aNPP (annual net primary production) calculations use grab sample dry weight and fresh mass harvest data to scale to per m^2 values.
  - aNPP = Dgs × (F1m / Fgs)
  - Dgs = dry mass of grab sample; F1m = fresh mass of 1 m^2 harvest; Fgs = fresh mass of grab sample.
- Woody mass increment calculations integrate form factor, DBH, height, and newest ring width, using specific equations outlined in the protocol.
- Sphagnum and moss productivity rely on density, capitulum counts, and dry mass per unit length or area, with correction factors for mesh-based estimates.
- Litter and leaf production measurements are used to partition production into litterfall and vegetation-derived inputs.

## Data management and governance considerations
- Emphasizes standardized metadata, clear documentation of sampling dates, GPS locations, plot coordinates, and sketch maps.
- Requires careful handling of exclosures, marker canes, and re-finding procedures to minimize data loss and trampling.
- Encourages integration with existing monitoring frameworks (e.g., CS, Bunce Woodland Survey) to enable cross-site comparisons.
