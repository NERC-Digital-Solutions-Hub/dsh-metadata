# Net Primary Production Protocols for Vegetation and Ecosystem Components

- Aim: Use standardized, repeatable data to demonstrate environmental condition and policy-relevant performance over time, enabling scrutiny of environmental health across multiple habitats.

- Context for Analysts Monitoring the Environment:
  - Works with predefined monitoring responsibilities across habitats.
  - Applies topic expertise and analytical methods, favoring broad, auditable approaches.
  - Emphasizes data verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and storage in appropriate portals.
  - Seeks to increase dataset value by combining with other relevant data and by enabling access to underlying data.

## General approach and workflow

- Plot selection and layout
  - Four plots per site, chosen randomly after site walk-through.
  - Plots positioned on a line inside the field, at least 3 m from the boundary and from each other (to minimize trampling).
  - Plot coordinates recorded on a sketch map; each plot numbered.
  - Orientation standardized (N–S) to sample vegetation moving away from boundaries.
- On-plot sampling protocol (for each plot)
  - Establish a 1 m × 1 m quadrat within the plot; photograph prior to any disturbance.
  - Record GPS reference; if needed, use standard handheld receivers (typical accuracy ~3 m).
  - Remove overhanging biomass outside the sub-plot; cut herbaceous biomass to 1 cm to include bryophytes; photograph after cutting.
  - Weigh fresh cut biomass; discard outside plot.
  - Install an exclosure if sampling grazed vegetation; document exclosure status.
  - Re-sample and photograph with minimal trampling; reset equipment after sampling each plot.
- Seasonal sampling cadence
  - Summer visits: harvest at peak biomass; soil sampling; plant tissue sampling for P and N; LICOR measurement of maximum photosynthetic rate for dominant species.
  - Autumn visits: harvest regrowth after peak biomass (especially where second cuts are not planned); time harvest to maximize regrowth or reflect farmer’s management; follow similar cutting and weighing procedures.
  - Winter visits (for unenclosed and certain habitats): random plot selection with habitat-specific constraints; standard 1 m² plots with similar cutting and weighing protocols; exclosures installed if grazed.
  - Spring visits (woodland and some habitats): vernal flora sampling; cut and weigh only if vernal biomass is present; collect grab samples for lab analysis.
- Refinding plots in subsequent visits
  - Use sketch maps, GPS, and marker canes/post markers to relocate plots with minimal trampling.

## Habitat-specific protocols

- Enclosed grasslands (grazed silage fields)
  - Four plots per field; exclosures used to separate grazed vs ungrazed areas.
  - Summer: harvest at peak biomass; additional soil and tissue sampling; LICOR measurement.
  - Autumn: possible second cut scheduling; same cutting/weighting protocol.

- Unenclosed calcareous and acid grasslands
  - Plot location based on a grid over the selected area (less clearly bounded); random coordinates across the grid.
  - Follow the same on-plot sampling and seasonal sampling as enclosed grasslands.

- Winter and summer cycles for unenclosed grasslands
  - Similar to enclosed grasslands but adapted to lack of physical boundaries; exclosures or markers used where grazing occurs.

- Graminoid vegetation on bogs and heath
  - Separate assessments for functional types (dwarf shrubs, Sphagnum, and graminoids).
  - Sampling layout: four plots per site, with GPS and sketch maps; exclosures used if grazed.
  - Summer: harvest at peak biomass; soil and tissue sampling; LICOR measurement.
  - Autumn: subplots cut to 1 cm; repeated biomass sampling.

- Montane
  - Six small inverted hanging baskets installed on ridge; two habitat types (Empetrum nigrum and Salix herbacea).
  - January decisions on cutting; potential measurement of internode extension; focus on new shoots.

- Habitats not requiring exclosures
  - Deer grazing considered negligible in certain woodlands; exclosures used only if grazing is present.

- Woodland habitats (nested plot design)
  - Plot: 14.14 m × 14.14 m with two 1 m × 1 m sub-plots.
  - Sub-plots placed at random within the parent plot; marked with colored canes; orientation north-south.
  - Spring: vernal flora survey; cut vernal biomass if present; grab samples collected.
  - Summer: peak biomass harvest; soil and plant tissue sampling; DBH and height measurements; leaf production sampling in Sitka spruce stands.
  - Plant species composition: census of entire nested plot; estimate cover and saplings; sub-plot species cover estimates; vegetation height measurements.
  - Cutting: sub-plots cut to 1 cm; biomass weighed; grab samples collected; photographs taken; exclosures installed if grazed.
  - Litter buckets: 20 random, evenly spaced buckets within the plot; monthly collection (Sept–Dec) to assess leaf litter production; samples dried and weighed.
  - Tree coring: cores collected from all trees/shrubs >1.3 m height; cores prepared for ring analysis; wood density measured; annual woody mass increment calculated with a specific formula.
  - DBH and height: diameters and heights recorded; multi-stemmed trees noted.
  - Litter and productivity: procedures for estimating leaf production and understorey productivity.
  - Spring vernal flora: targeted collection and weighing of green biomass if present.

- Dwarf shrubs (bog and heath)
  - Three patches with different age since last burn; three 1 m² plots per patch.
  - Within each plot: census plant composition; bryophyte sampling; vegetation height measurement.
  - Cutting: dominant dwarf shrubs cut to 1 cm; biomass weighed; tissue samples collected; photographs taken.

- Sphagnum productivity
  - Focus on hummock and lawn Sphagnum; five patches with 3 cranked wires per patch (15 wires total).
  - Microplots (10 cm × 10 cm) used to estimate capitulum density; wires installed; shoots measured quarterly over two years.
  - At final visit, 30 stems sampled for dry weight and weight separation.

- Pleurocarpous mosses
  - Moss mats with protective mesh used to measure annual moss production.
  - After one year, mats cut; dry weight measured; productivity estimated as an average of lower/upper bounds to account for mesh effects.

- Leaf production in Picea sitchensis plantation
  - Estimation of leaf canopy volume and annual leaf production per tree using branch-level sampling, crown volume estimates, and leaf dry mass measurements.

- Calculation of annual net primary production (aNPP)
  - aNPP = Dgs × (F1m / Fgs)
  - Dgs: dry grab sample mass; F1m: fresh mass harvested from 1 m²; Fgs: fresh mass of grab sample.
  - Demonstrates how to convert grab sample mass to per-square-meter production.

## Data collection, integration and outputs

- Data types collected
  - Biomass: fresh and dry masses; sub-sample weights.
  - Habitat and plot metadata: GPS coordinates, sketch maps, plot numbers, orientation.
  - Species composition: census data; percent cover; sub-plot species counts.
  - Physiological measurements: soil nutrients (P, N), leaf tissue analyses, LICOR photosynthetic rates.
  - Structural metrics: DBH, tree height, crown/leaf measurements, litter production.
  - Temporal data: seasonal sampling points (winter, spring, summer, autumn) and yearly increments (tree rings, moss growth).

- Data management and reporting
  - Use of standardized recording sheets; photographic records; marker canes/post markers for re-finding plots.
  - Exclosures and markers documented and re-installed as needed.
  - Planned integration with national or regional data portals; outputs designed for cross-site comparability with Bunce Woodland surveys and Countryside Survey (CS) plots.
