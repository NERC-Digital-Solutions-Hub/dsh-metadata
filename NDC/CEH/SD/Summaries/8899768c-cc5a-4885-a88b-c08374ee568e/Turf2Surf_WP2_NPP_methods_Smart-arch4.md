# Site identification and plot location

- The document outlines field protocols for measuring above-ground productivity (aNPP) across multiple habitats (grazed grasslands, unenclosed calcareous/acid grasslands, montane heath, broadleaved woodlands, bogs/heaths, Sphagnum, pleurocarp mosses, dwarf shrubs) within the Conwy region and related sites.
- Objectives include establishing random, well-spaced plots, enabling repeatable refinding, and collecting biomass and related measurements over time to support cross-habitat productivity analyses.

## Data collected and measurements

- Geographic and plot data
  - Randomly selected plots within defined boundaries; GPS coordinates recorded (typical 3 m accuracy for inexpensive devices).
  - Each plot assigned a unique number; sketch maps created with plotted axes, distances, and bearings.
- Plot and sub-plot layout
  - Within each main plot (often 14.14 m x 14.14 m), two 1 m x 1 m sub-plots are positioned at random locations; sub-plots ≥3 m apart.
  - Sub-plots oriented north–south; marked with colored canes; exclosures installed where applicable.
- Visual and photographic records
  - Baseline and post-cut photographs of plots and sub-plots; photograph numbers and dates recorded.
- Biomass and samples
  - Fresh mass of cut herbaceous vegetation (and grab samples for moisture/DM calculations).
  - Bryophyte and bryophyte-related samples; soil samples; plant tissue samples for phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N).
  - LICOR measurements of maximum photosynthetic rate for dominant species.
- Structural and taxonomic data
  - Plant species composition and percent cover within plots; vegetation height measurements.
  - DBH (diameter at breast height) and tree/shrub height (via relascope) for woody vegetation; occasional tree cores for annual mass increment.
- Exclosures and refinding
  - Exclosures installed post-cut where grazing effects are relevant; marker canes or posts used for refinding plots.
- Special habitat protocols
  - Sphagnum patches: capitulum density and stem weight per length; cranked wires installed for growth increments; repeated measurements over time.
  - Pleurocarpous mosses: annual moss production measured with secured mesh and subsequent dry mass.
  - Litter buckets (for leaf litter Dynamics): 20 random locations per plot with sampling every ~4 weeks from early September to December.
  - Dwarf shrub heath: patches of differing age since last burn sampled with 1 m² plots; canopy measurements and tissue sampling for nutrients.
  - Montane plots: 6 inverted baskets; willow/heath types sampled with standard protocol.
  - Woodland plots: nested 14.14 m x 14.14 m plots with two 1 m x 1 m sub-plots; DBH, species census, understory sampling, litter buckets, and tree coring.
- Data capture cadence
  - Winter: site identification and plot placement; initial GPS/photo records.
  - Spring: vernal flora checks in woodland plots; early biomass sampling.
  - Summer: peak biomass harvests; soil, tissue sampling, LICOR measurements.
  - Autumn: second rounds of cutting or regrowth harvests; exclosures removed when appropriate.
  - Specific habitats have additional mid-season checks (e.g., Sphagnum growth measurement every three months over two years; moss mats evaluated after year).

## Sampling design and execution

- Plot design
  - Random selection within field area; consistent orientation; nested sub-plots to enable joint analyses with existing CS/Bunce survey plots where relevant.
  - For unenclosed habitats, grid-based random point selection over mapped areas.
- Refinding plots
  - Sketch maps, GPS, and marker canes/post markers used to relocate plots with minimal disturbance.
- Cutting and sampling protocol
  - Biomass cut to 1 cm height within each sub-plot; fresh mass weighed; grab samples taken; exclosures installed if grazing is present; exclosures removed after stock removal following harvest windows.
  - Photographs captured before and after cutting; final exclosures reinstalled before livestock return.
- Species and structural data
  - Comprehensive plant species census within each nested plot; sub-plot species coverage estimates; sapling counts and DBH measurements for woody components; occasional tree coring for wood production estimates.
- Special measurements by habitat
  - Sphagnum: capitulo density, stem weight per length, and growth increments via cranked wires; five patches per site with three wires per patch.
  - Pleurocarp mosses: moss mats covered with mesh; annual growth calculated from cut weights and area.
  - Dwarf shrubs: age-structured patches sampled for total standing biomass and subsequent 1 m² harvesting for N and P tissue analysis.
  - Litter decomposition and leaf production: separate protocols for conifer plantations and broadleaved stands; leaf canopy volume estimations for Sitka spruce leaf production calculations.

## Data management, quality, and governance

- Metadata and traceability
  - Each plot and sub-plot is mapped, numbered, and GPS-tagged; photo numbers and dates logged; sketch maps maintained for refinding.
  - All weights, sample IDs, and measurements recorded on standardized recording sheets.
- Data standardization and comparability
  - Nested plot design (1 m² sub-plots within larger plots) enables cross-site comparisons and compatibility with Bunce/Woodland CS plots.
  - Standardized heights, cutting height (1 cm), and timing aligned with seasonal windows to ensure comparability.
- Limitations and considerations
  - GPS accuracy (3 m typical) introduces location uncertainty; careful refinding and sketch-map references mitigate this.
  - Management of trampling risk; minimal disturbance protocols.
  - Exclosure presence and grazing intensity can influence measurements; protocol includes context-specific decisions (e.g., deer grazing in Conwy woodlands may not require exclosures).

## Key calculations and outputs

- Annual Net Primary Productivity (aNPP) estimates
  - General aNPP formula: aNPP = Dgs × (F1m / Fgs), where Dgs is the dry mass obtained from grab samples, F1m is fresh mass per 1 m² harvest, and Fgs is the fresh mass of the grab sample.
- Woody productivity
  - Annual woody mass increment: Increment = π × F × D × H × W × wd, where F is the form factor, D is DBH minus bark width, H is height, W is the most recent tree ring width, and wd is wood density.
- Sphagnum productivity
  - Growth tracked via capitulum density and stem weight per unit length from cranked wire measurements; repeated sampling over two years with 30-stem harvests for component separation.
- Leaf production (conifer plantations)
  - Leaf production estimated from canopy volume and shoot/branch measurements; annual leaf dry mass per branch extrapolated to per-tree and then per-area production.
- Litter and bryophyte productivity
  - Litter bucket samples dried and weighed; pleurocarp moss growth calculated from post-mesh weights and area.
- Data outputs
  - Species composition, biomass weights, DBH, tree cores, litter volumes, soil and tissue data, photosynthesis rates, and growth increments, time-stamped and geo-referenced for long-term analysis.

## Key habitat-specific notes and references

- Habitat variety and sequencing
  - Grazed grasslands, enclosed grasslands, montane, woodlands, calcareous/acid grasslands, bogs, and heaths each have tailored plotting, cutting, and sampling steps to ensure consistency and comparability.
- References and methods
  - Methods reference established literature for Sphagnum growth, moss productivity, and forest productivity calculations (e.g., Clymo 1970; Husch et al. 2003; Coomes & Allen 2007; Weiner & Thomas 2001; Chave et al. 2009).
