# Site identification and plot location

- Purpose: Establish and locate experimental plots across diverse habitats to measure productivity components (aNPP) and related variables, using standardized, repeatable field protocols.
- General design: Mixed habitat protocols with a nested plot approach to enable cross-site comparability and integration with existing surveys (e.g., Bunce Woodland Survey, Countryside Survey).
- Plot layout overview:
  - Grazed silage fields and other grazed grasslands: four 1x1 m subplots placed on a line 3 m from the field boundary, with random coordinates along the inner boundary; plots oriented to sample vegetation from boundary inward.
  - Unenclosed calcareous and acid grasslands: plots located on a grid over the mapped area where boundaries are less distinct.
  - Woodland habitats: nested plots of 14.14 m x 14.14 m containing two 1x1 m subplots; orientation north-south; GPS reference marked with posts or canes; minimal trampling emphasized.
  - Montane and bog/heath graminoid contexts: small-scale setups (e.g., inverted hanging baskets for montane heath; cranked wires for Sphagnum patches).
- Plot identification steps:
  - After site walk, select four plots per habitat, applying distance constraints from boundaries and from each other (e.g., >3 m separation, >5 m from boundaries for unenclosed; 10 m from edges for woodland).
  - Establish area coordinates, draw axes, assign plot numbers, and record coordinates on a sketch map.
  - For each plot, orient N-S, lay out a 1x1 m quadrat, photograph, and record GPS position.
- Refinding and re-marking:
  - Use sketch maps, GPS, marker canes/post markers, and exclosures to relocate plots with minimal trampling during each visit.
  - Markers and exclosures are removed or reinstalled as needed per visit phase (summer, autumn, winter, etc.).
- Data capture at location:
  - Photograph plots before and after key interventions (e.g., cutting, exclosure installation).
  - Maintain detailed records of plot numbers, coordinates, photo numbers, and dates for traceability.
