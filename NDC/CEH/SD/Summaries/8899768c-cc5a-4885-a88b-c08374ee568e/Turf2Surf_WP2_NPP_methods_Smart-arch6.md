# Site identification and plot location

- Purpose
  - Provide standardized methods to locate, establish, and re-find vegetation plots across diverse habitats for consistent data collection on biomass production, plant community composition, and related productivity metrics.
  - Facilitate integration with other datasets (e.g., Bunce Woodland survey, Countryside Survey plots) through comparable plot designs (notably nested plots).

- General plot strategy
  - Nested plot architecture
    - Main plots: large fixed areas (e.g., 14.14 m x 14.14 m in woodland contexts) to enable joint analysis with existing surveys.
    - Sub-plots: smaller 1 m x 1 m plots within each main plot, positioned randomly and at least 3 m apart.
  - Plot placement principles
    - Randomization within predefined habitat boundaries.
    - Orientation standardized to north–south for consistency.
    - Clear marking and documentation to minimize trampling and enable accurate re-finding in summer.

- Data and documentation outcomes
  - Precise spatial data: GPS coordinates, pacing-derived distances, compass bearings.
  - Referencing aids: sketch maps, reference features (fences, gates, pheasant pens), and temporary/permanent markers (marker canes, wooden posts) to refind plots across seasons.
  - Visual and measurement records: baseline and post-cut photographs, plot numbers, and photo numbers linked to dates.

- Seasonal and habitat-specific planning
  - Winter, spring, summer, and autumn visits are tailored to each habitat type (grazed grasslands, unenclosed calcareous/acid grasslands, montane heath, woodlands, bogs/heaths with graminoids, and dwarf shrubs).
  - Protocols specify how to establish habitat patches, calculate area if needed, and lay out coordinates for multiple plots within a site.

- Data collection approach per plot (consistency across habitats)
  - Orientation and plot setup: align plots N–S, lay out 1x1 m sub-plots, photograph, and record GPS.
  - Biomass sampling: remove overhanging biomass, cut herbaceous vegetation in sub-plots to 1 cm, photograph post-cut, weigh fresh biomass, collect grab samples, and record weights.
  - Exclosures and markers: install exclosures after cutting if grazing is present; use marker canes or posts when exclosures are not used.
  - Re-foundation: during each revisit, locate marker/cane or exclosure, re-establish the 1x1 m quadrat with minimal trampling.
  - Annual workflow emphasis: ensure data integrity across multiple visits (winter, spring, summer, autumn) with consistent steps for cutting, weighing, sampling, and photographing.

- Specific habitat protocols highlighted
  - Grazed grasslands (enclosed) vs. unenclosed grasslands
    - Enclosures installed/removed in relation to stock presence; standardized cutting to 1 cm; repeated measurements across plots.
    - Autun/ autumn timing tailored to regrowth and second harvest considerations.
  - Grasslands supporting calcareous and acidic substrates
    - Similar 1x1 m sub-plot approach but with grid-based location when boundaries are diffuse.
  - Montane habitats
    - Use of fixed reference points (e.g., ridge locations) with multiple small inverted hanging baskets; focused on cutting decisions and species identification.
  - Woodlands
    - Two 14.14 m x 14.14 m plots with sub-plots; vegetation census including understorey; DBH measurements for trees/shrubs; litter buckets installed to sample leaf litter monthly; tree coring for annual wood increment; leaf production estimates in Sitka spruce plantations.
  - Sphagnum, bogs, and heath (graminoids)
    - Patches identified and cranked wires installed to measure growth increments; counts of capitula for density estimates; quarterly measurements over two years.
  - Pleurocarpous mosses
    - Use of plastic mesh over mats to quantify annual moss production; processing includes drying and weighing, with density-based conversion to annual production per m2.
  - Dwarf shrubs in heath patches
    - Patch selection across a burn-age chronosequence; 1x1 m plots with cutting to 1 cm; tissue sampling for N and P; biomass weighing.
  - Litter production
    - Litter buckets installed (random locations within plots) and emptied monthly; drying and weighing to estimate mass per bucket and per plot.
  - Tree growth and wood production calculations
    - Tree cores collected at 1.3 m height for annual increment analysis; wood density and form factor incorporated into woody mass calculations.
  - Leaf production in conifer plantations
    - Estimation of annual leaf production based on crown volume, branch counts, and measurement of new season leaf mass.
  - aNPP and related productivity calculations
    - aNPP calculated from grab sample dry mass and harvested fresh mass per 1 m2 harvest; example formula provided to convert to per-year productivity.
  - Sphagnum productivity specifics
    - Capitula density and stem weights used to compute annual growth per area; multiple sites targeted for patch-level replication.

- Key data outputs and calculations to expect
  - Spatial data: plot IDs, sub-plot IDs, GPS coordinates, sketch maps, and reference features.
  - Biophysical measurements: fresh mass, dry mass estimates, grab sample weights, DBH/H, tree height, and crown features.
  - Temporal records: dates of each visit, photo numbers, and timing relative to grazing or cutting events.
  - Biological sampling: soil P and N, plant tissue P and N, and LICOR measurements of photosynthetic rate for dominant species.
  - Special productivity metrics: Sphagnum stem extension, capitulum counts, litter bucket masses, and moss mat productivity.

- Data quality and repeatability considerations
  - Emphasis on minimizing trampling and maintaining plot integrity across seasons.
  - Consistent marking, GPS logging, and precise sub-plot placement to enable reliable re-sampling.
  - Standardized cutting height (1 cm) and uniform sampling protocols to ensure comparability across plots and habitats.

- References and foundational methods
  - Core references include standard methods for measuring primary production, Sphagnum growth, and tree-ring based wood increment, as well as prior surveys (e.g., Bunce Woodland survey, CS plots) used for cross-site comparability.
