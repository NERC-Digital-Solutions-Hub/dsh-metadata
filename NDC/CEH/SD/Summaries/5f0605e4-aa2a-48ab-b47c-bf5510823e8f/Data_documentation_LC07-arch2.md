# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (2007)

- A shapefile containing 45 Land Class areas across Great Britain, stratified by environmental characteristics such as climate, altitude, and slope.
- Each area is a Land Class with codes and descriptions to support standardized environmental classification and monitoring.

## Data Format and Scope

- Format: Shapefile
- Extent: Great Britain
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system / Projection: British National Grid (OSGB1936), Transverse Mercator
- Fields:
  - LC2007: Land Class Number (2007)
  - LC2007_COD: Land Class Code (2007)

## Land Class Descriptions

- The dataset provides 45 land classes with descriptive names reflecting major landforms and coastal/river environments.
- Examples of themes include flood plains/shallow valleys, flat plains, flat/coastal plains, upland valleys, sea cliffs/hard coast, estuarine/coastal types, high mountain summits/ridges, and various river valley and valley-to-plateau gradients.
- The codes are hierarchical and include country-specific distinctions (England, Scotland, Wales) to capture regional variation in landforms.

## Technical Details

- Source and purpose: Part of the Countryside Survey series; used for standardized environmental classification and monitoring across GB.
- Documentation and related work: Includes extensive supporting literature detailing sampling strategies and classification validity (e.g., Barr 1998; Bunce et al. 1982, 1991, 1996; Howard et al. 1998; Clarke et al. 2006).

## Applications for Environmental Monitoring

- Facilitates consistent reporting of environmental health and policy performance over time by providing a standardized land classification framework.
- Useful for mapping, data integration, and cross-time comparisons in environmental monitoring programs.

## Data Access and Stewardship

- Maintained by the Countryside Survey lineage (ITE/CEH); intended for storage, QA, and sharing within standard monitoring portals and datasets.
- The classification supports the broader aim of increasing dataset value and enabling access to underlying data for broader use.
