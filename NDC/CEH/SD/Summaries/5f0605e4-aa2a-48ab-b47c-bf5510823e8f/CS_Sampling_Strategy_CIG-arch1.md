# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- The document outlines the evolution of the sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification used to underpin Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 to 2007, highlighting how stratification and classification shaped national, regional, and country-specific estimates.

## Core concepts and purpose

- Objective: develop a stratified, random sampling framework to obtain representative ecological data for Great Britain and its constituent countries.
- Stratification basis: the ITE Land Classification, built from environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to create land classes that capture ecological variation.
- Trade-off addressed: avoid bias from pure random sampling by using stratified sampling to ensure all parts of the population are represented.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification

- Early approach (1970s): use environmental attributes to classify land into discrete classes; central idea originated from work in the Lake District and Cumbria.
- 32 original Land Classes: defined by environmental characteristics; central squares (1 km) classified, plus surrounding squares, yielding a total of 6,039 classified km squares in the initial framework.
- Basis for initial sampling: 8 samples per Land Class (256 total) for CS1978; national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class multiplied by the class area.
- 1984 expansion: sample size increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); additional 128 squares added to improve national estimates.
- 1990 shift: Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; results linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998 revision: classification expanded to enable separate Scottish reporting; total Land Classes increased to 40.

## CS1990 and subsequent refinements

- CS1990: continued use of Land Classification, but with adjustments to account for all GB squares; urban and sea corrections applied.
- 1990–1993 outputs: Countryside Survey 1990 main report published; results formed the basis for national habitat estimates.

## CS2000: separate country estimates and expanded sampling

- Motivation: policy needs demanded reliable England, Scotland, and Wales estimates, with different classes and distributions across countries.
- Key changes:
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (England with Wales, Scotland).
  - Rebalanced class distribution to 40 strata (from 32) through subdivision and aggregation.
  - Additional squares: 19 new squares to ensure representation of new classes; 11 more to harmonize England and Wales sampling rates.
  - Wales-focused refinements: sub-division of Land Class 17 in Wales to improve Wales estimates.
  - Isle of Man: replaced two IOM squares with two England squares for country-unit reporting.
- Uplands module: an additional module added, placing 30 squares in upland/marginal upland Land Classes to boost estiamtion precision for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Summary numbers (CS2000):
  - England & Wales (combined) across classes: total sample sizes in the hundreds per class, with overall GB totals showing 569 (CS2000) vs 506 (CS1990) for England & Wales combined.
  - Overall GB total: ~234,352 squares classified; ~569 squares sampled in CS2000.

## CS2007: Wales-focused reporting and final adjustments

- Motivation: after devolution, Wales-specific habitat status and change information became a priority; needed Wales-only precision.
- Major adjustments:
  - Country-unit sub-divisions expanded, creating five new Wales/England country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Total strata increased to 45.
  - Wales: 43 additional squares added to ensure adequate representation in the new Welsh classes (minimum 6 squares in each Welsh class); Wales sampling increased to 107 squares.
  - England: no offsetting increase; two English classes (5e, 15e) left with 4 squares per class (deemed acceptable per scoping study).
  - Scotland: sampling structure adjusted to align with Wales/England changes.
- Summary numbers (CS2007):
  - England: 288 sample squares; Scotland: 196; Wales: 107.
  - Total GB sample squares across all classes: 591.
  - The updated Land Classification maps reflect England with Wales and Scotland for the CS2007 framework.

## National estimates and data usage

- How estimates are produced:
  - Estimates are derived by combining the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total area occupied by that class.
  - Changes in Land Classification across surveys can affect the consistency of national estimates; two approaches exist:
    - Use the latest country-specific classification for estimates within that survey.
    - Use the original (1990) Land Classification for cross-survey consistency.
  - The 2006 scoping study recommended using the latest country-specific classification for within-survey estimates, while acknowledging cross-survey comparability challenges.
- Data scope and availability:
  - The methodology emphasizes documenting data sources, ensuring traceability of classifications, and maintaining metadata for discoverability.
  - Large multi-class and multi-country frameworks require careful handling of class subdivisions, aggregations, and sample allocations to maintain statistical rigor.

## Timeline at a glance (key milestones)

- 1978: Initial Land Classification; 32 classes; 256 sample squares; 8 per class.

- 1990: All-Squares Land Classification; 508 squares; linkage to Land Cover mapping; 3rd field survey.
- 1998: Revised Land Classification; 40 classes; Scotland reporting enabled.
- 2000: CS2000; country-unit estimates; expanded sampling to address England/Wales and Scotland specifics; uplands module introduced.
- 2007: CS2007; Wales-focused adjustments; 45 strata; Wales sampling up to 107; England and Scotland adjusted accordingly.
