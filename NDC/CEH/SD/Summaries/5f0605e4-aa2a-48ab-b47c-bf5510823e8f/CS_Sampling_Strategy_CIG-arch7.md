# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Chronicles the development of the ITE Land Classification and its use as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes the long-running, linked lineage of methodologies and the central role of stratification in producing representative national and country-level habitat estimates.
- Describes how classifications have evolved, how samples were allocated, and how national estimates are calculated and harmonized across time and political boundaries (England, Wales, Scotland).

## Key concepts: stratification and the ITE Land Classification
- Stratified, random sampling is used to ensure samples represent the full range of land types and ecological variation.
- The ITE Land Classification converts environmental attributes into defined land classes to serve as strata for sampling.
- Each sample square is a 1 km2 unit; early work used center squares of a 15 × 15 km grid, then extended to classify surrounding squares.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification
- The Beginning (early 1970s)
  - Bunce and Shaw developed a national ecological sampling approach using 1 km squares and stratification to ensure representativeness.
- The importance of stratification
  - Stratification reduces bias and improves representativeness across diverse landscapes and ecological processes.
- First version (mid-1970s to 1978)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) applied to environmental attributes to create 32 land classes from 1228 center squares; surrounding 4 squares per center added to classification.
  - Final classified set: 6039 km2 encompassed; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class) for the initial national survey.
- 1984 update
  - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (384 total), retaining the 1978 framework but increasing sample size.
- 1990: All Squares Land Classification
  - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB (from satellite imagery) for broader context.
- 1998–2000: Revisions for regional and policy needs
  - Attempts to classify all GB squares with surrogates for climatic/geological factors; 40 classes created to improve regional estimates.
  - Introduced separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) to support policy and legislation needs; 40 strata became 40–45 with subdivisions and aggregations.
  - Wales became a focus due to devolved policy interests; Wales was subdivided into new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Additional sampling allocated to improve representation in Wales; some adjustments to maintain comparability and precision in England.
- 2007: Welsh-only reporting and upland focus
  - Wales-specific reporting requirements led to further class subdivisions and an expanded Wales sampling frame.
  - Net result: 45 strata; 43 additional Welsh squares; some English classes reduced to 4 squares per class.
  - Introduction of an uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.

## The Sampling Framework and CS surveys
- CS1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
  - 32 land classes; 8 squares per class; 256 total field squares.
  - Habitat areas estimated by class proportions and square-level means.
- CS1984 (Second field survey)
  - 12 km2 squares per class; about 384 total squares.
- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
  - Classification applied to all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Reassessed previous data and repeated key vegetation/quadrat measurements.
- CS2000 (Developments of the Land Classification)
  - Rebalancing for policy-relevant estimates; separate country estimates formalized.
  - Added samples to ensure adequate representation of new classes; introduced country-unit subdivisions and aggregations; upland habitat sampling module added.
- CS2007 (Developments of the Land Classification)
  - Wales-focused reporting refined; five new Wales-specific sub-classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - 45 strata total; 43 Welsh extra squares; maintained precision with balanced sampling across countries.
  - England saw some classes with 4 squares per class; upland sampling module continued to improve estimates.

## Country-specific considerations
- England & Wales
  - Early framework used cross-border classifications; later CS2000 adjusted to allow England & Wales country-unit estimates.
  - Changes included class subdivisions and aggregations to ensure adequate representation per country.
- Scotland
  - Scotland-specific classifications and sampling adjustments implemented to support Scotland-only reporting.
- Wales-only reporting
  - Welsh needs drove the creation of Welsh-specific land classes and additional sampling to ensure robust Wales-only estimates for CS2007.

## Uplands module
- An additional CS2000 module added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland land classes.
- Improves statistical precision for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales where country-based reporting is required.

## Data, estimation, and methodological notes
- National estimates are derived by combining class-level information with area and mean habitat values per class.
- Changing the underlying land classification affects cross-survey comparability; the report notes that using the latest classification for national estimates is preferred for consistency, while older classifications are informative for cross-survey comparisons.
- Tables and figures (e.g., class maps, sampling maps) illustrate how land classes and sample squares are distributed and how the sampling framework evolved over time.
