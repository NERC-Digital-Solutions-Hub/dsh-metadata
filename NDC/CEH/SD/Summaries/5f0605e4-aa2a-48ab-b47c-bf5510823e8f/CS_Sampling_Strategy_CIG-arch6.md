# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the sampling strategy for the Countryside Survey field component and how the ITE Land Classification has evolved to support ecological surveying across Great Britain.
  - Emphasizes the link between stratification, representativeness, and the ability to estimate habitat areas and detect change over time.
  - Demonstrates how data products (e.g., habitat estimates, change statistics) are produced and updated across surveys.

- Core concepts and methodology
  - ITE Land Classification as the stratification framework: classifies land into discrete, homogeneous units to ensure representative sampling.
  - Use of stratified, random sampling to minimize bias and improve precision of national estimates.
  - Sample unit: 1 km square, chosen to balance geographic coverage with field survey practicality.
  - Early approach used centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; classified a core set, with surrounding squares reclassified to align with ISA-based vegetation typing and environmental attributes.
  - National estimates are derived by combining class-level data: mean habitat area per square within a class multiplied by the total area of that class.

- Timeline of the sampling framework and land classification
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification; 1st field survey)
    - ISA used to produce 32 land classes from 1228 classified squares; 8 samples per class (256 total squares).
    - Expanded to 6039 km2 classified when including surrounding squares.
  - 1984 (2nd field survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the 32-class framework.
  - 1990 (3rd field survey; All Squares Land Classification)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Added Land Cover Map linkage; repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping.
  - 1998 (4th field survey; Revised Land Classification)
    - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to improve regional estimates, with Scotland reporting separated.
  - 2000 (5th field survey; CS2000)
    - Implemented separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) using country-unit versions of land classes.
    - 40 strata structure retained, with subdivisions and aggregations to ensure adequate country representation.
    - Additional squares added to maintain representation; uplands module introduced (30 squares) to improve upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Wales adjustments)
    - Wales-focused reporting required; Welsh sub-divisions added (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total Welsh representation increased (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class); England adjustments limited, with two classes remaining at four squares.
    - Wales became the most intensively sampled country for CS2007, supporting Wales-only environmental policy reporting.

- Land Classification evolution and country-specific reporting
  - Original 32 classes (1978) evolved into 40 classes (1990) and then about 45 with Wales adjustments (2007).
  - To support country-level estimates, land classes were subdivided into England/Wales units and Scotland-specific maps; class distributions and sample allocations adjusted accordingly.
  - Wales-specific adjustments included dedicated Welsh classes and targeted additional sampling to improve Wales-only precision.

- Uplands module and data quantity
  - 2000 CS added an uplands module: an additional 30 squares in upland/marginal upland land classes to enhance habitat estimates in upland areas.
  - This module improved statistical accuracy for upland habitat reporting within England and Wales.

- Data outputs and national estimates
  - Across surveys, national estimates are calculated from class-level data and the known area of each Land Class, with adjustments for country-specific reporting.
  - Changes in Land Classification over time affect cross-survey comparability; the report discusses maintaining consistency for GB-wide estimates versus using the latest classification for survey-specific estimates.
  - Reference materials detail the precise sample sizes by class and country for CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, illustrating how sampling rate and stratification evolved to meet policy and reporting needs.
