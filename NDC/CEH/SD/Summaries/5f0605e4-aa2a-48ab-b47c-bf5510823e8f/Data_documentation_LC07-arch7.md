# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (2007)

## Overview
- Shapefile containing 45 Land Class areas across Great Britain, stratified by environmental characteristics such as climate, altitude, and slope.
- Each area is a Land Class with corresponding codes and descriptions.

## Data and format

- Columns:
  - LC2007 – ITE Land Class Number (2007)
  - LC2007_COD – ITE Land Class Code (2007)
- Resolution: 1 km
- Extent: Great Britain

## Classification details
- 45 land classes with unique codes and descriptive names
- Country-specific variants indicated by suffixes (e.g., England, Scotland, Wales)
- Example themes include flood plains, coastal plains, sea cliffs, upland valleys, intermediate/mountain tops, and other major landscape types

## Representative examples (illustrative only)
- Flood plains/shallow valleys (England)
- Flat coastal/river-valley plains
- Sea cliffs/hard coast
- Intermediate mountain tops/broad ridges
- High mountain summits/ridges
- Upland valleys/low mountains
- Flat river valleys/lower hill slopes
- Shallow valleys/low hill plateaux

Note: The full mapping consists of 45 distinct classes with detailed LC2007 and LC2007_COD entries; refer to the dataset metadata for the complete list.

## Usage notes for GIS work
- Suitable for 1 km-scale map-based analyses and broad landscape classification.
- May require data cleaning, integration, or resampling when used with higher-resolution datasets.
- Provides a standardized framework for comparing landscape types across England, Scotland, and Wales.
