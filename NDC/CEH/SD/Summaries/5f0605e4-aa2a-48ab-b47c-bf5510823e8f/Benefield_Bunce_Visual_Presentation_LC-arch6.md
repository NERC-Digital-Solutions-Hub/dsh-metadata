# A PRELIMINARY VISUAL PRESENTATION OF LAND CLASSES IN BRITAIN

- Purpose and context
  - Explores appreciation of landscape and attempts to distinguish natural units through objective landscape evaluation.
  - Builds on a development of landscape classification methods and aims to provide an objective framework for describing British landscapes.
  - Seeks to supplement quantitative land descriptions with visual representations to aid understanding and communication.

- Data and classification framework
  - Britain-wide land classification identifies 32 land classes with known area and distribution.
  - Primary and subsidiary landscape trends are derived from map information and refined with field surveys (vegetation, soils, land uses, etc.).
  - Data used to describe current ecological and land-use characteristics, support county-level surveys, assess productivity, monitor changes, and inform planning.

- Visual presentation approach
  - Aims to translate descriptions into visual form (landscape appearance) via collages that express typical class composition.
  - Two main information sources for each class: three representative photographs and mean values/descriptions from Merlewood R&D Paper No. 86.
  - Process involves creating rough sketches, then refining to avoid overemphasizing any single feature; acknowledges difficulty in accurately representing highly variable classes.

- Relationship to landscape evaluation methods
  - Builds on prior work and discussions of objective techniques (e.g., Linton, Gilg, Duffield & Owen, Tandy, Robinson et al.) and integrates descriptive judgement where necessary.
  - Emphasizes bridging objective data with perceptual (visual) interpretation to communicate landscape character.

- Outputs and applications
  - Provides an objective framework to describe the range of British landscapes; used to illustrate landscape types beyond textual descriptions.
  - Supports regional planning and detailed surveys by offering a standardized classification basis.
  - Used in past and ongoing projects (e.g., assessing land availability for wood-energy plantations) to develop scenarios of different exploitation intensities.

- Geographic and class characteristics
  - Classes cover diverse geographies (southern England, Wales, Scotland) and include a range of land forms (uplands, lowlands, coast, river valleys, plateaus, moorlands).
  - Descriptions include land form, topography, landscape character, land use, soils, vegetation, and general geography for each class.
  - Some classes are more homogeneous (e.g., open plains, coastal margins) while others are highly variable (presenting representation challenges).

- Limitations and challenges
  - Translating complex, variable landscapes into idealized, visual representations can be imperfect; some classes may not be adequately depicted due to internal variability.
  - Distinguishing between what is there and what is liked (objective vs subjective interpretation) remains a core issue.

- Dissemination and context
  - Merlewood Research and Development Papers are intended for internal Institute use and dissemination; outputs should be cited with reference to authors.
  - The visual presentation complements the quantitative land-class descriptions provided in earlier work (R&D Paper No. 86) and is part of a broader effort to document Britain’s landscapes.
