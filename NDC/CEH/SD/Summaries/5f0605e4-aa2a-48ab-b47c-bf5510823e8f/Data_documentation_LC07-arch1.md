# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (2007)

## Overview
- A Land Classification system describing 45 land classes across Great Britain, stratified by environmental characteristics such as climate, altitude, and slope.
- Provided as a shapefile at 1 km resolution, designed for use in Countryside Survey and related ecological analyses.

## Data format and structure
- File format: Shapefile.
- Coverage: Great Britain, 45 land classes.
- Core attributes:
  - LC2007: Land Class Number (2007)
  - LC2007_COD: Land Class Code (2007)
- Spatial details:
  - Resolution: 1 km
  - Coordinate system / Projection: British National Grid, OSGB36 (Transverse Mercator)
- Source and rights: Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology

## Land Class coding and naming
- The dataset includes 45 Land Classes with codes that differentiate by region (England, Scotland, Wales) and landscape type.
  - England examples include codes with an “e” suffix (e.g., 1e, 2e, …).
  - Scotland examples include codes with an “s” suffix (e.g., 7s, 13s, 18s, 19s, 21s, 22s, 23s, 24s, 25s, 26s, 27s, 28s, 29s, 30s, 31s, 32s).
  - Wales examples include codes like 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 and additional regional suffixes (e.g., 17, 18 for Wales variants).
- Names describe landscape types (e.g., flood plains/shallow valleys, flat plains, upland valleys, coastal plains, sea cliffs/hard coast, mountain tops, river floodplains, etc.). A complete mapping of codes to descriptive names is provided in the accompanying listing.

## Spatial coverage and scale
- Extent: Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales); excludes Northern Ireland.
- Scale/resolution: 1 km grid cells; suitable for regional to national analyses rather than fine-grained local management.

## Provenance and related literature
- Designed for Countryside Survey and related ecological assessments.
- Supporting documentation and key references include:
  - Barr, C.J. (1998) and Wood, C.M. (2011) on the Countryside Survey sampling strategy
  - Bunce et al. (1991, 1996a, 1996b) on ITE Land Classification development
  - Howard, Barr, Scott (1998); Clarke, Howard, Scott (2006) on validation and Wales-specific preparations
  - Several related papers in Journal of Biogeography and Journal of Environmental Management

## How this supports analysis
- Enables stratification of GB land cover into standardized landscape classes for:
  - Correlation analyses with ecological indicators
  - Predictive modelling of land-use or habitat distribution
  - Integration with other environmental datasets at the 1 km scale

## Usage notes and caveats
- Data at 1 km resolution; not suited for very fine-scale or site-specific decisions.
- Classification relies on historical methodologies tied to Countryside Survey (up to 2007); check for newer versions if available.
- The mapping to narrative class names is extensive; refer to the full 45-class listing for exact category definitions and regional variants.
