# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (2007)

## Overview
- A land classification shapefile for Great Britain (2007) identifying 45 land classes stratified by environmental characteristics such as climate, altitude, and slope.
- Aimed at enabling spatial analysis and data-driven understanding of GB landscape types.

## Data format and structure
- Format: Shapefile containing 45 Land Class areas.
- Each area represents a distinct land class (Land Class 2007) with corresponding code (LC2007_COD).
- Resolution: 1 km.
- Extent: Great Britain.
- Projection and coordinate system: British National Grid (OSGB36), Transverse Mercator.

## Classification details
- 45 land classes are described with regionally tailored codes and descriptive names (e.g., England, Scotland, Wales variants).
- The class codes reflect diverse environments, including flood plains, flat plains, coastal plains, valley systems, upland valleys, mountain tops, sea cliffs, estuarine/coastal zones, etc.
- The document provides detailed mappings and long-form names for each class, illustrating the broad spectrum of GB landscapes covered by the classification.

## Spatial reference and extent
- Name: ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (2007)
- Data source: Countryside Survey data (© NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Extent: Great Britain (with region-specific classifications for England, Scotland, and Wales).

## Data lineage and references
- Supporting documentation and related methodological literature accompany the dataset, including:
  - The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey and its revisions
  - Studies on visual presentation, classification of 1 km squares, and validation of using survey data for broader land cover estimates
- Key authors and works cited provide context for the sampling design, classification framework, and validity assessments.

## Potential uses and data products
- Create regional or national land-class maps at 1 km resolution.
- Support environmental planning, policy development, and ecological research by providing a consistent GB-wide landscape typology.
- Serve as a base layer for combining with other datasets (land cover, climate, biodiversity) to explore patterns and inform decision-making.
- Facilitate data-driven communication and interpretation of landscape structure to non-specialist audiences.

## Notes and considerations
- Version information: Document Version 1: 7-9-2012.
- Source and access: Countryside Survey data; dataset intended for broad use in policy and research contexts.
- Users may need to translate region-specific codes (e.g., England, Scotland, Wales variants) to a consistent GB-wide schema for cross-border analyses.
