# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (2007)

- Overview
  - A shapefile dataset containing 45 land class areas in Great Britain, stratified by environmental characteristics such as climate, altitude, and slope.
  - Land Class descriptions are provided for interpretation.
  - Data are © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (Countryside Survey data).

- Data specifications
  - Format: Shapefile
  - Extent: Great Britain
  - Resolution: 1 km
  - Coordinate system / Projection: British National Grid (OSGB36), Transverse Mercator
  - Columns:
    - LC2007: ITE Land Class Number (2007)
    - LC2007_COD: ITE Land Class Code (2007)

- Content details
  - 45 land class areas across England, Scotland, and Wales, each identified by codes and descriptive names.
  - Summary names and codes indicate a regionalized Land Classification scheme (e.g., England, Scotland, Wales with 1e/2e style subclassifications).

- Metadata and provenance
  - Supporting literature available, including the sampling strategy and various foundational papers (Barr 1998; Bunce et al. 1982, 1991, 1996; Howard et al. 1998; Clarke et al. 2006; and others).
  - Documentation provides context for classification methodology and validation.

- Data governance and stewardship considerations
  - Provenance: Countryside Survey data attributed to NERC CEH; appropriate citation and license requirements apply.
  - Metadata quality: Essential to maintain LC2007 and LC2007_COD mappings, 1 km resolution, and OSGB36 projection for interoperability with other GB geospatial datasets.
  - Data quality and standards: Requires ongoing quality assurance of classification accuracy, consistency of metadata, and alignment with related datasets and updates.
  - Access and sharing: Should be prepared for portal deposition with appropriate documentation; consider data sharing limitations and any embargo or proprietary constraints as part of governance.
  - Documentation: Include work done (transformations, quality checks) to support reproducibility and reuse.

- Practical relevance for data stewards
  - Serves as a standardized GB-wide land classification reference suitable for ecological and landscape analyses.
  - Facilitates cross-dataset integration through consistent CRS (OSGB36) and 1 km resolution.
  - Requires careful maintenance of class codes and descriptions to preserve interpretability across users and over time.
