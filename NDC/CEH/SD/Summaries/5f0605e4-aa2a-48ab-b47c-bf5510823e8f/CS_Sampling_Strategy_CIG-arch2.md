# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Aim and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Grounded in the ITE (Institute of Terrestrial Ecology) Land Classification, evolving over ~30 years.
  - Designed to produce time-series data to detect change and support policy-relevant environmental reporting.

- Core concept: stratified sampling using the ITE Land Classification
  - To avoid bias and ensure representativeness, samples are drawn from well-defined strata (land classes).
  - Stratification accounts for multiple ecological drivers (not just simple altitude), recognizing regional variation (e.g., uplands vs lowlands, coastal vs inland, country-level differences).

- The ITE Land Classification: historical development
  - 1970s: Origin of a stratified 1 km square sampling framework using environmental attributes to define 32 land classes (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; surrounding squares added for each class).
  - 1978 CS framework: 256 squares surveyed (8 per class) to estimate national habitat areas.
  - 1984: Land-use emphasis; 12 squares per class (384 total); national estimates still linked to the earlier 1978 classification.
  - 1990: All-Squares Land Classification introduced; GB-wide coverage of 1 km squares (508 squares surveyed); linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1998: Land Classification updated to enable separate Scottish reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40; field survey expanded to 569 squares.
  - 2000: CS2000 further refined the framework to support country-specific estimates (England & Wales together, Scotland separately) with 40 strata expanded to 45; additional sampling to ensure representation of new classes; uplands module introduced.
  - 2007: CS2007 introduced Wales-only reporting adjustments; England-only reporting retained; country-unit splits expanded to 45 strata (with new Welsh sub-classes); additional Welsh squares added for balanced representation; upland sampling further refined.

- Sampling framework and methods by survey stage
  - Centered on 1 km squares classified by the ITE Land Classification; strata are defined by land class and country.
  - Sampling within each class is proportional to extent; random selection within strata to ensure representativeness.
  - Field surveys have repeatedly targeted a fixed number of squares per class, with adjustments over time to improve country-specific precision and to accommodate devolved government needs.

- Country-specific reporting and class subdivisions
  - England & Wales reporting introduced separate country estimates; England and Wales share a refined set of country-unit land classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w in CS2007).
  - Scotland continues to be reported separately; Wales receives particular attention to enable Wales-only habitat status and policy reporting.
  - Isle of Man samples are not used for country-unit estimates and were replaced in some years to align with country reporting needs.

- Uplands and additional modules
  - An uplands module (CS2000) added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland ITE Land Classes for better accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
  - This supports more reliable, country-specific habitat region estimates alongside the main GB-wide assessments.

- Data outputs, interpretation, and consistency notes
  - Outputs include habitat area estimates, maps, and other feature statistics derived from the stratified samples.
  - National estimates can be derived using the latest classification, while cross-survey consistency may favor using the classification aligned to the survey period.
  - The document notes that changing the basic land classification affects the comparability of national estimates; thus, guidance favors a consistent approach within a given survey while allowing comparability across surveys with careful methodology.

- Summary of survey counts (illustrative)
  - CS1978: initial 256 squares (32 classes; 8 per class).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class; adjustments in class usage).
  - CS1990: 508 squares; all GB squares classified; use of a GB-wide Land Classification with broader data.
  - CS2000: expansion to 40–45 strata; country-unit reporting introduced; upland module added; more squares allocated to ensure representation of new classes.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused adjustments; Wales gets additional classes and samples; England retains adequate precision with some classes at fewer squares; expanded country-unit framework to 45 strata.

- Acknowledged context and references
  - Development of the ITE Land Classification and its applications across multiple Countryside Survey iterations.
  - The document situates CS sampling within a long lineage of landscape ecological classification and national ecological monitoring.

- Practical implications for environmental monitoring
  - Provides a standardized, reproducible framework for tracking environmental change over time across Great Britain and its constituent nations.
  - Supports policy-relevant reporting by enabling country-specific habitat estimates alongside GB-wide trends.
  - Emphasizes data accessibility and cross-dataset value by maintaining a clear, documented sampling and classification approach that can be integrated with other environmental data streams.
