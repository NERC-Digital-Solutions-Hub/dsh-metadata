# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy underlying Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Shows how the ITE Land Classification evolved and directly informed sampling, stratification, and national estimates.
  - Emphasises the long time-series nature of the data and the need to understand how past classifications influence current and future surveys.

- The ITE Land Classification: background
  - Stratified sampling core idea: divide land into discrete strata to ensure representative sampling and minimise bias.
  - Early approach used an environmental-attribute based classification applied to 1 km squares, enabling ecological samples to reflect broad GB land types.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and multivariate classification formed the basis for grouping land into Land Classes, which then guided sample selection.

- Evolution of the sampling framework by survey year
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and first field survey)
    - 32 Land Classes derived from 1228 centre squares (15 x 15 km grid); eight samples per class (total 256 squares).
    - Surrounding four squares per centre classified, yielding 6039 km^2 of classified area.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per Land Class (total 384); eight squares previously visited retained.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
    - Land Classification updated to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Added integration with the first Land Cover Map from satellite data; replication of 1984 vegetation quadrats.
  - 2000 (Revised Land Classification; CS2000)
    - Framework updated to enable separate country estimates (England & Wales; Scotland).
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions, increasing strata to 40.
    - Additional squares added to improve representation of new classes; 30–40% more sampling for some classes; upland habitat sampling module introduced for better upland estimates.
  - 2007 (Developments for CS2007; Wales-focused reporting)
    - Wales reporting required, leading to further subdivisions (creating 45 strata) and Wales-specific sampling adjustments.
    - Wales received more Welsh-only squares; England’s remaining classes adjusted to maintain representativeness.
    - Additional Wales-only squares: minimum 6 squares per Welsh class; some English classes reduced to 4 squares per class where necessary.
  
- Sampling design and data structure
  - Core sampling method: stratified, random sampling across Land Classes to strike a balance between representativeness and practicality.
  - Centre-square approach: use centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; classify those and surrounding squares to form the full sample.
  - Time-series consistency: changes in Land Classification affect comparability; national estimates can be derived using different classifications, with a preference for the latest for within-survey consistency and the original for cross-survey consistency.
  - Uplands module (CS2000): included an additional 30 upland squares to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.

- National estimates and country units
  - Early surveys produced GB-wide estimates by applying mean habitat area per square within each Land Class to the total area of that class.
  - CS1990 introduced a GB-wide framework using the 1990 Land Classification; later revisions acknowledged the need for country-specific estimates (England & Wales; Scotland) and the Isle of Man’s replacement.
  - CS2000 formalised country-unit estimates via class sub-division and aggregation to ensure adequate representation within each country.
  - CS2007 refined Wales-specific reporting further, maintaining England-wide sampling adequacy while improving Wales’ precision.

- Wales, uplands, and country-specific adjustments
  - Wales-specific reporting required sub-dividing Land Classes into Wales/England versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Number of strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares added to ensure six squares per new Welsh class.
  - England’s Welsh removals were offset without a wholesale English-square increase; some English classes retained as low as four squares per class.
  - Wales upland habitat sampling expanded to improve precision for Wales-specific country estimates.

- Data governance, standards, and interpretation
  - The document notes the impact of changing Land Class schemes on the consistency of national stock estimates.
  - For internal consistency, surveys prefer using the latest Land Classification, but cross-survey consistency may require aligning analyses to the 1990 classification.
  - Tables and figures document the distribution of sample squares and strata across surveys, illustrating the evolving sampling framework and its implications for estimates.

  - Provides references to key reports and publications detailing the Land Classification, sampling design, and Countryside Survey results.

- Practical takeaway for data leaders
  - The sampling strategy demonstrates the importance of a robust, evolvable stratification framework (ITE Land Classification) to support long-term data series.
  - Country-unit stratification and Wales/Upland module additions illustrate how to adapt sampling to policy, governance, and stakeholder needs while maintaining methodological rigor.
  - Transparent documentation of classification changes and their impact on national estimates is crucial for data lineage, reproducibility, and cross-time comparability.
