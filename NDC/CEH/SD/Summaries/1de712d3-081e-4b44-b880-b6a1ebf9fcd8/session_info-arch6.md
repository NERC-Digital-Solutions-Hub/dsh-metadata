## Data Support archetype: Overview

- Aim: Help others explore data and obtain insights by finding, combining, analyzing data, and creating accessible data products (dashboards, pivot tables, reports) for self-service and broader use.
- Who they are: Data analysts who support a wide range of topics, often in less specialized organisations (e.g., local councils, private companies); strong data analysis and communication skills; may work on policy support and public data communication.
- How they meet their aims:
  - Understand the ask: determine what’s needed, why, and the best approach.
  - Source and verify sufficient data; consult topic experts when needed.
  - Clean, transform, and combine data from multiple sources; quality assure outputs.
  - Analyse patterns to identify significant features.
  - Create self-serve products (dashboards, pivot tables) and provide guidance on use; produce reports and charts; promote outputs and gather feedback.
  - Share early prototypes; advocate for better data creation where possible.
- Particular challenges:
  - Time spent understanding the ask due to limited data consideration in broader teams.
  - Patchy data across a wide range of formats and systems.
  - Difficulty communicating complex information simply.
  - Promoting outputs to drive wider use and re-use.

## R sessionInfo snapshot

- Environment: R version 3.5.3 (2019-03-11) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).
- Core focus: Demonstrates an active data analysis/setup typical for Data Support work.
- Key attached packages:
  - Data manipulation and analysis: dplyr, tidyr, purrr, readr, readxl, tibble, ggplot2, tidyverse.
  - Data display and UI: DT, shiny, shinycssloaders, htmlwidgets, plotly.
  - Miscellaneous: forcats, stringr, lubridate, rvest, haven, readxl, plyr.
- Additional namespace usage indicates reliance on a broad data science stack, including:
  - Data handling and transformation: data.table, modelr, rlang, magrittr, broom.
  - Visualization and interactivity: ggplot2, plotly, HTML/UI integration via htmltools, crosstalk.
  - Utilities and formatting: glue, purrr, tibble, stringi, jsonlite, yaml.
- Implications for practice:
  - Reflects a typical toolkit for building data products and dashboards, enabling self-service exploration and reporting.
  - Supports diverse data sources and formats, consistent with the Data Support emphasis on combining datasets and communicating results clearly.
