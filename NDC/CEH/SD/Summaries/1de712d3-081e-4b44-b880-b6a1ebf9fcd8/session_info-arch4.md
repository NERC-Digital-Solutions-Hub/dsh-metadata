## Overview for Data Leaders

- The document outlines the Data Leaders archetype: managers focused on implementing an effective data strategy, applying past analytics knowledge, and considering data’s role within wider networks or partner ecosystems.
- Emphasizes a system-wide view of data: understanding user needs, potentially fostering co-ownership of data products, and prioritising efforts based on data availability and gaps.
- Highlights practices to support data assets as products: clear data formats, quality, metadata, discoverability, and timely updates; iterative feedback to ensure user needs are met.
- Encourages collaboration within the wider data community to sustain an effective data system.
- Key challenges include understanding diverse user needs, obtaining a comprehensive overview of scattered data, data gaps at required granularity, barriers like paywalls and data protection, quick data verification, inconsistent standards and metadata, and sector coordination issues leading to duplicated effort.

## How Data Leaders meet their aims

- Think in terms of the whole data system and lifecycle.
- Engage with user needs as an ongoing process, promoting co-ownership of data products where feasible.
- Assess what data is available, identify gaps, and verify data suitability to prioritize work.
- Use multiple channels to discover data (platforms, online searches, outreach to others) and may commission new data.
- Promote good analytical, presentation, and dissemination practices within their teams.
- Ensure data assets are managed properly (format, quality, metadata, discoverability, updates).
- Iterate on products through user feedback to align with needs.
- Collaborate with the wider data community to strengthen the data ecosystem.

## Particular Challenges (detailed)

- Understanding user needs across diverse public audiences.
- Obtaining an overview of available data due to fragmentation.
- Lack of data, especially at needed granularity.
- Paywalls and data protection barriers limiting access.
- Difficulty quickly verifying data content and format.
- Absence of data standards, variable data quality, and unclear metadata.
- Coordination gaps in the sector, duplicated efforts, and limited communities of practice.
