Digestate_HF_SoilTemperature_WFPS_v1.csv

## Overview
- Supplement to the supporting documentation for data series in CINAg experiments.
- Dataset from the digestate wheat trial (2017) at Henfaes Research Center, Bangor University.
- Contains soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 2.5 cm depth across ten plots.

## Data scope and structure
- Rows: 87,980
- Columns: 4
- Plot IDs: 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 18, 24, 28, 29, 30
- Time: Date and time of day
- Measurements:
  - Soil_temperature_degrees_celsius: soil temperature at 2.5 cm depth
  - WFPS_percent: water-filled pore space at 2.5 cm depth
- Units:
  - Soil temperature: degrees Celsius
  - WFPS: percent

## Context and provenance
- Origin: Digestate wheat trial 2017
- Location: Henfaes Research Center, Bangor University
- Part of a broader data series documented for environmental monitoring and experimental assessment

## Data quality and processing considerations
- Data verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation steps are implied as part of standard monitoring workflows.
- Supplement exists to the main documentation, indicating alignment with established data standards and cataloging.

## Usage, storage, and accessibility
- Intended for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Data should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals as part of dataset management.
- Suitable for time-series analyses of soil temperature and moisture at a shallow depth under digestate treatment.

## Notes and limitations
- Depth is fixed at 2.5 cm; results pertain to a single experimental setup for 2017.
- Limited to ten plots within one site; cross-site or multi-depth comparisons would require additional data.
