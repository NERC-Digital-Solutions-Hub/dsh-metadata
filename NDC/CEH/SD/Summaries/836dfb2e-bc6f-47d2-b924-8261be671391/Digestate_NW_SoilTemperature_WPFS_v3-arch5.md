# Digestate_NF_SoilTemperature_WFPS.csv

## Overview
- Supplement to supporting documentation for data series detailed in 'Supporting_documentation_CINAg_experiments_final_check_v2.1.pdf'.
- Dataset comprises 4 columns and 31,778 rows.
- Data collected from a digestate wheat trial (2017) at North Wyke Research station, Rothamsted Research.
- Records soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) at a shallow depth (2.5 cm) across ten plots.

## Dataset structure
- Time: Date and time of day
- Block: Blocks 1 to 5
- Soil_Temperature_degrees_celcius: soil temperature at 2.5 cm depth (degrees Celsius)
- WFPS_percent: water-filled pore space at 2.5 cm soil depth (percent)

## Provenance and context
- Derived from a digestate-related wheat trial conducted in 2017.
- Location and facilities: North Wyke Research station, Rothamsted Research.
- Focus: measurements at 2.5 cm soil depth across ten plots.

## Data quality and standards considerations
- Units explicitly stated:
  - Soil temperature: degrees Celsius
  - WFPS: percent
- Clear column headers and simple explanations provided.
- Metadata depth is limited in this extract; users may need additional documentation for measurement methods, instruments, calibration, sampling intervals, and quality checks.

## Governance, availability, and updates
- Classified as a data series supplement within the CINAg experimental documentation suite.
- Should be linked with the broader supporting documentation for traceability and discoverability.
- Consider versioning and proper provenance tracking when updating or redistributing.

## Use, interpretations, and limitations
- Suitable for analyzing temporal trends in soil temperature and WFPS at 2.5 cm across ten plots.
- Time granularity and timezone details are not specified here and should be confirmed from the supporting docs.
- The dataset structure implies a block-based experimental design; users should align analyses with the Block 1–5 design descriptor.
