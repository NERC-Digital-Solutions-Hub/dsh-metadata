# Details of data structure to ' Digestate_HF_and_NW_Production.csv ' 

- Overview
  - A dataset with 7 columns and 90 rows from a 2017 digestate wheat trial conducted at two sites: Henfaes Research Center (HF) and North Wyke (NW).
  - Focuses on wheat yields and grain characteristics under various digestate and inorganic nitrogen treatments.
  - All yield data are reported at 100% dry matter; NA indicates not assessed.

- Data columns (variables)
  - Site: HF or NW
  - Plot: experimental plot number
  - Block: blocking factor in a randomized block design (values 1–5)
  - Treatment: C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI (digestate-related treatments) and N-75, N-150, N-225, N-300 (inorganic NH4NO3 N addition rates)
    - C = zero N control
    - D = digestate
    - AD = acidified digestate
    - DNI = digestate with nitrification inhibitor (DMPP)
    - ADNI = acidified digestate with nitrification inhibitor (DMPP)
  - Plant_yield: whole plant yield at 100% dry matter (tonnes per hectare, t ha^-1)
  - Grain_yield: grain yield at 100% dry matter (t ha^-1)
  - TGW: thousand grain weight at 100% dry matter (grams)

- Experimental design and context
  - Randomized block design with blocks numbered 1–5 (Block).
  - Treatments include both digestate-based options and inorganic nitrogen addition at multiple rates (N-75 to N-300).
  - Two sites with potentially different plot sizing and management practices.

- Plot dimensions
  - HF:
    - For nitrogen addition rate treatments: harvest area plots are 1.2 m × 6.5 m
    - For C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI: harvest area plots are 1.2 m × 14 m
  - NW:
    - For nitrogen addition rate treatments: harvest area plots are 2 m × 4.5 m
    - For C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI: harvest area plots are 2 m × 9 m

- Purpose and potential analyses
  - Compare effects of digestate treatments (D, AD, DNI, ADNI) against zero N control (C) and inorganic N rates on plant and grain yield.
  - Assess impact of acidification and nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) on yields.
  - Examine relationships between treatments and TGW alongside yield.
  - Facilitate cross-site comparisons (HF vs NW) and evaluation of scale effects due to differing plot sizes.
  - Support data-driven questions about correlations and predictions regarding the likely impact of digestate-based and inorganic N inputs on wheat production.
