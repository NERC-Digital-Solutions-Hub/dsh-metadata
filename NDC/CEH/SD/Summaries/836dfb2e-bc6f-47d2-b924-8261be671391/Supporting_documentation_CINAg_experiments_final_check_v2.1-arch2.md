# Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy Supporting documentation for data

- A multi-country project (CINAg) combining China and the UK to optimise farm practices and soil management for more effective use of nitrogen sources and reduced Nr losses to the environment.
- Project aims to improve agronomic NUE, develop holistic soil health metrics, test on-field practices, and translate findings to farmers through established programmes.

## Project Aims and Structure

- Develop novel indicators of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and real-time physical/chemical soil metrics to inform farm practices and soil management.
- Test and develop on-field experiments and farm platforms for sustainable intensification of agriculture.
- Translate developments to Chinese farmers via the Science and Technology Backyard programme (CAU/CAAS).
- Work Packages (WPs):
  - WP1: Improved fundamental understanding of N cycling
  - WP2: Harnessing novel N technologies
  - WP3: Improved agronomic practices
  - WP4: Predictive capacity and knowledge exchange

## Study Design: Locations, Platforms and Sampling

- Four UK farm platforms (2016–2017): North Wyke (NW), Harpenden (HA), Henfaes Farm (HF), Easter Bush (EB).
  - North Wyke and Harpenden operated by Rothamsted Research; Henfaes by Bangor University; Easter Bush by CEH.
- 2018 UK-wide sampling: nine sites across Scotland, Wales, England with at least two land uses per site.
- Experimental focuses:
  - 2016: Inorganic fertilizer trials on grassland (NW, HF, EB).
  - 2017: Digestate trial on winter wheat (NW, HF); additional grassland trials at EB and HA.
  - 2018: UK-wide soil and biomass sampling across multiple land uses.
- Experimental designs: complete randomized blocks; multiple plots per treatment; subplots for emissions, sampling, and biomass yield; detailed plot layouts and treatments documented in appendices.

## Data Collected and Key Metrics

- Yields and biomass
  - Grass yields (tonnes DM/ha), quality metrics (crude protein, metabolisable energy, fibre fractions, D value), measured across sites with site-specific methods.
  - Winter wheat grain and straw yields, moisture, and N content; NUE calculations for crops (NUEc and NUEg).
- Plant nitrogen
  - Grass N content (converted from crude protein), N offtake, and NUE calculations using standard factor conversions.
- Greenhouse gas sampling
  - Ammonia (NH3) volatilization: wind tunnels, acid traps; cumulative NH3 emissions calculated per plot.
  - Nitrous oxide (N2O): static chambers (manual and automated) with isotopic analysis where applicable; cumulative fluxes estimated with curve-fitting and Bayesian methods; N2O expressed relative to N applied.
  - Emission modelling and dispersion approaches (FIDES model) used at some sites to derive flux estimates.
- Soil sampling and metrics (WP1/WP2)
  - 0–15 cm topsoil cores; additional depths as needed; NH4+, NO3−, amino acids, peptides, mineralisable N; KCl extraction and colorimetric/other analyses.
  - Dissolved organic C (DOC) and total dissolved N (TDN); DON calculated; microbial biomass C and N (MBC/MBN) via chloroform-kill method; aggregate size distribution; soil texture (sand/silt/clay); soil moisture and soil organic matter (SOM, LOI); pH and EC; base cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg) by extraction and ICP-OES.
  - Total soil carbon and nitrogen; total phosphorus; POXC (permanganate oxidisable C); P pools
    - Citric acid extractable P (CEH Bangor), acetic acid extractable P (WP2 proxy for plant-available P), Olsen-P (Lancaster).
  - DNA and nitrogen cycling genes
    - DNA extraction and qPCR for nifH, amoA (AOB and AOA), nirK, nirS, nosZ (clades I/II), ureC; bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS for diversity.
  - Microbial diversity and OTUs
    - Amplicon sequencing (16S and ITS) with analyses for Shannon diversity and richness; OTUs and community composition.
  - Soil hydrology and structure
    - Infiltration (infiltration disk tests) and soil water release curves (HYPRO/ HYPRO-FIT) to model hydraulic properties.
- Metadata and QA/QC
  - Standardized QA/QC across labs; reference standards; replicated analyses; LIMS data handling; cross-site data integration.

## Protocols and Data Processing

- Clear separation of protocols for WP1 (soil and process metrics) and WP2 (on-farm N technologies and treatments); sampling days standardized as much as weather allowed.
- Yields and biomass data collected by partner teams; N content and NUE calculations standardized across sites and years.
- NH3 and N2O data processing:
  - NH3: concentrations, air volumes, and wind-tunnel data used to compute emissions; cumulative NH3 calculated per treatment.
  - N2O: manual and automated chamber data analyzed with appropriate regression and Bayesian approaches; cumulative fluxes derived per fertilization period; digestion/different treatments normalised to N applied.
- Soil analyses:
  - Ammonium, nitrate, amino acids, peptides, mineralisable N; DOC/TDN; MBC/MBN; aggregates, texture, SOM, pH/EC; base cations; total C and N; P pools; POXC; P fractions; DNA/N genes; OTUs; diversity metrics.
- Data management
  - Data compiled in Excel and LIMS; QA checks by multiple staff; detailed appendices with methodological parameters, assay conditions, and calibration details.
