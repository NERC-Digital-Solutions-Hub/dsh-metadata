# Details of data structure to Digestate_NF_SoilTemperature_WFPS.csv

## Overview
- Supplement to the supporting documentation for data series described in Supporting_documentation_CINAg_experiments_final_check_v2.1.pdf
- Documents the data structure for Digestate_NF_SoilTemperature_WFPS.csv
- Data pertain to a wheat trial using digestate, conducted in 2017 at the North Wyke Research station and Rothamsted Research

## Dataset scope and provenance
- 4 columns and 31,778 rows
- Collected from ten plots at a depth of 2.5 cm
- Measurements derive from the digestate wheat trial 2017

## Variables and units
- Time: Date and time of day (timestamp)
- Block: Categorical identifier for experimental blocks, values 1 to 5
- Soil_Temperature_degrees_celcius: Soil temperature at 2.5 cm depth, in degrees Celsius
- WFPS_percent: Water-filled pore space at 2.5 cm soil depth, in percent

## Context and usage
- Data intended to support environmental monitoring analyses of soil temperature and soil moisture (WFPS) under the digestate treatment
- Structured to facilitate standardised analysis and potential integration with other environmental datasets

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and analysis
- Provides a consistent, domain-specific dataset suitable for monitoring soil conditions over time
- Enables comparative analyses across multiple plots and time points
- Supports validation and quality assurance workflows by offering explicit column definitions and units

## Considerations for data handling
- Supplemented by additional documentation (Supporting_documentation_CINAg_experiments_final_check_v2.1.pdf)
- Designed for clear interpretation and potential data sharing via appropriate data portals or repositories (aligned with standard monitoring practices)
