# Details of data structure to ' Digestate_HF_and_NW_pH_NH4_NO3_v2.csv'

- Overview
  - Supplement to the supporting documentation for data series detailed in Supporting_documentation_CINAg_experiments_final_check_v2.1.pdf
  - Describes the data structure for Digestate_HF_and_NW_pH_NH4_NO3_v2.csv
  - Dataset contains 8 columns and 950 rows from the digestate wheat trial conducted in 2017
  - Sites included: Henfaes Research Center (HF) and North Wyke (NW), with soil pH, NH4+, and NO3 data

- Dataset contents and structure
  - Columns (with explanations)
    - Site: HF or NW
    - Date: Date the soil was sampled from the field
    - Plot: Experimental plot number
    - Block: Blocking factor of the randomized block design (1–5)
    - Treatment: C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI
      - C = zero N control
      - D = digestate
      - AD = acidified digestate
      - DNI = digestate with nitrification inhibitor (DMPP)
      - ADNI = acidified digestate with DMPP
    - Soil_pH: pH of the soil sample
    - Soil_NH4_mg_kg: NH4 in the soil, mg N kg^-1 dry soil
    - Soil_NO3_mg_kg: NO3 in the soil, mg N kg^-1 dry soil
  - Units are specified for each column (e.g., Date, pH, NH4_mg_kg, NO3_mg_kg)
  - NA = Not assessed where applicable

- Experimental context
  - Derived from the digestate wheat trial conducted in 2017
  - Conducted at Henfaes Research Center, Bangor University, and North Wyke research station, Rothamsted Research
  - Focus on soil chemical responses (pH, ammonium, nitrate) to different digestate treatments

- Plot geometry and sampling details
  - HF plots: harvest areas of 1.2 m × 6.5 m for nitrogen addition rates; 1.2 m × 14 m for C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI treatments
  - NW plots: harvest areas of 2 m × 4.5 m for nitrogen addition rates; 2 m × 9 m for C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI treatments

- Data management and accessibility
  - Data are prepared for quality assurance and potential transformation to standardized outputs
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals as part of monitoring workflows

- Relevance for environmental monitoring
  - Provides a standardised dataset structure suitable for tracking soil chemistry responses over time and enabling cross-study comparisons within environmental health monitoring.
