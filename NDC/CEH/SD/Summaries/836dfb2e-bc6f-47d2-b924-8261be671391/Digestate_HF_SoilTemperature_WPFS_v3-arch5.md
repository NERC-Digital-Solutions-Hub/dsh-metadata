# Details of data structure to ' Digestate_HF_SoilTemperature_WFPS_v1.csv '

## Overview
- Supplement to the supporting documentation for data series detailed in Supporting_documentation_CINAg_experiments_final_check_v2.1.pdf.
- Dataset consists of 4 columns and 87,980 rows from the digestate wheat trial 2017 at Henfaes Research Center, Bangor University.
- Measures soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 2.5 cm soil depth.
- Covers ten plots: 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 18, 24, 28, 29, 30.

## Dataset structure (columns and units)
- Time: Date and time of day.
- Plot numbers: 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 18, 24, 28, 29, 30.
- Soil_temperature_degrees_celcius: soil temperature at 2.5 cm depth. Unit: Degrees Celsius.
- WFPS_percent: water-filled pore space at 2.5 cm soil depth. Unit: Percent.

## Provenance and context
- Data are part of the digestate wheat trial 2017.
- Collected at Henfaes Research Center, Bangor University.
- Documented as part of the CINAg experiments; this file provides data-structure details to accompany the main supporting documentation.

## Governance, access, and sharing implications for Data Stewards
- Metadata and data structure must be clearly documented to enable discovery and reuse.
- Ensure units and column names are consistent with metadata standards (e.g., Time, Plot numbers, Soil_temperature, WFPS).
- Identify data availability and any limitations (e.g., scope limited to 2.5 cm depth, ten plots, specific trial year).
- Prepare for quality assurance: verify accuracy, completeness, and formatting before sharing.
- Align with broader data governance: link this dataset to Supporting_documentation_CINAg_experiments_final_check_v2.1.pdf and upload to relevant portals; catalogue within the data holdings.

## Quality considerations and recommendations (Data Steward perspective)
- Confirm completeness and correctness of the 87,980-row time series across the ten plots.
- Standardize naming conventions (e.g., consider common spelling: degrees_celsius) and ensure consistent units across the dataset and metadata.
- Document data lineage, collection methods, and any processing steps applied to arrive at this structure.
- Note any data availability issues, embargoes, or provenance constraints that could affect sharing or reuse.
- Maintain cross-references to the supporting CINAg documentation to support user understanding.
