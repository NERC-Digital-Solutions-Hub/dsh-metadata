# Details of data structure to ' Digestate_HF_and_NW_pH_NH4_NO3_v2.csv '

## Overview
- Supplement to the supporting documentation for CINAg experiments.
- Describes the data structure for the Digestate_HF_and_NW_pH_NH4_NO3_v2.csv dataset.
- 8 columns and 950 rows of soil pH, NH4+, and NO3 data from the 2017 digestate wheat trial conducted at Henfaes Research Center (HF) and North Wyke (NW) research stations.

## Dataset composition
- Sites: HF and NW.
- Date: Date soil was sampled from the field.
- Plot: Experimental plot number.
- Block: Blocking factor of the randomized block design (values 1–5).
- Treatment: C (zero N control), D (digestate), AD (acidified digestate), DNI (digestate with nitrification inhibitor DMPP), ADNI (acidified digestate with DMPP).
- Soil_pH: pH of soil sample.
- Soil_NH4_mg_kg: NH4 in the soil, mg N per kg dry soil.
- Soil_NO3_mg_kg: NO3 in the soil, mg N per kg dry soil.

## Experimental design and sampling
- Digestate wheat trial conducted in 2017 at HF and NW.
- Block design with five blocks (1–5).
- Plot sizes differ by site and treatment context:
  - HF: nitrogen addition areas are 1.2 m × 6.5 m; for C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI, harvest area is 1.2 m × 14 m.
  - NW: nitrogen addition areas are 2 m × 4.5 m; for C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI, harvest area is 2 m × 9 m.
- Date column indicates when soil sampling occurred.

## Variables and units
- Soil_pH: pH of soil sample (unitless).
- Soil_NH4_mg_kg: NH4 concentration, mg N per kg dry soil.
- Soil_NO3_mg_kg: NO3 concentration, mg N per kg dry soil.
- Date: Sampling date.
- Plot: Experimental plot number.
- Block: Randomised block design factor.
- Treatment: C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI with defined meanings as above.

## Data handling and provenance
- Data derived from the 2017 digestate wheat trial, with site-specific details provided (HF and NW) and linked to the supporting CINAg documentation.
- NA indicates not assessed for a given entry or variable.
