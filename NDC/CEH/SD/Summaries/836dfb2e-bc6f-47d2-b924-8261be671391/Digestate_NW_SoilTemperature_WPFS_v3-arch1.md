# Digestate_NF_SoilTemperature_WFPS.csv - Data Structure

## Overview
- This document is a supplement to the supporting documentation for data series described in Supporting_documentation_CINAg_experiments_final_check_v2.1.pdf.
- It details the structure of the data file Digestate_NF_SoilTemperature_WFPS.csv, derived from the digestate wheat trial conducted in 2017.

## Dataset at a glance
- Columns: 4
- Rows: 31,778
- Source: Digestate wheat trial 2017, North Wyke Research station, Rothamsted Research
- Measurements: Soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS) at a depth of 2.5 cm
- Plots: Ten plots
- Depth: 2.5 cm

## Columns and units
- Time: Date and time of day
- Block: Blocks 1 to 5
- Soil_Temperature_degrees_celcius: Soil temperature at 2.5 cm depth (Degrees Celsius)
- WFPS_percent: Water-filled pore space at 2.5 cm soil depth (Percent)

## Data provenance and context
- The dataset records soil temperature and WFPS for ten plots at a consistent 2.5 cm depth, enabling analyses of temporal and block-based variations in soil moisture and temperature.

## Usage notes
- Used to analyze correlations and potential predictive relationships between soil temperature and WFPS across time, blocks, and plots.
- Part of a larger set of data series, with this file’s structure and variables explicitly defined for clear integration with supporting documentation.
