# Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy Supporting documentation for data

- Aim and scope
  - CINAg project to meet needs in China and the UK for optimizing farm practices and soil management to use nitrogen sources more effectively and reduce environmental Nr losses.
  - Objectives include developing novel indicators of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and holistic soil health metrics, testing on-field practices, and translating developments to Chinese farmers via the Science and Technology Backyard programme.
  - Structure across four Work Packages: WP1 (N cycling fundamentals), WP2 (novel N technologies), WP3 (improved agronomic practices), WP4 (predictive capacity and knowledge exchange).

- Experimental platforms and sites
  - Four UK farm platforms for cross-site experiments: North Wyke (NW), Harpenden (HA), Henfaes Farm (HF), Easter Bush (EB).
  - 2016: Inorganic fertilizer experiments on grassland at NW, HF, EB (three-cut silage system; total N ~240 kg N/ha).
  - 2017: Digestate experiments on winter wheat at NW and HF; additional grass trials at EB and HA.
  - 2018: UK-wide soil sampling across nine sites with multiple land-use types to assess aboveground biomass production and soil indicators.
  - Locations include North Wyke (Devon), Harpenden (Herefordshire), Henfaes (North Wales), Easter Bush (Scotland), plus nine Scotland/Wales/England sites for 2018 sampling.

- Data types and indicators
  - Plant and yield indicators
    - Yields (dry matter, grass quality metrics), herbage quality (CP, ME, NDF, ADF, etc.), N content and N offtake, nitrogen use efficiency (NUEc, NUEg).
  - Greenhouse gas measurements
    - Ammonia (NH3) emissions and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, with both manual and automatic chamber methods and wind-tunnel systems.
  - Soil metrics (WP1 and WP2)
    - Nitrogen species: NH4+, NO3-, amino acids and peptides, mineralisable N.
    - Organic/NOC pools: DOC, TDN, DON; soil microbial biomass C and N (MBC/MBN).
    - Soil structure and chemistry: aggregate size distribution, texture (sand/silt/clay), soil moisture, SOM, pH, EC, base cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg), total C and N, total P, POXC.
    - Phosphorus pools: citric acid extractable P, acetic acid extractable P, Olsen-P.
  - Molecular and microbial indicators
    - DNA/mRNA targets: nitrogen-cycle genes (nifH, amoA AOA/AOB, nirK, nirS, nosZ I/II, ureC) and total bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNA and fungal ITS (via qPCR and amplicon sequencing).
    - Microbial diversity indices (Shannon, richness) and OTU-level analyses.
  - Hydrology and soil physics
    - Soil water infiltration, soil water release curves ( HYPRO-FIT, Mualem-Durner models).
  - Aboveground biomass and land-use inventories
    - Biomass from grazing exclusion cages; site-specific measurements of pasture/land-use productivity.

- Protocols and data processing
  - Separate measurement protocols for WP1 (baseline and soil nutrient metrics) and WP2 (treatment responses, e.g., fertiliser and digestate applications).
  - Sampling schedules: multiple timepoints across treatments, crops, and sites; harvests aligned with peak biomass.
  - Data processing and QA
    - Data compiled in Excel; most analyses conducted in R; Bayesian approaches used to estimate cumulative N2O fluxes; QC procedures include laboratory standards and replication.
  - Analytical methods
    - Standard soil chemical methods (e.g., Mulvaney for NH4+, Miranda for NO3-, Keeney for mineralisable N).
    - P and C analyses (molybdate blue for P, LOI for SOM, elemental/combustion analyses for C/N).
    - NIR for forage quality; GC/other instrumental analyses for gas and gas-peak analyses.
  - Metagenomics and qPCR
    - DNA extraction from soil; qPCR for nitrogen-cycle genes; amplicon sequencing for bacteria (16S) and fungi (ITS); data processed with standard pipelines and diversity analyses.

- Data governance, sharing and metadata
  - Outputs disseminated to stakeholders; underlying data intended to be shared publicly where possible; data governance processes implemented.
  - Acknowledged barriers to data sharing include metadata gaps, data provenance, and cross-institutional data standards; emphasis on improving metadata and data management at source.
  - Project web page and publications provide access points for datasets and results.

- Key challenges and considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - Data availability and quality gaps (especially metadata) and access barriers across organizations.
  - Interoperability across sites with different protocols and measurement systems.
  - Need for clear data governance, storage, sharing policies, and version-controlled metadata to enable reuse.
  - Communicating complex, multi-metric findings (NUE indicators, soil health metrics, GHG fluxes) in actionable policy terms.

- Outputs and publications
