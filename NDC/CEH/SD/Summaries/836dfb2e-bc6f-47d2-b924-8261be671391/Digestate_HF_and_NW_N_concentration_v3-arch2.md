# Digestate_HF_and_NW_N_concentration.csv

## Overview
- 7 columns and 90 rows of data from the digestate wheat trial (2017) conducted at Henfaes Research Center, Bangor University (HF) and North Wyke research station (NW), Rothamsted Research.
- Nitrogen (N) concentrations measured in wheat components: grain (HF includes chaff for HF only), chaff, and straw at harvest.
- Treatments include: no nitrogen control (C), digestate (D), acidified digestate (AD), digestate with nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) (DNI), acidified digestate with nitrification inhibitor (ADNI), and NH4NO3 mineral N at 75, 150, 225, and 300 kg N ha-1.

## Dataset structure
- Site: HF and NW.
- Plot: Plot number; all yield measurements are derived from these plots except plots 1, 19, 25, 31, and 47, which were used for monthly samplings for the 150 kg N ha-1 treatment.
- Block: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 (randomised block design).
- Treatment: C (zero N control), D (digestate), AD (acidified digestate), DNI (digestate with nitrification inhibitor DMPP), ADNI (acidified digestate with DMPP), N-75, N-150, N-225, N-300 (NH4NO3 at specified rates).
- Grain_concentration_g_N_kg: N concentration in grain of winter wheat at harvest (g N kg-1). Note: measured for HF; not measured for NW.
- Chaff_concentration_g_N_kg: N concentration in chaff at harvest (g N kg-1). Not measured for NW.
- Straw_concentration_g_N_kg: N concentration in straw at harvest (g N kg-1).
- NA = Not Assessed.

## Experimental context
- The dataset provides details for the 2017 digestate wheat trial conducted at two sites with differing plot configurations and harvest areas.
- It is a supplement to the supporting documentation for data series described in Supporting_documentation_CINAg_experiments_final_check_v2.1.pdf.

## Measurements and units
- Concentrations given as grams of N per kilogram of plant material (g N kg-1).
- Plot and block identifiers are integers; site labels are HF or NW.

## Plot and layout details
- HF (Henfaes): plots used for nitrogen addition rates have harvest areas of 1.2 m x 6.5 m; plots for C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI have harvest areas of 1.2 m x 14 m.
- NW (North Wyke): plots for nitrogen addition rates have harvest areas of 2 m x 4.5 m; plots for C, D, AD, DNI, ADNI have harvest areas of 2 m x 9 m.

## Data notes
- NA indicates Not Assessed.
