SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Aim and scope of the document
- Documents long-term monitoring at Sourhope Field Site to understand relationships between soil properties, vegetation, biodiversity, and policy-relevant environmental health measures.
- Supports manipulation and observational experiments to reveal how management and environmental factors affect ecological outcomes.
- Aims to inform policy reviews and future decision-making through robust environmental health indicators.

## Site context and experimental design (overview)
- Location: Sourhope Field Site, Sourhope Experimental Farm, Bowmont valley, near Kelso; altitude ~304–315 m; Euoceanic, humid climate.
- Landscape and soils: Predominantly grassland with moorland and conifer areas; soils derived from igneous rocks with brown forest soil subtypes; sites organized into blocks with controlled disturbance and management treatments.
- Long-term network role: Core site within the United Kingdom Environmental Change Network (ECN); linked to Micronet projects to study soil microbial-plant relationships and grassland dynamics.
- Experimental framework (illustrative of the site’s approach):
  - Multi-block layout (e.g., Blocks 4 and 5 described in detail) with main plots, subplots, and additional Ecotron/controlled-environment components.
  - Treatments applied per main plot (e.g., Control; Lime; Nitrogen; Lime + Nitrogen; Biocide; Fallow) with standardized disturbance regimes including grazing simulations and plot fencing.
  - Long-term data collection across vegetation, soil chemistry, and soil physical characteristics to monitor shifts over time.

## Data collection methods and governance
- Vegetation sampling:
  - Field surveys (establishment year and subsequent years) using plot-based schemes; presence/absence data with potential abundance inferences from targeted quadrats.
  - Data support species inventories, community analyses, and trend assessment; emphasis on repeatability and comparability over time.
- Soil sampling and analyses:
  - Profile descriptions and horizon sampling (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; and other horizon designations as per site-specific profiles).
  - 0–30 cm auger cores collected per plot to form representative samples; deeper horizons profiled in pathways for horizon description.
  - Chemical analyses include: %N, %C, C:N ratio, moisture loss, loss on ignition (LOI), extractable bases (Ca, Na, K, Mg), pH in water and CaCl2, and exchangeable cations.
  - pH generally acidic in surface horizons; LOI and moisture loss highest in surface horizons, declining with depth; Ca and Mg commonly dominant in near-surface horizons in several blocks.
- Data management:
  - Physical samples archived (e.g., at -80°C for long-term storage) with linkage to Appendix datasets and chemical profiles.
  - Metadata and block-level summaries provided to support interpretation and cross-block comparisons.
  - Use of standardized lab barcode identifiers (e.g., MLURI Barcodes) for traceability of samples and analyses.
  - Availability of Appendix datasets and tables for ongoing longitudinal analyses and site monitoring.
- Data quality and interpretation:
  - Acknowledge establishment-year sampling gaps (partial subplot sampling) and block-to-block heterogeneity.
  - Integration of vegetation data with soil chemical/physical data to monitor coupled soil-plant dynamics over time.

## ECN and Micronet context
- Sourhope serves as a central node in the ECN network, measuring soil, air, water quality, and biodiversity to identify environmental changes and causal drivers.
- The Micronet project (1998–2002) exploited Sourhope data to explore relationships between soil microbial communities and plant communities across grassland systems, linking soil processes with vegetation outcomes.

## BLOCK 4: soil and vegetation data (example) and interpretations
- Soil profile (Block 4) overview:
  - Horizon sequence includes LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Soils described as fibrous, moist, with varying structure from blocky to granular; presence of igneous stones (andesite) and extensive fibrous root networks.
  - Color and texture shift from very organic-rich surface horizons to sandy loam and loams with increasing depth; small yet present mottling and angular blocky structures.
- Soil analysis (Block 4):
  - Weight-based data collected for each horizon (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx).
  - Measured properties show:
    - %N ranges roughly from 0.12 to 2.14 across horizons; %C from about 1.0 to over 38 in some surface horizons.
    - C:N ratios typically in the mid-teens to low 20s in surface horizons, decreasing with depth.
    - Ca and Mg are present with notable values in surface horizons; Na shows limited presence; K and Mg vary by horizon and block.
    - %Moisture loss and LOI are highest at the surface and decrease with depth.
    - pH(H2O) generally acidic (roughly 4.5–5.0) with similar trends for pH(CaCl2).
- Auger samples (Block 4):
  - Short-term, horizon-specific measurements show consistent patterns with horizon depth: %N and %C vary little between A/B horizons vs. deeper layers; C:N ratios and exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, Na reflect horizon maturation and mineralization status.
  - pH values from auger samples indicate acidity consistent with surface horizons, rising slightly with depth.
- Vegetation survey (Block 4):
  - Plot-level counts and species totals recorded; data indicate diverse vegetation assemblages across subplots with community composition reflecting microtopography and substrate differences.
  - Presence/absence and species totals provide a basis for tracking vegetation shifts alongside soil changes over time.

## BLOCK 5: soil and vegetation data (example) and interpretations
- Soil profile (Block 5) overview:
  - Horizon sequence includes LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with depth intervals from 0 to 100 cm; presence of medium to fine subangular blocky structures; abundant igneous stones (andesite) throughout deeper horizons.
  - Soils show a progression from fibrous, organic-rich surface horizons to more mineral-dominated subsoil horizons with mottling and varying structure.
- Soil analysis (Block 5):
  - %N and %C values show elevation in surface horizons with decreasing values with depth; C:N ratios reflect organic matter content across horizons.
  - Ca and Mg are notable in surface horizons but show variability block-to-block, often with higher Ca in certain near-surface horizons; Na, K, and Mg content vary across horizons and blocks.
  - %Moisture loss and LOI are highest in surface horizons (Ah) and decline down the profile; pH in water remains acidic; CaCl2 pH values are consistently lower than pH(H2O).
  - Auger sample data (Block 5) show horizon-specific variations in %N, %C, C:N ratio, exchangeable Ca/Mg/K, moisture loss, LOI, and pH; illustrating pronounced microhabitat differences within Block 5.
- Auger samples (Block 5):
  - Detailed horizon-level measurements corroborate the general soil patterns observed in Block 5, with Ca, Mg, and other cations showing horizon- and plot-level variability.
- Vegetation survey (Block 5):
  - Plot-based vegetation data record species totals and presence across subplots; results reflect community structure tied to substrate diversity and soil chemistry, enabling tracking of vegetation dynamics in response to soil changes and management treatments.

##ECN ecosystem monitoring and data integration insights
- The Sourhope data exemplify how a monitoring framework can interlink:
  - A clearly defined site and experimental design (blocks, plots, subplots, and controlled treatments) with randomization and standardized disturbance regimes.
  - Repeatable data collection protocols for both vegetation and soil components to enable longitudinal analyses.
  - Integration with classification frameworks and cross-study comparability (as shown in broader summaries) to benchmark against other sites and studies.
  - Strong data governance: metadata-rich datasets, physical sample archiving, traceability via barcodes, and publication-ready datasets to support policy-relevant analyses.

## Key takeaways for monitoring framework design (principles illustrated by this document)
- Build a structured, multi-layered monitoring framework that couples vegetation and soil measurements over the long term.
- Maintain rigorous data governance: metadata completeness, standardized sampling protocols, archival of physical samples, and transparent data sharing to maximize policy relevance.
- Use block/plot designs with standardized treatments and disturbance regimes to enable robust treatment effects and temporal trend analyses.
- Align data with established classification and analytical frameworks to support cross-study benchmarking and policy-context interpretation.
- Acknowledge and document data gaps (e.g., establishment-year sampling limitations) and variability across blocks to ensure cautious interpretation and credible longitudinal analyses.
