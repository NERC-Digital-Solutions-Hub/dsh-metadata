# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide context for detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons; data presented to link with other groups’ data.
- Focus areas: Automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical (plant) composition via Point Quadrat surveys.
- Experimental design includes six treatments across plots: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Biocide.
- 2001 activities affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change in site management personnel; shift from manual mowing to mechanical cutting; one biocide application delayed.

## Data Collected and Methods
- Measurements taken across plots and blocks (5 blocks, multiple treatments) with standardized procedures as per Baseline Data Survey (1998).
- Above-ground biomass: five summer harvests per year (1999–2001), dried weights summed; data normalized to enable cross-year comparisons.
- Soil pH: measured in the upper 5 cm (distilled water method) at baseline (1998) and Oct 2001.
- Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys in July (2001) aligned with 2000 protocol; 100-cell grid with 25 “pin” touches per quadrat to record species hits.
- Weather station data: Headline measures including rainfall, radiation, and temperatures; 1999–2001 values recorded and compared.
- Species codes recorded (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris, Fr = Festuca rubra, N = Nitrogen, L = Lime, B = Biocide, etc.).
- Site heterogeneity: noted spatial variation across columns and site layout (e.g., columns E and F with different pH trends).

## Key Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 rainfall close to long-term average (839 mm); radiation ~3473–3473 MJ/m2; average temperatures around 7.28–7.66°C; soil moisture modestly higher than 2000.
- 1999–2000 conditions used as context; 2001 relatively drier and cooler than some prior years.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Clear hierarchy among treatments: improved plots (N and/or L) generally higher biomass than unimproved plots.
- Peak biomass consistently in July or August each year.
- 2001 biomass substantially higher than 2000, likely due to personnel changes and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- When normalised to a control (C1), nitrogen and/or lime showed positive impacts on productivity.
- Analysis: significant differences between improved vs non-improved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition raised soil pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots ~6.19; Nitrogen & Lime plots ~6.38.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed little to no change from baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- 2001 Point Quadrat survey: no significant surveyor effect; total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting increased sward density (potentially from past grazing removal in 1998).
- Species shifts across treatments:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; remained most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen (F. ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (F. rubra) plots.
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) more apparent in fertilised plots (especially N & L).
  - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots (Control and Biocide).
- Species richness: unimproved plots contained 24 species; improved N & L plots contained 18 species, suggesting potential decline in diversity with improvements.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed:
  - Clear separation of nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Biomass increases tied to shifts toward Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, and related species; reduced presence of bryophytes and certain grasses as biomass rose.
- Biomass vs species composition: increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; decline of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophyte group with higher biomass plots.
- Litter turnover increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F exhibited comparatively more acidic plots.
- This spatial pattern linked to underlying differences in pH within N and/or Lime plots in these columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass values exhibited outliers (low biomass in specific plots) but generally:
  - Higher biomass in centrally located plots (e.g., N&L plots in 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B).
- Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences among blocks.

## Implications for GIS and Spatial Analysis
- The dataset highlights pronounced spatial heterogeneity across the field site, with pH, biomass, and species composition varying by plot and column.
- Useful GIS applications:
  - Mapping pH gradients and their relation to biomass and species distribution.
  - Multivariate analysis (e.g., PCA) to classify plots by treatment and community composition.
  - Linking weather data to spatial biomass and pH patterns to assess environmental drivers.
- Data supports cross-year comparisons for monitoring how management treatments influence spatial patterns of productivity and biodiversity.

## Notable Contextual Details
- Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions in 2001 limited visits Feb–May; subsequent adherence to vet protocol.
- Change in site management personnel (Officer in Charge) during 2001.
- 2001 sampling adjustments included shift to mechanical mowing; one biocide application was missed in May but subsequent applications proceeded.

## Summary of Main Findings
- Nitrogen and/or Lime treatments consistently increase above-ground biomass and raise soil pH compared with controls.
- 2001 showed elevated biomass relative to 2000, likely due to operational changes rather than treatment alone.
- Plant community composition shifts toward species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) as fertility increases; overall species richness declines modestly in improved plots.
- Spatial heterogeneity is evident, with pH and biomass varying across site columns and central plots tending to harbor higher biomass.
- The data provide a robust basis for spatial analysis of how soil chemistry and management influence biomass production and plant community structure in a GIS context.
