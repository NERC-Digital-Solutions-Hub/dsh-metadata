# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Overview
  - Documentation of the Sourhope field site within the Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Programme.
  - Describes site setting, soils, vegetation, land use, facilities, experimental design, and data collection methods for soil-vegetation studies.
  - Emphasizes long-term, GIS-friendly data for map-based visualization and analysis.

- Spatial framework and GIS-ready data model
  - Five blocks (Block 1–5) forming a geo-referenced grid: five-block structure supports block-by-block and cross-block spatial analyses.
  - Each block contains multiple main plots (approx. 30 total per site) and subplots (15 per main plot), enabling fine-grained spatial mapping of treatments and vegetation/soil variation.
  - An Ecotron sub-area and an ECN SERAD network role provide additional controlled-environment and inter-site comparability data.
  - Data organization supports map layers for:
    - Block, plot, and subplot boundaries with grid references and site attributes (altitude, slope, drainage, soil series).
    - Vegetation communities and species presence/absence/abundance indicators.
    - Soil properties by horizon (depth intervals such as FH/Ah AB Bg BCg Cg, and deeper horizons) and per plot.
    - Temporal context with year-specific surveys (began 1998; July–August 1998 for vegetation, August 1998 for soils).

- Site setting and temporal coverage
  - Sourhope Experimental Farm, Sourhope/Rigg Foot site; mid-altitude upland grassland.
  - Environment captured through long-term data streams (ECN and SERAD networks).
  - Primary vegetation and soil data collected since 1998, enabling trend and spatial analyses across years and treatments.

- Experimental design and treatments (high-level)
  - Soil–vegetation experiments established to perturb systems with nutrient, liming, biocide, and control treatments.
  - Randomized assignment within blocks; designed to study plant and soil responses to nutrient regimes and management contrasts.
  - Distinct Ecotron and field plots support both in-situ and controlled-environment investigations.

- Data types and collection methods
  - Vegetation data
    - Surveys use 50 x 50 cm quadrats within randomly selected subplots; 25 points per quadrat recorded for presence/absence and inferred abundance.
    - Outputs include species lists, community classifications (e.g., NVC-type associations), and indicator species for discriminating communities.
    - Year 1998 baseline survey with extensive species inventory across blocks.
  - Soil data
    - Soil sampling: 30 cores per plot (0–30 cm), plus horizon-based pit descriptions along transects; samples archived (-80°C) for future analyses.
    - Analyses include gravimetric moisture, pH (H2O and CaCl2), %N, %C, C:N, extractable Ca/Na/K/Mg, %Moisture Loss, %LOI, and horizon-specific metrics.
    - Soil profiles described by horizon (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with depth ranges and textural/structure notes.
  - ECOTRON data
    - ECOTRON soil analyses and vegetation surveys accompany the main site data to support controlled-environment comparisons.
    - Includes specific measurements such as pH, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, moisture loss, LOI, and horizon-level details for ECOTRON plots.

- Block- and plot-level data highlights (examples from Blocks 4 and 5)
  - Block 4: Detailed auger-sample chemistry across subplots (4A–4F) with measured %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH, etc., plus vegetation survey totals per subplot.
  - Block 5: Site details (grid reference NT8544019520; altitude 315 m; slope 5 degrees; imperfect drainage; Brown forest soil with gleying). Depth-specific soil profiles (0–100 cm) across horizons (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with comprehensive soil chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg) and pH by horizon; accompanying auger sample analyses and vegetation survey data (plot-level species counts and presence/absence across subplots).
  - ECOTRON PLOT: Soil analysis and vegetation survey data for an ecotron subplot within the ECOTRON site, with horizon-specific soil chemistry and vegetation indicators.

- Data presentation, documentation, and accessibility for GIS
  - Extensive, geo-referenced data tables accompany narrative sections:
    - Species lists, plot-by-plot vegetation presence/absence, and community assignments.
    - Soil chemical values by block and horizon, plus site-wide summaries and horizon-specific notes.
    - Appendix data detailing block-by-block soil and vegetation characteristics (grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, and soil profiles).
  - Appendices designed to support GIS mapping and spatial analyses of:
    - Treatment effects on vegetation composition and soil properties.
    - Spatial gradients of soil nutrients, pH, and organic matter across blocks and plots.
    - Interactions between soil properties and vegetation across horizons and blocks.

- Practical GIS and data-product implications
  - The program provides a structured, geo-referenced framework suited for map-based data products:
    - Layered visualization of treatments, vegetation communities, and soil gradients at block, plot, and subplot scales.
    - Spatial modeling of biodiversity and soil–plant interactions across a mid-altitude upland grassland.
    - Cross-site comparability and long-term trend analysis via ECN/SERAD-network data.
  - Rich multi-layer datasets enable GIS-ready analyses of spatial relationships, temporal changes, and habitat associations within a consistent, well-documented data architecture.

- Access, context, and broader significance
  - Sourhope serves as a cornerstone site within ECN and SERAD networks, enabling long-term environmental monitoring and cross-site comparisons in grassland ecology, soil microbial–plant relationships, and sustainability research.
  - The data design supports integration with map-based data products, enabling policy-relevant visualization and communication for diverse audiences.
