# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG FOOT, SOURHOPE

- A multi-block soil and vegetation data record from Rigg Foot, Sourhope, detailing soil profiles, chemical analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys.
- Focuses on BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5, plus an ECOTRON PLOT describing soil chemistry and plant communities within an experimental setup.
- Data are organized by horizons, sample identifiers (MLURI barcodes), and plot/subplot design, enabling cross-block comparisons and linking soil chemistry to vegetation.

## BLOCK 4

- Soil profile overview
  - Defined horizons: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Descriptive characteristics across horizons: fibrous, moist, minimal mineral grains in surface horizons; Ah horizon rich in organic matter with sandy silt loam texture; presence of igneous stones (andesite) and distinct boundary transitions; subdued structure in deeper horizons.
  - Notable features: high organic content and moisture in upper horizons; mineral grains appear more identifiable at deeper horizons; stones common from Ah downward.
- Block 4 soil analysis (PROFILE)
  - Key metrics (per horizon): %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Surface horizons show high %C and %N relative to deeper horizons; LOI values are very high in FH and H (e.g., LOI >60% in FH, ~63–64% in H) and decline in Ah and deeper horizons.
  - pH values: generally acidic (pH(H2O) ~4.7–5.0; pH(CaCl2) ~3.8–4.2) across horizons; Ca, Mg, K, and Na show elevated values in the upper horizons and different distributions in deeper horizons.
  - Notable horizon patterns: Ah shows substantial carbon and nitrogen; deeper horizons (Abg, B sg, C gx) show lower N, C, and different cation patterns; Ca and Mg contents vary by horizon with Ca highest near surface layers in some profiles.
- Block 4 AUGER SAMPLES
  - Samples 4A–4F analyzed for weights and chemical properties (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2)).
  - General trend: consistent N and C values across auger samples with relatively high C in some upper auger depths; C:N ratios spanning roughly 12–14 in many samples; pH values typically around 3.8–4.7 CaCl2, slightly higher in H2O readings.
- Block 4 VEGETATION SURVEY
  - Plot 4A and 4B show species presence totals and counts across subplots; data indicate species totals and indicator species across different microhabitats within the block.
  - Observations suggest vegetation composition correlates with soil horizon properties and microtopography, with variation across plots (e.g., dense mosses/bryophytes and grasses in some plots; lower coverage in others).
- Data interpretation notes
  - Clearly delineated horizon boundaries and detailed soil description accompany chemistry data, enabling soil-plant interaction analyses.
  - Some horizons exhibit very high LOI and carbon contents in the upper layers, consistent with organic-rich surface soils and potential peat-like characteristics.
  - Data are sample- and plot-specific, permitting block-level comparisons of soil chemistry, while acknowledging horizon-level variability and potential measurement noise in patches.

## BLOCK 5

- Site details
  - Block 5 site: grid reference NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5 degrees; imperfect drainage; major soil subgroup described as Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material includes undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
- BLOCK 5 SOIL PROFILE
  - Horizons: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Descriptive features: surface horizons with fibrous roots; Ah horizon rich in organic matter (sandy silt loam to texture variations); AB and Bg horizons showing mottling and prominent changes in texture and structure; BCg and Cg horizons with clay loam textures and massive to blocky structures.
  - Distinctive horizon properties: Ah and AB horizons show strong organic matter and root abundance; BCg shows pronounced mottling and higher clay; Cg displays strong horizon development with reduced root presence.
- BLOCK 5 PROFILE CHEMISTRY (PROFILE)
  - %N and %C values across horizons show high carbon in surface horizons (Ah and AB) with substantial LOI (typical values in Ah/AB around high LOI; surface horizons often >60–70% LOI). Deeper horizons exhibit lower %N and %C but retain notable total carbon in some layers.
  - C:N ratios span roughly 10–14 in several horizons, with Ah/AB showing higher carbon content and relatively low nitrogen in deeper horizons.
  - Ca, Mg, K, Na, and overall exchangeable cations vary by horizon; surface horizons commonly show elevated Ca and Mg, with decreasing trends in deeper horizons.
  - pH values: generally acidic to slightly acidic (pH(H2O) around 4.4–5.2; pH(CaCl2) typically 3.6–4.2 depending on horizon and sub-sample).
  - %Moisture loss and %LOI: high organic-rich surface horizons with elevated LOI (~60–70% range in Ah/AB), decreasing with depth.
- BLOCK 5 AUGER SAMPLES
  - Samples 5A–5F analyzed for Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Observed patterns mirror profile data: higher %C and LOI in upper horizons; C:N ratios around 12–14; Ca and other cations vary with horizon, often higher in surface horizons; pH values reflect acidic to slightly acidic conditions across horizons.
- BLOCK 5 VEGETATION SURVEY
  - Plot-level vegetation data illustrate species totals and occurrence across subplots and horizons, showing spatial variability in plant communities aligned with soil gradient and horizon depth.
- Data interpretation notes
  - Block 5 presents a deeper, more textured profile with pronounced horizon development and strong organic-rich surface horizons (Ah/AB) transitioning to Bg/BCg and Cg horizons.
  - The combination of profile description, auger data, and vegetation surveys enables exploration of soil-plant interactions under differing horizon-forming processes, mineralogy, and drainage conditions.
  - As with Block 4, there are horizon-specific sensitivities (organic content, mottling, texture changes) that influence soil chemistry and plant communities.

- Data types included: horizon descriptions, soil chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg), moisture metrics (moisture loss, LOI), pH readings (H2O and CaCl2), bulk density/weight measurements, and vegetation presence/absence with plot-level totals.
- Organization: data organized by block, horizon, and sample type (profile vs auger) with accompanying vegetation survey outputs per plot/subplot.
- Purpose and use: designed to enable cross-block comparisons, soil-vegetation interaction analyses, and integration with long-term monitoring frameworks for soil processes, landscape development, and management impacts.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR DATA USE AND INTEGRATION

- Rich, horizon-resolved dataset linking soil chemistry and structure to vegetation across multiple blocks (4 and 5) and an ECOTRON experiment.
- Upper horizons consistently show high organic matter and LOI, with corresponding soil chemistry patterns (N, C, Ca, Mg, pH) that influence plant communities.
- Deeper horizons reveal evolving textures and mottling, with distinct changes in cation distribution and pH, suitable for studying pedogenesis under varying drainage and parent material conditions.
- Data products you can create or enhance:
  - Block- and horizon-level dashboards comparing C, N, LOI, Ca/Mg/K, and pH across treatments and depths.
  - Linkage analyses between soil gradients and vegetation classifications/indicator species (e.g., twins of indicator taxa and horizon chemistry).
  - Time-series extension by integrating ECOTRON with field plots for long-term soil-plant dynamics under different management regimes.
  - Archival reuse: leverage MLURI barcodes for targeted re-analysis or future molecular/microbiome investigations aligned with soil carbon and nutrient profiles.
- Considerations and caveats:
  - High variability across horizons and blocks; interpret block-level patterns with attention to horizon depth, texture, and drainage differences.
  - Presence of stones and mottling in deeper horizons may affect sampling representativeness; cross-check with horizon descriptions and LOI data.
  - Vegetation data are presence/absence based with potential abundance inferences limited by sampling design; use with horizon- and class-based analyses for robustness.
