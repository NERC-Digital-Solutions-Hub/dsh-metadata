# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, the site has been monitored to understand how aboveground biomass (productivity), species composition, and diversity respond to mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide treatments.
- The project involves a large, multi-project framework (Phase I and II) with extensive data collection and site management records, coupled with botanical, soil, and microfaunal observations.
- Data are used to assess functional changes in plant communities and their links to soil conditions, climate, and management practices, with results informing data governance and sharing practices for long-term biodiversity datasets.

## Overview of the Programme and Site Management

- Location and purpose:
  - Sourhope field site in the Scottish Borders; aims to link soil biodiversity with aboveground plant responses under controlled management.
- Management regimes and treatments:
  - Mowing: monthly cuts to about 6 cm, beginning in 1999.
  - Insecticide: Dursban 4 (chlorpyrifos) applied to insecticide plots after mowing.
  - Fertilisation: nitrogen and/or lime added to designated plots.
  - Five plot-level treatments (Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime) plus Insecticide plots.
- Experimental design:
  - Rigg Foot site with 5 replicate blocks on downslope gradient; plots subdivided into sub-plots with 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells.
- Data availability and documentation:
  - Full project details available via the Soil Biodiversity website and CEH contacts.
- Context and constraints:
  - 2001: restrictions on site visits due to foot-and-mouth disease; resumed in 2002 with field activity continuing.
  - Large, multi-project data environment requiring consistent metadata and cross-project data governance.

## Data Collected and Datasets

- Data types and measurements:
  - Above-ground biomass (productivity): annual and monthly biomass from 0.5 m^2 sampling cells, dried and weighed.
  - Vegetation surveys: baseline (1998) using 0.5 m^2 quadrats; annual point analyses in 2000–2002 using 100-point grids within each sampling cell; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
  - Species composition and diversity: Recorded vascular plants and bryophytes; CSR-based functional classifications tracked over time.
  - Soil measurements: soil pH (centered on plots and within sampling cells), soil moisture (theta probe in 2002), and general soil data.
  - Weather data: on-site Automatic Weather Station since February 1999 (temperature, rainfall, radiation, moisture).
  - Appendix datasets: extensive datasets include species lists, biomass per plot, rank analyses, bryophyte diversity, and survey metadata.
- Data volumes and scope:
  - 16 Phase I and II projects contributing field data.
  - 11,621 soil samples collected since project start.
  - Biomass, point analyses, and related measurements accumulated across multiple years (1999–2002).
- Data structure and accessibility:
  - Data organized by site, plot, and sub-plot with clear treatment allocations (Appendix 2).
  - Appendices provide species lists (Appendix 3), weather data (Appendix 5), biomass and rank data (Appendices 6–7), and bryophyte analyses (Appendix 8).

## Data Collection Practices and Data Management

- Data collection cadence and methods:
  - Vegetation clipping and biomass measurements after each mowing event (May–Sept) across five cuts per summer.
  - Point analysis surveys conducted annually (2000–2002) with a standardized 100-hole grid per 0.5 m^2 cell.
  - Baseline botanical survey in 1998; 2000–2002 follow-up analyses for community structure.
  - Soil sampling and pH monitoring since 1998; 2002 moisture measurements across sampling cells.
- Documentation and governance:
  - Detailed Appendix 2 documents site/activity and treatment schedules; Appendix 3 lists species observed; Appendix 5 summarizes weather data collection; Appendix 6–8 present biomass and species-abundance data.
- Data quality and QA considerations:
  - Standardised drying (80°C) and weighing for biomass.
  - Taxonomic updates in 2002 (bryophytes identified to species) to improve data accuracy.
  - Note on data gaps and substitutions due to an on-site weather-station malfunction in 2002; missing periods were substituted with data from a nearby Konza weather station.

## Data Quality, Provenance, and Analytical Insights

- Key observations on data quality and patterns:
  - Biomass productivity follows a clear treatment hierarchy, with highest productivity in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime, and lower productivity in unfertilised plots.
  - In 2002, across several plots, mid-summer biomass declined relative to 2001, with block location on the slope affecting productivity.
  - Soil pH increased significantly in limed plots (approaching pH 7.0); nitrogen alone raised pH modestly; control and insecticide plots remained near baseline.
  - A strong relationship exists between higher soil pH and productivity overall, though treatment-specific relationships vary (positive across all plots, but nuanced within individual treatments).
  - Point analyses show shifts in plant functional groups: nitrogen+lime plots dominated by competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) group; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerant (S) species; declines in SR/CSR groups with changes in disturbance regime.
  - Bryophyte abundance increased across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; mosses contributed substantially to total hits by 2002.
- Analytical outcomes:
  - Statistical evidence from ANOVA shows significant treatment effects on biomass and significant year-by-treatment interactions.
  - PCA of 2002 point-analysis data separated improved vs unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots clustering distinctly; nitrogen-treated samples showed mixed associations by block.
  - Shannon diversity indices show year-on-year treatment differences, with notable declines in nitrogen+lime plots relative to other treatments by 2002.
- Data interpretation and caveats:
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are discussed but causality is not conclusively established due to limited mechanistic data.
  - The trampling/impact in C2 plots during 13CO2 pulse activities is noted as a potential contributor to reduced productivity in 2002 for those plots.

## Data Governance, Access, and Documentation Implications

- Access and discoverability:
  - Comprehensive reporting and appendices support data reuse; primary data and analyses are referenced via the Soil Biodiversity website and project PI communications.
- Documentation and metadata:
  - Clear documentation of site layout, treatments, sampling regimes, and data products (Appendices 1–8) to support reproducibility and cross-project integration.
  - Metadata covers sampling dates, plot-level treatments, sampling cell locations, and measurement protocols (e.g., drying temperatures, biomass calculations).
- Data stewardship learnings and recommendations:
  - The programme demonstrates the value of long-term, multi-project biodiversity data with standardized metadata and cross-year comparability.
  - Given scale and heterogeneity (multiple treatments, years, and data types), robust metadata standards, data dictionaries, and versioning are essential for ongoing stewardship and discoverability.
  - Documenting treatment changes (e.g., re-referencing Biocide to Insecticide) and ongoing data provenance is critical for cross-study integration.

## Practical Implications and Next Steps for Data Stewards

- Maintain and expand metadata:
  - Ensure complete, machine-readable metadata for all data types (biomass, plant surveys, soil chemistry, bryophytes, weather) with clear unit definitions and sampling timelines.
- Ensure data quality and interoperability:
  - Continue standardized data processing workflows (e.g., biomass calculation, CSR classification) and maintain a data dictionary aligned with CSR and functional-group concepts.
- Archive and share data:
  - Preserve long-term datasets with versioning; provide programmatic access to Appendices and key datasets; maintain links to the Soil Biodiversity website for ongoing data discovery.
- Address data gaps and outages:
  - Capture and document any data gaps (e.g., 2002 weather-station outage) and establish policy for data substitution or imputation with proper provenance notes.
- Support cross-project collaboration:
  - Maintain clear mapping of treatments and plots across Phase I and Phase II projects to enable integrated analyses and cross-study reuse.
