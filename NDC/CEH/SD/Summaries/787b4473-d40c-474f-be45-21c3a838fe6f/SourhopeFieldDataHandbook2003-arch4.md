# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

## Overview
- A detailed dataset describing soil profiles, chemistry, auger samples, and vegetation surveys at Sourhope (Blocks 4 and 5) and Ecotron plots.
- Integrates soil, vegetation, and site metadata for long-term ecological monitoring and cross-network collaboration (ECN, Micronet).

## Data scope and assets
- Soil profiles
  - Block 4: Horizons LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Block 5: Horizons LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Descriptions include color, texture (fibrous, sandy silt loam, clay loam, etc.), structure, moisture, roots, and stone content.
- Soil analyses (per horizon)
  - MLURI barcode identifiers; measured values for: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
- Auger samples
  - Block 4 and Block 5 augers (A–F) with Wt (mg) and soil chemistries (%N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg), %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH, etc.
- Vegetation surveys
  - Plot-level totals by subplot across blocks (4A–4F, 5A–5F) including species presence/absence counts and totals.
- Ecotron plots
  - Separate soil analysis and vegetation survey data for Ecotron plots.
- Metadata and provenance
  - Grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material, rock type; barcodes; depths; sampling protocols.
- Data management
  - Data stored via MLURI/ECN networks; archival samples at CEH Merlewood (−80°C).

## Site details and sampling design
- Rigg Foot site characteristics
  - Includes Block 4 and Block 5 on a north-facing slope with defined main plots and subplots; Ecotron plots used for additional experiments.
  - Major soil subgroups described as Brown forest soils with gleying; igneous/andesitic parent material.
- Sampling framework
  - Structured blocks with horizon-focused sampling (0–100 cm range in main profiles); auger sampling in W-pattern; vegetation surveys per subplot.

## Data collection methods
- Soil profile description
  - Hierarchical horizons with color, structure, moisture, root density, presence of stones, boundary type.
- Laboratory analyses
  - Measured properties include %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
- Auger sampling
  - Depth-specific sampling; multiple horizon values per sample; consistency with horizon descriptors.
- Vegetation sampling
  - Presence/absence and counts of species per subplot; data used for community classification and association analyses.
- Data provenance
  - Horizon depths, barcodes, sample handling and depths are documented for traceability.

## Data processing and analysis
- Vegetation data
  - Twinspan groupings to identify frequent co-occurring species; National Vegetation Classification (NVC) alignment (e.g., U4d and U5b variants); indicator species by block/subplot.
- Soil data
  - Descriptive statistics by horizon and block; correlations (e.g., %N vs %C, C:N vs moisture loss, Ca vs pH); and multivariate analyses (PCA) showing major variation driven by %N, %C, C:N, Ca, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI; pH variables contribute separately.
- Data quality considerations
  - Notes on partial subplot sampling and potential block effects; anomalies in some blocks/horizons requiring cautious interpretation.

## Data quality, limitations, and metadata
- Limitations
  - Subset sampling (not full site coverage) affects representativeness; grazing management differences in establishment year may influence results.
  - Some horizons show anomalous chemical values or pH readings.
- Metadata richness
  - Detailed horizon descriptions, depths, chemical data, and sample IDs; appendices with block-specific soil and vegetation data.
- Long-term data stewardship
  - Archival of physical samples and long-term digital storage; data linked to MLURI and ECN networks.

## Data management and access
- Storage and archiving
  - Samples stored at CEH Merlewood (−80°C); data accessible via MLURI computing resources and ECN network.
- Provenance and documentation
  - Comprehensive metadata including grid references, elevation, slope, drainage, soil series, horizons, barcodes, and depth intervals; organized by blocks and plots.
- Network and collaboration
  - Data contribute to Sourhope’s role within ECN and Micronet; supports cross-network environmental monitoring and research.

## Implications for Data Leaders (data strategy perspective)
- System-wide data thinking
  - Demonstrates a cohesive data system integrating climate, soil, vegetation, and management data across multiple blocks and plots.
- Discoverability and metadata
  - Emphasizes consistent metadata standards (horizon naming, plot IDs, block codes, barcodes, sampling protocols) to enable cross-site discovery and reuse.
- User needs and co-ownership
  - Data products (Twinspan outputs, NVC classifications, association analyses) serve researchers and policy colleagues; long-term datasets enable cross-network learning.
- Data quality, standards, interoperability
  - Highlights need for standardized sampling, complete plot coverage, and transparent reporting of anomalies; address block-level variability for comparability.
- Governance and stewardship
  - Underlines secure storage, archiving of physical samples, and reproducible analyses; fosters cross-network data sharing for policy and science impact.
- Practical actions for data leaders
  - Invest in unified data schemas and documentation to improve discoverability and reuse.
  - Establish governance for long-term storage and archival of physical samples and for reproducible analyses.
  - Promote cross-network collaboration to maximise data utility and impact.

## Appendices and documentation
- Appendices with block-level soil and vegetation data; detailed soil profiles, horizons, sample metadata; tables and figures detailing species, soil chemistry, and vegetation classifications.

Note: The document provides a comprehensive, multi-faceted dataset for studying soil biodiversity at Sourhope, including long-term data collection, robust soil and vegetation analyses, and integration with national/international environmental monitoring networks.
