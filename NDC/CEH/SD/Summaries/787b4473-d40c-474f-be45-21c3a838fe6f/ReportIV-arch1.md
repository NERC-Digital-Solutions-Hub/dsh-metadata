Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report 2002

## Overview
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on above-ground biomass (productivity), plant community composition, and diversity.
- The site is a fenced, non-grazed field with five replicate blocks, five main plots per block, and 0.5 m2 sub-plots allocated to different research groups.
- Five main plot-level treatments (plus a separate insecticide treatment) include controls, nitrogen, lime, nitrogen plus lime, and an insecticide treatment; mowing is performed monthly May–September to ~6 cm height.

## Treatments and Data Collection
- Management actions enacted annually since 1999:
  - Mowing: ~6 cm height, monthly during growing season.
  - Insecticide: Dursban 4 (chlorpyrifos) applied after mowing on insecticide plots.
  - Fertility: Nitrogen and/or lime applied in spring (rates detailed in appendices).
- Data collected since 1998-1999:
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station.
  - Above-ground productivity: regular 0.5 m2 biomass samples per plot.
  - Baseline and subsequent botanical surveys using 0.5 m2 point analyses (2000, 2001, 2002), bryophyte identification enhanced in 2002.
  - Soil pH (up to 5–10 cm) and soil moisture measurements.
  - Additional small-scale botanical surveys and biomass subsets for various projects.

## Key Findings: Biomass and Productivity
- 2002 biomass generally lower than 2001 but higher than 1999 baseline; overall upward long-term trend across treatments.
- Fertilised plots show the strongest productivity gains; the combination of nitrogen and lime yields the highest biomass.
- Control 2 plots show the lowest productivity in 2002; slope position affects productivity (down-slope vs up-slope differences).
- Annual ANOVA indicates significant treatment effects and year-by-treatment interactions, with nitrogen and lime together providing the greatest biomass response.

## Soil–Plant Interactions
- Soil pH: Lime markedly increases soil pH toward ~7 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen raises pH modestly; controls and insecticide plots remain near baseline pH.
- Soil moisture: Negative correlation with pH; higher pH plots tend to be drier.
- Biomass–pH relationship: Positive overall when pooling treatments; within some treatments (especially those with nitrogen or lime alone) this relationship weakens; with both nitrogen and lime, the relationship may become negative, suggesting a more complex, non-linear response at high pH and altered moisture regimes.

## Plant Community Composition and Diversity
- Point analysis (2002) shows:
  - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) dominated by Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots remain dominated by Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.
  - Bryophytes, led by Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, increase across the site, reaching ~20% of total hits in 2002; mosses more prominent in unimproved plots.
- Functional groups (CSR framework):
  - Three main groups: stress tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and SR/CSR combinations.
  - In 2000–2002, treatment differences emerged in SR/CSR and CSR categories.
  - Nitrogen and Lime plots: dominant CS-R (competitive-stress) species become prevalent, aided by higher soil pH and growth rates.
  - Unimproved plots favor stress-tolerant species; SR/CSR species reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
  - Across 2000–2002, CSR/S-R patterns shift with management, indicating functional shifts in plant communities in response to nutrient status and disturbance regime.
- Diversity (Shannon index):
  - Baseline: no differences; beginning 2000–2002 differences appear.
  - 2002: the Shannon index declined in nitrogen-and-lime plots relative to other treatments, which showed increases (notably 29% in some insecticide plots), indicating reduced diversity where nutrient and lime supplementation were combined.

## Insecticide and Trampling Effects
- Insecticide effect: Increases in diversity indicated in some analyses, but the causal link to reduced herbivory is not definitively established; observed patterns are consistent with possible herbivore-mediated release of certain plant species under low-nutrient conditions.
- Trampling effect: In 2002, C2 plots (which experienced intense activity related to labelled 13CO2 pulses) showed marked reductions in productivity, attributed to trampling during high-activity periods.

## Additional Observations and Context
- Moss expansion and bryophyte increases are linked to the regular mowing regime and the absence of grazing, potentially contributing to reduced vascular plant diversity in some plots.
- The lag between soil changes (pH, nutrients) and vegetation responses means long-term monitoring is needed to determine if trends stabilize or reverse with continued management.
- The discussion emphasizes three primary drivers of vegetation change (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) and a trampling-related caveat, with a cautionary stance on inferring direct causal links where evidence remains circumstantial.

## Conclusions and Implications
- Management decisions strongly shape plant functional groups, biomass productivity, and diversity:
  - Fertilisation (especially N+L) increases productivity but may reduce diversity over time and drive CSR-dominated communities.
  - Regular mowing promotes Festuca rubra and bryophyte expansion, potentially at the expense of Agrostis spp. and some disturbance-sensitive species.
  - Insecticide use shows potential diversity benefits, though direct causal mechanisms require further confirmation.
- The observed shifts toward stress-tolerant and competitive-stress-ruderal groups in fertilised plots suggest longer-term changes in community structure under elevated soil pH and differential moisture regimes.
- Trampling during experimental manipulations can confound productivity measurements, underscoring the need to separate treatment effects from disturbance-related artefacts in interpretation.
