# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and monitoring framework
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on an intensive field experiment at Sourhope, with a baseline data survey in 1998.
  - A broad, standardized monitoring plan accompanied more detailed group studies; measurements were designed to enable year-to-year comparisons and links with other data.
  - Data collection followed explicit tables and protocols (e.g., mowing schedules, 0.5 m2 quadrats, 25-point hits, full botanical surveys) and were stored/uploaded via appropriate data portals.
  - 2001 field management was affected by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions and a change of the site officer, but core activities (liming, N, pH measurements, biomass, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued per the Site Management Plan.

- 2. Results
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather broadly unremarkable: rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to prior years; slight cooling in mean temperatures; soil moisture modestly higher than earlier years.
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Consistent treatment hierarchy in biomass across years; peak biomass in July/Aug.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 1999–2000, likely influenced by changes in personnel and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
    - Normalising by C1 showed nitrogen and lime (N, L, and N+L) generally increased biomass; N+L and N alone had strong effects; statistical analyses indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) versus unimproved plots and a significant inter-year treatment effect, with no significant block effect.
  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Liming continued to raise surface pH; October 2001 pH averaged 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in N+L plots.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent; control plots remained near baseline values.
  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Analysis captured 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) vs 18 in N+L plots, suggesting reduced diversity with greater fertility.
    - Notable shifts in species abundance across treatments:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
      - Festuca spp (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments; Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra became more common in fertilised plots (especially N+L).
      - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) increased with fertility; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
    - Biodiversity and evenness trends: greater species richness in unimproved plots; reduced richness in N+L plots (24 vs 18 species).
    - Multivariate analysis (PCA) separated improved (N and/or L) from unimproved plots; unimproved plots tied to Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum; improved plots linked to Festuca rubra with broader associated species (Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis).
    - Biomass correlation with species: higher biomass positively correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; negatively correlated with Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and some bryophyte-rich components; litter presence increased where N and/or lime were applied, indicating faster turnover with higher fertility.
    - Relative abundance and biomass: increased litter and turnover in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime; changes in dominance patterns tied to fertility treatment.

- 3. Site heterogeneity
  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) tended to be more acidic, a pattern partly confounded by higher proportions of Control/Biocide plots in those columns.
    - Underlying heterogeneity across the site associated with lower pH in N and/or Lime plots in those columns.
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
    - Biomass distribution showed outliers with the lowest biomass on several plots, and higher biomass on centrally located plots (e.g., N+L 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant differences in biomass between blocks, supporting a dominant influence of plot-level treatments and site heterogeneity.

- Data interpretation and implications for monitoring
  - Treatments that include nitrogen and/or lime reliably increased above-ground biomass and altered soil chemistry (pH), with potential shifts in plant community composition toward species associated with fertile conditions.
  - Biodiversity showed signs of narrowing under the most fertilised/high-fertility plots, suggesting a trade-off between productivity and species diversity.
  - Spatial heterogeneity within the site affects interpretation and underscores the importance of accounting for location effects when aggregating results.
  - Changes in mowing method and staffing can influence biomass measurements and should be considered in year-to-year comparisons.
  - The maintained weather and biomass datasets, along with standardized botanical surveys (Point Quadrat), enable cross-year linkages and integration with other project data and soil biodiversity analyses.

- Acknowledgements and data context
  - Acknowledges personnel contributions (e.g., Sarah Buckland) and MLURI Sourhope site staff; data are managed and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager; the report links to the Baseline Data Survey and the 1998–2001 measurement schedule, illustrating a consistent data framework for environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
