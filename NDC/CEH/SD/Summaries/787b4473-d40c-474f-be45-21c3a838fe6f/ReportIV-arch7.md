# Summary of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope

- Overview
  - Four-year intensive field study at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) focused on above-ground biomass productivity, plant species composition, and relative abundance (diversity).
  - Three main management processes driving botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and insecticide application; trampling effects also considered.
  - Functional plant traits (CSR framework) used to interpret community responses to soil and disturbance gradients.
  - Clear linkages between above- and below-ground processes emphasized; botanical monitoring complements the soil biodiversity focus.

- Site and Treatments
  - Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots, with end-user plots allocated to different research groups.
  - Treatments (applied post-1999): Control 1, Control 2 (no treatment); Nitrogen; Lime; Nitrogen and Lime (N&L); Insecticide (formerly Biocide).
  - Management activities: monthly mowing May–Sept to ~6 cm; insecticide (Dursban 4) applied to Insecticide plots after mowing; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime as designated.

- Data Collection and Site Activity
  - On-site Automatic Weather Station for regular climate data (rainfall, radiation, temperature).
  - Above-ground productivity: harvest biomass from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots before each mow; drying and weighing standardised.
  - Baseline botanical survey in 1998; annual point-analysis surveys in 2000–2002 using a 0.5 m2 cell with 100-point grid and 25-point pin-downs; bryophytes identified to species level in 2002.
  - Soil measurements: soil pH (5 cm depth) annually; soil moisture measured in July/August 2002; additional small-scale vegetation surveys and biomass sorting (species-level).
  - Research activity: Phase I projects largely completed by 2002; Phase II fieldwork extensive with CO2 pulse experiments and gas measurements during mid-2002.

- Key Results and Trends (Biomass and Diversity)
  - Biomass productivity: overall, biomass increased across treatments from 1999–2002, with the strongest gains in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime; 2002 biomass slightly lower than 2001 (overall reductions 13.7% to 31.2% depending on treatment).
  - Treatment effects on productivity: nitrogen and lime together produced the highest productivity; unfertilised plots showed declines relative to fertilised plots.
  - Spatial pattern: a clear slope/location effect; Block 5 (upper slope) showed the greatest declines in biomass, while Block 1 (lower slope) also showed notable declines in certain years.
  - Relationship with soil chemistry: lime markedly increased soil pH (near 7.0 in limed plots); nitrogen also raised pH modestly; higher pH generally associated with higher biomass, but the relationship varied by treatment (positive overall, but sometimes weakening or reversing when both N and lime were applied).
  - Soil moisture-pH interaction: negative correlation between moisture and pH; patterns of biomass linked to the balance of pH and moisture.
  - Point-analysis community shifts: improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) dominated in fertilised plots; unimproved plots showed rising bryophyte abundance (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) and bryophyte biomass contribution increased over 2000–2002.
  - Species composition changes: Agrostis spp. declined markedly ( > 40% since 2000); Festuca ovina declined while Festuca rubra increased in improved plots; overall, two Festuca spp. and Agrostis spp. remained dominant across the site with shifts in relative abundance by treatment.
  - Diversity metrics: Shannon diversity indices increased from 2000 onward, with significant treatment differences emerging; by 2002, nitrogen-and-lime plots showed a drop in Shannon diversity relative to other treatments.
  - Functional groups (CSR): three main functional groups (stress-tolerators S, competitive-stress-ruderal CSR mix, and SR/CSR) accounted for most plant hits; C-S-R and SR/C-S-R increased in N&L plots, while unimproved plots favored stress-tolerant species; overall, management amplified shifts toward competitive-stress strategies in fertile plots and stress-tolerant strategies in poorer plots.
  - Insecticide effect: potential link between reduced herbivory and higher diversity suggested but not definitively proven; results align with literature showing complex plant–insect interactions.

- Specific Analyses and Patterns
  - Mowing effect: reduction in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across almost all treatments since 2000; Festuca rubra expanded, especially in lime- and nitrogen-amended plots; mosses/bryophytes expanded across the site, likely aided by maintained sward height (~6 cm) and absence of grazing.
  - Fertilisation effect: sustained productivity gains since 1999 with N and/or lime; potential productivity peak in N+L plots by 2002 linked with high soil pH and drier conditions; increased risk of water stress in high-pH, high-nitrogen plots.
  - Insecticide effect: possible rise in diversity in some plots if herbivory suppression allowed palatable species to persist, but evidence is not conclusive.
  - Trampling effect: first-time biomass sampling in C2 plots in 2002 suggests trampling during 13CO2 pulses may have suppressed growth in those plots.

- Data and Visualization Resources for GIS
  - Weather and climate: Appendix 5 on-site weather data (1999–2002) including rainfall, radiation, and temperatures.
  - Biomass data: Appendix 6 provides annual biomass per plot; Appendix 7 ranks biomass samples per plot (time-series by block and treatment).
  - Species and community data: Appendix 3 (species list), Appendix 8 (rank abundance by treatment and year), and PCA outputs showing groupings of improved vs unimproved plots (Figures 5a–b).
  - Soil chemistry and moisture: soil pH (Appendix 3, Figure 3), soil moisture (July/August 2002), and correlations with productivity (Figure 4).
  - Treatment map: Appendix 1 provides a map of plot-level treatments; Appendix 2 details application schedules for nitrogen, lime, and insecticide.
  - Bryophyte data: bryophyte hits and species distribution across treatments (notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and others) with increasing bryophyte contribution to total hits over time.
  - Functional groups: Table 2 and related figures (CSR, S, SR/CSR, and C-S-R distributions) across years.

- Implications for GIS Data Products
  - Build spatial layers for each plot: treatment type, biomass productivity, soil pH, soil moisture, and bryophyte/vascular plant composition.
  - Time-series layers (1998–2002) to visualize longitudinal changes and treatment effects.
  - Map functional-group distributions (S, CSR, SR/CSR) to illustrate ecological strategies across the gradient.
  - Integrate weather/climate data with plot-level responses to explore climate–management interactions.
  - Use PCA/cluster outputs to classify plots into groupings (improved vs unimproved) for mapping and decision support.

- Conclusion and Takeaways
  - Management and soil chemistry jointly shape plant productivity and community structure; fertilisation markedly boosts productivity but interacts with moisture and pH to influence stress-tolerance vs competitive traits.
  - Mowing drives shifts toward stress-tolerant species and bryophyte expansion; trampling and insecticide effects are more nuanced but potentially influence diversity and community composition.
  - The dataset provides rich, spatially explicit information suitable for GIS-based analysis and map-driven data products to explore spatial patterns, treatments, and ecological functioning across the Sourhope site.
