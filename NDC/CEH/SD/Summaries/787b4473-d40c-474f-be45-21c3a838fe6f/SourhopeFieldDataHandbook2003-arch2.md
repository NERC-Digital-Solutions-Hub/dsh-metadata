SOIL ANALYSIS OF RIGG FOOT, SOURHOPE : BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES

## Overview and purpose
- Part of Sourhope field data set focusing on long-term soil and vegetation monitoring at Rigg Foot.
- Provides detailed chemical, physical, and moisture analyses from auger samples in Block 4, with accompanying vegetation data and ECOTRON plot context.
- Aimed at enabling standardized, site-scale monitoring and cross-site comparisons within the ECN and MLURI data infrastructure.

## Sampling design and methods (Block 4)
- Soil sampling: 30 auger cores per plot (depth 0–30 cm) collected in a W-pattern; samples labeled and archived with MLURI barcodes (4A–4F).
- Sub-sampling protocol: Each core processed for immediate analysis and archival storage at -80°C for future work.
- Vegetation surveys: 50 × 50 cm point quadrats within randomly selected five of the fifteen subplots per main plot; data recorded as presence/absence with potential abundance estimates.
- Data capture: Includes Mg, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %N, %C, C:N, pH (H2O and CaCl2), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, and weight (mg) per core for each sampled subplot.
- ECOTRON context: An ECOTRON plot data record accompanies Block 4 to link soil chemistry with controlled environmental monitoring.

## Key soil chemistry and physical results (Block 4 auger samples)
- Samples 4A–4F show:
  - Weight: ~5.67–6.21 mg per core.
  - %N: 0.51–0.58; %C: 6.80–8.02; C:N: 12.62–14.26.
  - Cations (meq/100 g): Ca 1.11–2.96; Na 0.12–0.15; K 0.58–0.81; Mg 0.58–1.59.
  - %Moisture loss: 4.29–5.15; %Loss on Ignition: 14.60–17.96.
  - pH (H2O): 4.45–4.82; pH (CaCl2): 3.64–4.05.
- Block-level patterns (Block 4):
  - Soils are acidic (pH ~4.5–4.8) with moderate organic content (C around 7–8% in upper horizons) and relatively low base cations.
  - LOI (Loss on Ignition) values indicate substantial organic matter and humification in surface horizons (up to ~17.9%).
  - Ca and Mg vary across subplots, with Mg often closely tied to C content and LOI; Na shows consistently low values.
  - pH (CaCl2) consistently lower than pH (H2O), reflecting soil acidity affecting exchangeable cations.
- Data quality and patterns:
  - Block-level anomalies exist (notably Blocks 4 and 5 differences across plots), highlighting spatial variability within Block 4 monitoring.

## Vegetation survey results (Block 4)
- Plot-level species composition shows a mix of grasses and forbs typical of upland pasture, with indicator species including Deschampsia flexuosa, Deschampsia cespitosa, Agrostis capillaris, Holcus mollis, Ranunculus repens, Carex binervis, and Juncus effusus.
- NVC alignment: Most plots align with U4d (Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland with Luzula multiflora-Rhytidiadelphus loreus subcommunity) or U5b (Nardus stricta-Galium saxatile grassland with Agrostis canina-Polytrichum commune subcommunity) in moister/damper zones.
- Data provide counts per subplot and species totals, useful for tracking floristic changes in response to grazing, nutrient input, and climate variability.

## ECOTRON soil site (Block 4 ECOTRON plot)
- Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT 1):
  - Weight: 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83.
  - Ca 2.76; Na 0.15; K 0.62; Mg 1.70.
  - %Moisture loss 4.79; %Loss on Ignition 17.42; pH (H2O) 4.79; pH (CaCl2) 3.82.
- Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT) records species counts across subplots, enabling comparison with the main Block 4 plots under controlled environmental conditions.

## Block 5 data context (related but separate block)
- Site details: Block 5 at Sourhope (Grid NT8544019520), elevation ~315 m; Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material and horizon sequence described.
- Soil profile (0–100 cm) with horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; detailed descriptions of soil texture, color, structure, roots, and stone content.
- Analytical results by horizon (selected highlights):
  - FH: pH(H2O) ~4.66; pH(CaCl2) ~4.48; %N ~2.05; %C ~33.81; LOI ~67%; Ca ~11.91 meq/100g; Mg ~5.92 meq/100g; %Moisture loss ~8.16.
  - H: pH(H2O) ~5.20; pH(CaCl2) ~4.41; %N ~2.17; %C ~31.06; LOI ~59.64; Ca ~12.54; Mg ~5.50.
  - Ah: pH(H2O) ~4.34; pH(CaCl2) ~3.88; %N ~0.65; %C ~9.36; LOI ~19.27; Ca ~2.38; Mg ~1.52.
  - AB to Bg horizons show progressively lower N and C, with Ca and Mg values generally decreasing with depth; LOI and moisture loss decline from surface to deeper horizons.
  - Cg horizon (deepest) shows relatively low N and C with higher Ca and Mg in deeper horizons.
- Auger samples (Block 5) similarly present per-sample values for weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, and pH (H2O and CaCl2), illustrating horizon- and block-level variability.
- Vegetation data for Block 5 reflect the same survey approach as Block 4, detailing species totals per plot and per subplot, with distribution indicating floristic heterogeneity across the block.

## Data management and monitoring context
- Data are organized with MLURI barcodes and ECN integration, enabling long-term data storage, archiving, and cross-site comparability.
- The standardized sampling and analysis (soil augers, 0–30 cm depth, subplots, vegetation quadrats, NVC/indicator species approach) support monitoring of grazing effects, nutrient management, and biodiversity outcomes over time.
- Block-to-block variability (e.g., Block 4 vs Block 5) highlights the need for careful interpretation when applying site-wide trends to policy and management decisions.

## Key takeaways for environmental monitoring analysts
- Sourhope provides robust, long-term, standardized data on soil chemistry, soil organic content, moisture dynamics, and vegetation to assess ecosystem health under varying management.
- Block 4 auger data indicate acidic soils with relatively high organic content in surface horizons and pronounced horizon-based variability; block-level patterns align with local topography and soil series.
- ECOTRON and block-specific datasets enable cross-site analyses within the ECN framework, aiding interpretation of grazing, nutrient inputs, and climate-related environmental changes.
- Data accessibility and block-specific anomalies present challenges that require careful data integration and transparent reporting to support policy-relevant analyses.
