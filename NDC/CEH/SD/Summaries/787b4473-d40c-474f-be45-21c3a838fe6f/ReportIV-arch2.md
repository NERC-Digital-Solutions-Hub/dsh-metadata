# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

## Overview

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Focus on above-ground productivity, plant community composition, and plant diversity in a large field experiment.
- Five replicate blocks with multiple plot-level treatments; monitoring linked to below-ground and broader ecosystem processes through multiple projects.

## Site, Treatments and Management

- Location: Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute farm; Rigg Foot Experimental Site with 5 blocks.
- Treatments (main plots): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide.
- Management regime (annual since 1999): monthly mowing to ~6 cm May–Sept; insecticide (Dursban 4) applied after mowing on Insecticide plots; nitrogen and/or lime added in spring to designated plots.
- Experimental design: 5 blocks, each with 6 main plots subdivided into sub-plots; 0.5 m2 sampling cells allocated to research groups.

## Data Collection and Metrics

- Weather: On-site Automatic Weather Station recording temperature, rainfall, radiation, and soil moisture since February 1999.
- Above-ground productivity: regular 0.5 m2 vegetation samples clipped before each mow, dried, and weighed (1999–2002 data).
- Baseline and longitudinal botanical surveys: 0.5 m2 point quadrats (baseline 1998; annual 2000–2002 surveys); bryophytes identified to species level in 2002.
- Soil measures: soil pH (surface 5 cm) regularly; soil moisture measured in 2002 in the botanical sampling cells.
- Additional small surveys: vegetation cover in minirhizotron plots, biomass sorting by species, and various targeted plant and bryophyte surveys.
- Data handling: extensive appendices detailing site activity, species lists, biomass data, and point-analysis results.

## Key Findings (2002) and Trends (1999–2002)

- Biomass and productivity
  - Long-term biomass production increased across all treatments since 1999.
  - 2002 biomass declined relative to 2001; most productive plots remained those with nitrogen and lime together (N&L).
  - Control 2 plots showed lower productivity than Control 1 in several years; slope position affected productivity (lower slope areas tended to show greater declines over time).

- Fertilisation and soil chemistry
  - Lime raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (drier plots tended to be more alkaline).
  - Positive association between higher soil pH and above-ground productivity at the landscape level; in some treatments, the relationship weakened or reversed when nitrogen and lime were both added.

- Plant community composition and functional groups
  - In improved plots (N, Lime, N&L), Festuca rubra increased and Agrostis capillaris/vinealis declined, indicating a shift toward species associated with higher fertility.
  - Unimproved plots (Control and Insecticide) showed increased bryophyte abundance, notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, and greater diversity of bryophytes over time.
  - Point analysis showed increased frequency of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in fertilised plots, while Agrostis spp. declined; bryophyte hits rose notably in unimproved plots.
  - Functional-group dynamics (CSR framework):
    - In N&L plots, C-S-R and SR/C-S-R species expanded, reflecting greater competitive ability and disturbance tolerance under improved conditions.
    - In unimproved plots, stress-tolerant (S) species benefited more, while ruderal components declined with altered disturbance regimes.
  - Diversity (Shannon index)
    - 2002: Shannon diversity declined by about 15% in N&L plots relative to baseline, while increases were observed in most other treatments (2–29%, with notable gains in Insecticide plots).

- Insecticide effect
  - Dursban 4 insecticide was applied to Insecticide plots; evidence suggests possible links between reduced herbivory and changes in plant diversity, but causality remains uncertain.
  - Some data indicate insecticide plots maintained or increased diversity relative to strongly fertilised plots, but interpretations are cautious due to complex plant–insect interactions.

- Trampling and trampling-related effects
  - 2002 sampling in C2 plots coincided with intense activity for 13CO2 pulses, likely suppressing vegetation growth and reducing productivity in those plots.

- Bryophytes and litter
  - Bryophyte abundance increased across the site, contributing to a larger portion of total hits in 2002, especially in unimproved plots; litter hits showed significant treatment differences in 2001–2002.

## Data Interpretations for Monitoring and Policy

- disturbance vs. fertility: Removing grazing disturbance (mowing only) and adding fertility (N and/or lime) drives major shifts in species composition and function, with a move toward competitive, C-S-R dominated communities in fertile plots and stress-tolerant communities in unfertilised plots.
- moss expansion as a marker: Regular mowing with long-standing grazing exclusion may promote bryophyte expansion, indicating changes in microhabitat moisture and sward structure.
- productivity vs. water availability: High soil pH and fertilisation can increase productivity but may elevate water stress risk in dry periods if soil moisture is reduced.
- data richness and integration: The study demonstrates extensive data collection (biomass, point analyses, soil chemistry, bryophyte inventory, microhabitat measurements) suitable for long-term monitoring and cross-project data integration.

## Data Quality and Accessibility

- The project generates a large, multi-year dataset (over 11,600 soil samples to date) with detailed treatment, species, and biomass records.
- Some 2002 data gaps due to weather-station malfunction; where necessary, data were substituted from nearby stations, and explicit notes on missing periods are provided.
- Appendices include comprehensive site- and plot-level treatment summaries, species lists, and biomass/time-series data to support data reuse and cross-study analyses.

## Endnotes and References

- The report references foundational works on plant functional types (CSR framework) and related grassland ecology, highlighting the theoretical basis for interpreting changes in productivity and community structure.
- Appendices provide extended data tables and species lists for reproducibility and further analysis.
