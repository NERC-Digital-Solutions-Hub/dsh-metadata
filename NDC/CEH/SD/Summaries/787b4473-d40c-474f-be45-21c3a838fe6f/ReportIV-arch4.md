# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme — Sourhope Site Summary

- Overview
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Monitoring has targeted above-ground biomass productivity, plant species composition, and diversity, in relation to five main management aspects.

- Treatments and Experimental Design
  - Site management: mowing the entire vegetation to ~6 cm height monthly (May–Sept).
  - Plot-level treatments (five fertilization/management regimes): 
    - Control 1 (no treatment)
    - Control 2 (no treatment)
    - Nitrogen (N)
    - Lime (L)
    - Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide treatment (formerly Biocide): Dursban 4 (chlorpyrifos) applied to insecticide plots after mowing.
  - Experimental layout: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots with research-group allocations.

- Data Collection and Methods
  - Weather: continuous recordings from an on-site Automatic Weather Station (AWS).
  - Productivity: regular harvests from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells; samples oven-dried and weighed.
  - Baseline and follow-up botanical surveys: 0.5 m2 point quadrats with 25-point baseline (1998); annual 100-hole point analysis in 2000–2002; bryophyte identification enhanced in 2002.
  - Soil and microclimate: soil pH measured at ~5 cm; soil moisture measured in 2002 with theta probe; limited soil data from ongoing surveys.
  - Vegetation analyses: biomass data (multiyear) and point-analysis data (species hits by treatment); PCA and Shannon diversity indices used to assess community structure and diversity.
  - Site activity: fieldwork across Phase I (1998–2001) largely finished by 2002; Phase II groups conducted major fieldwork including labelled CO2 pulses; access restrictions due to foot-and-mouth in 2001–2002.

- Key Findings on Productivity and Soil Chemistry
  - Productivity trends:
    - Fertilised plots (N and/or Lime) showed higher above-ground biomass than unfertilised plots; the strongest productivity occurred in plots with both nitrogen and lime.
    - By 2002, total biomass across most treatments declined relative to 2001 (13.7% in N&L to 31.2% in Control 2); however, there was still a long-term increase in biomass from 1999 baseline across treatments.
    - A slope-location effect: block position correlated with productivity changes, with deeper declines in some blocks and relatively smaller changes in others.
  - Soil pH and moisture:
    - Lime raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in limed plots; nitrogen raised pH modestly.
    - A negative correlation between soil moisture and soil pH was observed, with drier plots tending toward higher pH.
    - Positive, general relationship between higher soil pH and above-ground productivity when pooling treatments; within certain treatments (N or Lime alone) the relationship weakened or flipped when both N and Lime were added.

- Plant Community and Diversity Changes
  - Species composition:
    - Improved pastures species (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) increased in fertilised plots; Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined (over 40% reduction since 2000) across most treatments, suggesting a mowing- or disturbance-related shift.
    - Bryophytes (notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increased across the site, contributing to higher bryophyte hits in 2001–2002, especially in unimproved plots.
  - Functional groups (CSR framework):
    - The predominant functional groups were stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderals (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderal (SR/CSR).
    - By 2002, C-S-R (competitive-stress-tolerant) species expanded notably in N&L plots; S species dominated unimproved plots; SR/CSR reduced in lime-treated plots.
    - Overall, treatment differences in functional group composition became statistically significant in 2000–2002.
  - Diversity measures:
    - Shannon diversity index showed treatment-dependent changes:
      - 2002: a 15% decline in diversity in N&L plots versus baseline.
      - Diversity increases observed in other treatments: 2% (lime) to as high as 29% (insecticide plots).
  - Species-level and community structure:
    - Point Analysis showed Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis as indicators of improved fertility, while Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum were more associated with unimproved plots.
    - PCA of point-analyses separated improved vs unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots forming a distinct group; some N-treated samples clustered with limed plots, while others aligned with controls or insecticide plots.
    - Bryophytes accounted for a rising portion of total hits, particularly in unimproved plots, contributing to shifts in biomass composition.

- Insecticide and Trampling Effects
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4) effects:
    - Possible link between reduced herbivory and higher diversity, consistent with theoretical expectations, though direct causation is cautioned due to limited mechanistic data.
  - Trampling effects:
    - First-time sampling in C2 plots in 2002 suggests trampling during CO2 pulse activities likely reduced local productivity, explaining part of the observed decline in those plots.

- Endnotes and Context
  - The report emphasizes long-term data collection value for cross-disciplinary understanding of data in soil biodiversity contexts.
  - Phase II involvement expanded data collection efforts, including CO2 pulses and trace-gas measurements using mobile laboratories.
  - Some weather data gaps occurred in 2002 due to equipment issues; adjustments were made using nearby weather station data.

- Implications for Data Leaders (Data Strategy Perspective)
  - Value of a long-running, multi-factor experiment for systems-level data governance and cross-domain insights.
  - Importance of comprehensive metadata and standardized protocols (plot-level treatments, mowing schedules, sampling methods) to enable cross-year comparability and replication.
  - Use of diverse analytical approaches (ANOVA, PCA, FSC/CSR frameworks, diversity indices) to interpret complex, multivariate data.
  - Need for transparent documentation of data gaps (e.g., 2002 weather data losses) and data provenance to support reproducibility.
  - Opportunity to integrate ecological measurements (biomass, species hits, bryophyte data, soil chemistry, moisture, weather) into interoperable datasets for broader ecosystem analyses and cross-site comparisons.
