# SUMMARY

- The document reports four years of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on how above-ground biomass (productivity), plant species composition, and diversity respond to five site treatments under a mowing regime.
- Key management processes driving botanical changes are mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and lime), and insecticide application, with trampling also discussed in the context of data from C2 plots.
- The study integrates above-ground biomass measurements, plant community surveys (point analysis), bryophyte records, soil pH and moisture data, and weather data to understand how treatments alter ecosystem function.

## Context and Aims

- Objective: Understand links between soil biodiversity, plant communities, and ecosystem processes by examining above- and below-ground interactions and feedbacks.
- Location: Sourhope field site, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders.
- Experimental scope: 5 replicate blocks with 6 main plots per block, subdivided into sub-plots for 16 projects; long-term monitoring of productivity, species composition, and diversity under multiple treatments.

## Experimental Design and Treatments

- Treatments (applied to plotting units): 
  - Control 1 (no treatment)
  - Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Lime (L)
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA; previously called Biocide)
- Management regime:
  - Mowing: monthly from May to September to ~6 cm height (site-wide)
  - Insecticide applied after mowing on treated plots
  - Fertilisers applied in spring (N and/or lime per treatment)
- Data collection framework:
  - Weather data from an on-site Automatic Weather Station (since Feb 1999)
  - Above-ground biomass: 0.5 m2 samples from sub-plots, harvested monthly during May–Sept and oven-dried
  - Baseline and follow-up botanical surveys using point analysis (0.5 m2 cell with 100-point grid; 25 points per sub-plot)
  - Soil sampling: soil pH every ~5 cm; soil moisture (theta probe) in 2002
  - Additional surveys: small-scale vegetation plots and biomass sorting by species
  - Research activity: Phase I projects largely complete by 2002; Phase II fieldwork with additional lab-based measurements (e.g., 13CO2 pulses)

## Data Collected and Analyses

- Temporal and spatial coverage:
  - Biomass data collected 1999–2002; cross-year comparisons and normalisation to Control 1
  - Point analysis surveys conducted baseline (1998) and in 2000, 2001, 2002
  - Soil pH monitored since 1998; moisture measured in 2002
  - Bryophyte and vascular plant species documented; Appendix 3 lists species observed
- Analytical approaches:
  - Split-plot ANOVA (Genstat 6) on ln-transformed biomass to test Treatment, Year, and interactions
  - Pairwise comparisons and LSD post-hoc tests for year-specific treatment effects
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on 2002 point analysis data with treatment-based ranking
  - Shannon Diversity Indices computed from point analyses across years
  - Functional grouping of species using the CSR framework (Competitiveness, Stress-tolerance, Ruderal), with SR/CSR combinations analyzed over time
- Data integrity notes:
  - 2002 weather data included some missing dates due to a station malfunction; where needed, data were substituted from nearby Konza plots station data for portions of July–November
  - Block effects and slope position influenced productivity patterns

## Key Findings and Trends (2002 and Across Years)

- Biomass productivity:
  - The strongest biomass response is in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime (N&L); these plots remain the most productive overall
  - In 2002, absolute biomass declined across most treatments vs 2001, though long-term growth from 1999 onward remains positive relative to the 1999 baseline
  - Fertilised plots generally outperform unfertilised ones; Control 2 plots show the lowest productivity in several years
  - A slope-position effect exists: lower blocks (downslope) tended to show larger relative declines in biomass
- Soil chemistry and moisture:
  - Lime markedly raises soil pH toward ~7 in the upper soil profile
  - Nitrogen has a smaller but significant positive effect on pH
  - A strong negative correlation exists between soil moisture and soil pH
  - Across treatments, a positive relationship generally exists between higher pH and biomass, but this relationship weakens or reverses in N-only or L-only plots and becomes negative in N&L plots, suggesting complex interactions
- Plant community composition and functional groups:
  - Mowing reduces Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis by over 40% since 2000, with Festuca rubra expanding in fertilised (lime-containing) plots
  - Bryophytes, especially Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, increase across the site, associated with reduced disturbance and mowing
  - Point analysis shows fertilised plots dominated by grasses associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis); unimproved plots retain Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum
  - Diversity (Shannon index) changes: increasing in fertilised/insecticide plots over time; nitrogen&lime plots show slight declines by 2002 relative to baseline
  - Functional group shifts (CSR framework):
    - C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species expand in N&L plots
    - Stress-tolerators (S) expand in unimproved plots
    - SR/CSR groups decline in lime- and insecticide-treated plots
- Insecticide effects:
  - Insecticide plots exhibit relatively higher Shannon diversity by 2002, consistent with some literature linking reduced herbivory to altered plant community structure
  - The precise causal link between insecticide use and diversity remains cautiously interpreted due to data limitations
- Trampling and C2 plots:
  - The first year of C2 data collection coincided with intensive 13CO2 pulses, likely suppressing vegetation growth in those plots and contributing to notable reductions in productivity for C2 relative to C1

## Outputs, Data Products, and Implications

- Data products described include:
  - Annual and plot-level above-ground biomass totals
  - Normalised treatment biomass comparisons over years
  - Point analysis results: species hits per treatment, bryophyte hits, and diversity indices
  - PCA visuals illustrating treatment clustering and species loadings
  - Appendix data: species lists, site treatments, weather data, biomass per plot, and rank analyses
- Implications for data use:
  - The dataset supports dashboards showing treatment effects on productivity, community composition, and functional-type shifts
  - Data can power self-serve exploration of how pH, moisture, and fertilisation drive biomass and diversity
  - The strong role of bryophyte dynamics suggests dashboards should track moss/faceted vegetation changes alongside vascular plants
  - The CSR framework provides a basis for predicting functional responses under future management scenarios

## Limitations and Considerations for Interpretation

- Missing 2002 weather data due to station malfunction; some dates substituted from alternate sources
- Spatial heterogeneity from slope position affects results; block-level differences may confound treatment effects
- Insecticide effects on diversity are suggestive but not definitively causal due to limited mechanistic data
- Trampling effects appear plot-specific (not universal) and tied to experimental pulses

## Appendices and Data Access

- Appendix 3: Comprehensive species list (vascular plants and bryophytes)
- Appendix 5: Weather station headline measures (1999–2002)
- Appendix 6–8: Biomass data, biomass rankings, and rank-abundance by treatment/year
- Appendix 1–4: Site maps, treatment layouts, and site activity summaries

- Overall, the document provides a rich, multi-faceted dataset linking management interventions (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) to plant productivity, community composition, bryophyte dynamics, and functional-group shifts, supported by robust statistical analyses and long-term monitoring.
