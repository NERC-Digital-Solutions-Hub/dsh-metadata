# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Large field experiment at Sourhope, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Objective: provide context for various groups studying soil biodiversity and enable year-to-year comparisons.
  - 1998–2001: site management and data collection aligned to a predefined baseline; 2001 saw disruptions due to Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions and a change of site officer.

- Data Collected and Measures
  - Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - Headline measures near long-term averages: rainfall ~839 mm (2001), radiation ~3473 MJ/m2.
    - Slightly cooler temperatures and higher soil moisture compared with prior years.
  - Above-ground Biomass (1999–2001)
    - Treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Biocide.
    - Biomass generally peaks in July–August; 2001 biomass higher than in 1999–2000, likely due to staff changes and switch to mechanical mowing.
    - Biomass analyses: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; blocks not significant.
    - Normalization against C1 used to compare across years due to methodological shift in mowing.
  - Soil pH (upper 5 cm)
    - Lime increased pH significantly; October 2001 pH: limed plots ~6.19, N&L ~6.38; nitrogen alone raised pH modestly; control stable since baseline (1998).
  - Botanical Composition (Point Quadrat Survey, July 2001)
    - 2001 survey showed 58% more hits than 2000 across treatments.
    - Species turnover and abundance shifts by treatment:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments (except remaining abundant in Control and Limed).
      - Festuca spp. increased across treatments; strongest presence in fertilized plots (F. rubra in N&L; F. ovina in N).
      - Fertilized plots showed more species associated with improved pastures (Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis); unimproved plots had more Nardus stricta and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
      - Biodiversity: 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in improved plots (possible initial decline in diversity with stronger fertilization/liming).
    - Multivariate analysis: Principal Components Analysis separates nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; biomass correlates with certain species (e.g., Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis align with higher biomass).
    - Relative abundance of major species correlated with summer biomass (e.g., Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis increase with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline as biomass rises).

- Site Heterogeneity and Spatial Variation
  - Spatial patterns: columns E and F exhibited comparatively more acidic plots; within those columns, nitrogen and/or lime plots tended to be more acidic.
  - Biomass distribution: higher biomass typically in plots more centrally located on site; low biomass in outlying plots (examples listed across treatment types).
  - Relationship: strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass across plots; no significant differences between blocks.

- Data Quality, Management Changes, and Limitations
  - 2001 disruptions: FMD restricted site access Feb–May 2001; first biocide application in May missed; subsequent biocide applications completed.
  - Change of site officer (May 2001) and potential effects on sampling cadence and data consistency.
  - Methodological note: a shift from manual mowing to mechanical shearing in 2001 necessitated normalization of biomass data against the Control 1 plot (C1) to enable year-to-year comparisons.
  - Data presentation includes extensive tables and figures (Tables 1–6; Figures 1–9; Appendix 1) and species codes for detailed interpretation.

- Implications for Data Leaders
  - Demonstrates the value of comprehensive, multi-parameter data collection to interpret how management decisions (nitrogen, lime, biocide) influence productivity and biodiversity over time.
  - Highlights the need for robust data governance:
    - Document and preserve metadata for changes in measurement methods and site management (e.g., mowing technique, staff changes, external disruptions).
    - Ensure cross-year comparability through consistent protocols and transparent normalization methods.
    - Capture spatial heterogeneity explicitly (site columns, plot location) to contextualize treatment effects.
  - Emphasizes linking data products to user needs:
    - Researchers across networks can benefit from integrated data (weather, biomass, soil pH, plant community data) with clear metadata and standardized formats.
  - Recommendations for data systems:
    - Maintain a detailed data dictionary and versioning to track methodological shifts.
    - Store and expose multi-modal data (continuous weather, periodic biomass, soil chemistry, and biodiversity surveys) with clear lineage and quality flags.
    - Incorporate spatial data (plot coordinates, column design) to support heterogeneity analyses and replication.
  - Opportunities for future work:
    - Use PCA and other multivariate methods routinely to explore treatment-driven community shifts.
    - Explore stronger data pipelines to mitigate impacts of site disruptions and maintain continuity in long-running field experiments.
