## Auger sampling (BLOCK 4)
- Sample set 4A–4F shows modest organic-rich surface with low to moderate N and C contents:
  - %N: 0.56–0.58; %C: 7.65–8.02; C:N: 12.62–14.26; Ca: 1.11–3.32; Mg: 0.58–1.59; K: 0.61–0.83; Na: 0.12–0.15; pH H2O: ~4.45–4.93; pH CaCl2: ~3.53–4.05; %Moisture loss: ~4.29–5.15; LOI: ~15.99–17.56.
- Overall, auger horizons reflect shallow mineral layers with low pH, modest exchangeable bases, and elevated LOI in surface horizons.

## Vegetation survey (BLOCK 4)
- Plot-level inventories for 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F indicate varying species totals and composition across subplots, with counts reported per subplot and per plot.
- Notable pattern: diversity and dominance signals differ across plots, reflecting microtopography and soil variation within Block 4.

## Ecotron soil site
- Soil analysis (Ecotron Plot 1): Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76; Na 0.15; K 0.62; Mg 1.70; %Moisture loss 4.79; LOI 17.42; pH H2O 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82.
- Vegetation survey (Ecotron Plot): presence/absence and abundance notes across subplots Ac–P with limited species totals recorded, consistent with controlled-environment experimental design.

## Data governance and provenance (BLOCK 4)
- Data collected under MLURI/ECN framework; barcodes and sample identifiers (MLURI Barcodes) documented for each horizon and auger sample.
- Datasets link to broader Sourhope project outputs (e.g., Twinspan/association analyses) and are archived with horizon- and plot-level metadata.
- Raw and processed data stored with horizon designations (LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bg, BCg, Cg) and horizon depths, enabling reproducibility and longitudinal comparison.

## Block 5 context (summary)
- Block 5 presents a separate soil profile with LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
- Soil descriptions across horizons indicate similar textures and structure transitions, including abundant igneous stones and mottling patterns.
- Analyses per horizon (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) include %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, and pH CaCl2, with horizon-specific values typical of Brown forest soil with gleying.
- Auger samples (5A–5F) provide comparable metadata for surface to subsoil horizons, with %N ~0.5–0.6, %C ~7–9, C:N ~10–14, Ca up to ~5, Mg up to ~3, pH H2O ~3.5–4.9, and LOI ~14–21.
- Vegetation survey (Block 5, plots 5A–5F) reports species totals per subplot, showing substantial variation in plant community composition across the block.
- Data management notes: Block 5 data are integrated into the same metadata framework as Block 4, enabling cross-block comparisons and long-term environmental studies.

## Practical guidance for data stewards
- Ensure horizon-level metadata includes depth (cm), horizon name, color/texture notes, and boundary types to support reproducibility.
- Maintain barcode/identifier traceability for every horizon, auger sample, and vegetation plot; link to archival specimens where applicable.
- Capture and preserve both raw data (e.g., original measurements) and processed data (means by horizon/plot, summary statistics) with clear provenance.
- Document data quality considerations, including any gaps, anomalies (e.g., blocks with unusual chemistry), and sampling coverage limits.
- Facilitate data sharing with clear licensing, citations, and references to project outputs (baseline reports, Twinspan/Association analyses) to aid reuse.
