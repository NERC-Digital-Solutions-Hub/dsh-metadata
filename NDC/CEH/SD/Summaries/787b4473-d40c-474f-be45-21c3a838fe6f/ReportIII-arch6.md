# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Context and aims
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, studying a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Provided a broad monitoring context to support many groups’ data interpretation and cross-year comparisons.
- Documentation references an earlier Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998) for site rationale, design, methods, and management.
- Aimed to enable data users to recognise links with their data and compare across years; measurements span weather, biomass, soil pH, and plant community composition.

## Data collection, design, and management
- Site management and data collection described as per the 1998 Baseline Survey; Table 1 lists types and dates of measurements.
- Experimental setup:
  - Treatments include: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide.
  - Sub-plots within plots (S, T, U, V) and five blocks per plot.
- Measurements and protocols:
  - Above-ground biomass sampled multiple times during the summer (five mowing occasions each year, using 0.5 m2 cells; dried and weighed; data subsequently summed per year).
  - Point Analysis botanical surveys conducted in July (2000 and 2001; ~50% of quadrats per surveyor; 100-cell grid with pins).
  - Additional surveys (minirhizotron-related) and disturbance/nutrient surveys conducted on specific subplots.
  - Automatic Weather Station on-site collects headline measures; data transmitted to MLURI data manager.
- 2001 management context:
  - Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) restrictions Feb–May 2001 limited site visits; normal activities resumed under veterinary protocols.
  - Change of site officer in May 2001.
  - Biocide application schedule: first application in May 2001 missed; subsequent applications completed.

## Key results by data type

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather data generally within long-term norms; rainfall near average after very wet preceding year.
- Total rainfall ~839 mm (2001); radiation ~3473 MJ/m2; average temperatures modestly lower than prior years; higher soil moisture than earlier years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Treatments show a consistent hierarchy in biomass production; peaks occur in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass higher than previous years, attributed to personnel changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Biomass analyses normalized to C1 to compare treatment effects across years.
- Findings (ANOVA):
  - Significant differences between improved plots (Nitrogen and/or Lime) vs non-improved plots (Control/Biocide).
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant differences between blocks.
- Interpretation: nitrogen and lime jointly enhance productivity; treatment effects persist when accounting for year-to-year changes.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Upper 5 cm soil pH responds to lime and nitrogen additions.
- Lime application raises pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots ~6.19; Nitrogen & Lime plots ~6.38.
- Control plots show no significant pH change since baseline (Aug 1998).
- Nitrogen alone also raises pH, but less than lime-containing treatments.

### 2.4 Botanical composition (Point Analysis)
- 2001 survey: total hits 58% higher than 2000, across all treatments, suggesting increased sward density (potentially due to reduced grazing since 1998).
- Species composition shifts by treatment:
  - Agrostis capillaris (dominant in 2000) declines across all treatments in 2001; persists most in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. increase across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen (Festuca ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (Festuca rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots (Nitrogen and/or Lime) show more Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis; fertilised plots especially with both N and Lime show these species.
  - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in untreated controls.
  - Diversity: unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) show 24 species; Nitrogen & Lime plots show 18 species, suggesting possible initial decline in diversity in the most improved plots.
- Multivariate analysis:
  - PCA separates plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime from control/biocide plots.
  - Improved plots show higher frequency of Festuca rubra (and its associates Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis).
  - Control/unimproved plots cluster with bryophyte-rich and Nardus/Anthoxanthum presence.
- Biomass vs species abundance relationships:
  - Positive correlations: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance increases with biomass.
  - Negative correlations: Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline as biomass increases.
- Litter and turnover:
  - Increase in litter frequency in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: Columns E and F tend to be more acidic; underlying pattern persists even after accounting for treatment distribution (often Controls or Biocide in these columns).
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime plots in these columns show comparatively lower pH.
- 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
  - Some plots consistently outliers with lower biomass (specific plot IDs listed); central plots often have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass across plots.

## Data products and implications for data use
- Longitudinal, multi-parameter dataset enabling cross-year comparisons (1999–2001) and linkage to baseline (1998) data.
- Data types suitable for dashboards and self-service analytics:
  - Biomass productivity by treatment and year (including normalised comparisons).
  - Soil pH response by treatment over time (including lime and nitrogen effects).
  - Botanical composition trends by treatment (species abundances, diversity indicators, PCA loadings).
  - Weather context to interpret growth patterns (rainfall, radiation, temperature, soil moisture).
- Observations useful for policy and management discussions:
  - Nutrient and lime addition drives productivity and pH changes; diversity may decline in some high-productivity plots.
  - Spatial heterogeneity should be considered when aggregating results or comparing plots.

## Conclusion and considerations for future work
- The Sourhope field experiment provides integrated insight into how nitrogen, lime, and their combination affect biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community structure under field conditions.
- Management disruptions in 2001 (FMD restrictions) and a change in site leadership influenced biomass measurements, underscoring the need to account for human factors in longitudinal data interpretation.
- The dataset supports cross-year analyses and can inform data products that enable end users to explore treatment effects, soil–plant dynamics, and spatial variability.
