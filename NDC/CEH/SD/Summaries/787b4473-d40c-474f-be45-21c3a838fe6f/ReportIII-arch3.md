# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Purpose and scope
- Large, intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, linked to the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for detailed studies and to enable year-to-year comparisons across measured variables.
- Baseline data collection documented in a November 1998 survey; results presented to facilitate linkage with other data and cross-year evaluation.

## Monitoring design and data collection

- Experimental setup
  - Plots with treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Biocide across multiple blocks.
  - Data across 1999–2001 to assess treatment effects on productivity, soil chemistry, and plant community.
  - Management changes in 2001 included a shift from manual to mechanical mowing and a change in site leadership; both affected biomass measurements.
- Measurements and schedules
  - Above-ground biomass: five summer harvests per year (May–Sept), with biomass summed annually and ln-transformed for analyses.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July 2000 and July 2001) using a 100-cell frame; species hits recorded per plot; supplementary minirhizotron surveys on selected plots.
  - Soil pH: upper 5 cm measured; lime and nitrogen impacts on pH tracked over time.
  - Weather: Automatic Weather Station data collected and regularly transmitted to a data manager.
- Data analysis
  - Statistical approaches included split-plot ANOVA (Genstat 5), tics on biomass (ln-transformed), and multivariate analyses (Principal Components Analysis) to relate species assemblages to treatments.
  - Cross-year analyses examined inter-year effects and correlations between biomass and species abundance.
- Data governance and accessibility
  - Weather data were actively managed and shared with the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager; broader data sharing and metadata issues are discussed as part of monitoring challenges.

## Key results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 rainfall near long-term average; relative stability in total radiation.
- Average temperatures slightly lower in 2001; soil moisture modestly higher than in 2000.
- Overall weather patterns not unusually extreme compared with prior years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass production; peak biomass typically in July/August.
- 2001 biomass higher than previous years, likely due to a combination of personnel changes and shift to mechanical cutting.
- Normalising by C1 showed nitrogen and/or lime additions generally boosted productivity, with nitrogen plus lime the most effective.
- ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
- Biomass increases correlated with shifts in species composition and greater litter in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime application continued to raise surface pH: October 2001 pH ≈ 6.19 in limed plots, ≈ 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent; control plots remained near baseline.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 survey showed ~58% more hits than 2000, indicating denser swards, potentially from reduced grazing since 1998.
- Treatment effects on species abundance were evident:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased across treatments.
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) became more prominent in fertilised plots, especially with both Nitrogen and Lime.
  - Unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) supported a higher diversity (24 species) than the Nitrogen & Lime plots (18 species), suggesting potential initial declines in diversity with higher fertility.
- Multivariate analysis (PCA) generally separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots showed more uniform communities with bryophyte and Nardus associations.
- Biomass was positively correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; negative correlations observed for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis as biomass increased.
- Increased litter presence associated with higher soil fertility (N and/or Lime) due to faster vegetation turnover.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F tended to be more acidic than others, a pattern partly linked to treatment distribution (more controls/biocide in those columns) and slope orientation.
- Overall, underlying spatial variability across the site influenced pH differences among plots.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Biomass showed outliers with the lowest values in several plots, while higher biomass tended to occur in centrally located plots.
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, indicating fertility and pH as drivers of productivity.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks, but notable spatial structure at the plot level.

## Implications for monitoring and policy

- Data interpretation must account for management changes (staff, mowing methods) that can substantially affect measured productivity and community composition.
- Demonstrates the importance of incorporating site heterogeneity into monitoring frameworks, including spatial stratification and baseline variability.
- Highlights the value of multi-tactor experimental designs (fertility, pH, biocides) to disentangle effects on biomass, soil chemistry, and species assemblages.
- Emphasizes need for consistent data collection protocols and timely data sharing, as well as considerations around metadata completeness to enable cross-study verification and reuse.
- External events (e.g., FMD-related access restrictions) can disrupt sampling; contingency plans and clear documentation of such impacts are essential for policy-relevant monitoring programs.
