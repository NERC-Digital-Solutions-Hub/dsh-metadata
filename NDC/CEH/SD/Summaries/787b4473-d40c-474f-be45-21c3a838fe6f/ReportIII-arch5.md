# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- A comprehensive field experiment on soil biodiversity at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide context for detailed studies and enable cross-year comparisons. Data cover weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition across multiple treatments.
- Significant site-management events in 2001: government restrictions due to Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) limiting site access; change of site officer.

## Data Collection and Metadata
- Site and design context
  - Location: Sourhope, Scottish Borders; long-running field experiment with baseline data from 1998.
  - Treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen (N), Lime (Lime), Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Biocide.
  - Management plan and baseline data survey referenced for context and comparability.
- Data types and measurements (1999–2001)
  - Automatic Weather Station: headline measures including rainfall, radiation, air and soil temperatures, soil moisture.
  - Above-ground biomass: measured across five mowing events per summer (May–Sept) with 0.5 m2 quadrats, dried weight summed annually; biomass used to compare treatments and year effects.
  - Soil pH: upper 5 cm measured periodically; baseline in August 1998; October 2001 measurements show lime and/or nitrogen effects on pH.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys in July 2001 (and in 2000 for comparison); identification and quantification of dominant species per plot using standardized protocols; 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in improved plots.
- Data collection procedures and quality controls
  - Field surveying conducted with defined sub-plots and blocks; observer checks showed no significant inter-surveyor differences in 2001 (NS result).
  - Data processing included ln-transformation of biomass for ANOVA, PCA for species assemblage analysis, and normalization of treatment effects against a reference plot (C1).
- Data governance and accessibility
  - Weather data regularly downloaded and transmitted to the Data Manager at CEH, Merlewood.
  - Data management and site personnel changes noted (affecting sampling logistics and protocol adherence).
  - Documentation and alignment with earlier reports (Baseline Data Survey, Report II) to aid cross-year comparability.

## Key Results and Insights
- Weather and site context (2001)
  - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar; slight cooling and increased soil moisture relative to prior years.
- Above-ground biomass
  - Consistent treatment hierarchy in biomass across the sampling period; peak biomass in July/August.
  - 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to staff changes and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N and/or L) generally increased biomass; N&L had strong positive effects.
  - ANOVA on log-transformed biomass showed significant differences between improved (N, L, or N&L) vs. non-improved plots; year-treatment interaction significant; blocks not significant.
- Soil pH
  - Lime addition raised soil pH substantially; N alone raised pH too, but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed little change since 1998 baseline.
- Botanical composition
  - Plant community differences aligned with treatments; Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis more abundant in improved plots; Agrostis capillaris declined with treatment across years.
  - Greater overall species presence (more hits) in 2001 vs 2000, indicating denser swards possibly due to excreting management changes and reduced grazing since 1998.
  - PCA indicated clear separation of improved vs unimproved plots; unimproved plots associated with bryophytes and Nardus stricta; improved plots clustered with Festuca rubra and related grasses.
  - Correlations between species abundance and biomass: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta negatively correlated as biomass increased.
  - Increased litter incidence in N and/or Lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
- Site heterogeneity
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site, with columns E and F showing more acidic plots; boundary effects potentially driven by treatment mix within columns.
  - Biomass variation across plots showed central plots tending to have higher biomass; positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No significant difference in biomass between experimental blocks, reinforcing a strong treatment-driven effect alongside spatial heterogeneity.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Transparency
- Methodological changes and their impact
  - 2001 shift to mechanical cutting likely influenced biomass estimates; normalization against C1 used to mitigate this.
  - Change in site officer and FMD-related access restrictions affected sampling schedule and data collection continuity.
- Data processing and reproducibility
  - Use of Genstat 5 for ANOVA and PCA; transparent statistical treatment (ln-transformation, interaction terms).
  - Inter-observer reliability demonstrated for botanical surveys in 2001.
  - Baseline and year-to-year comparability supported by alignment to Baseline Data Survey and Report II protocols.

## Implications for Data Stewardship
- Provenance and documentation
  - Maintain clear metadata linking Tables, Figures, and Appendices to measurement dates, field plots, and treatment codes.
  - Document procedural changes (e.g., mowing method, observer roles, and any equipment transitions) and their potential effects on data comparability.
- Data management and governance
  - Preserve a centralized data repository with versioning, including weather, biomass, pH, and botanical data, plus associated protocols and site management plans.
  - Ensure cross-year harmonization by keeping consistent measurement schemas, units, and coding for treatments and species names.
- Data quality and accessibility
  - Capture and store site heterogeneity indicators (e.g., plot position, column A–Z, slope orientation) to support spatial analyses.
  - Provide clear data dictionaries and a data management plan to support future re-analysis, replication, or integration with other projects.
- Recommendations for ongoing and future stewardship
  - Maintain detailed change logs for personnel, equipment, and sampling protocols.
  - Continue centralized data ingestion with checks for completeness (e.g., missing mowing events), timeliness (weather data downloads), and consistency (pH measurement methods).
  - Facilitate data sharing with standardized formats and comprehensive metadata to enable reuse by other researchers and data managers.
