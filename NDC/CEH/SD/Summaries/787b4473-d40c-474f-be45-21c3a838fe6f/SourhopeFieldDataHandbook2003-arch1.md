## Data handling, quality, and accessibility (Analysts’ perspective)

- The data are organized to support cross-cutting analyses of soil chemistry, texture-influenced horizons, and vegetation responses.
- Key variables enabling correlation and modelling:
  - Horizon-level chemistry: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, LOI, %Moisture loss, pH H2O, pH CaCl2
  - Physical descriptors: horizon names, depth ranges, colour notes, structure, root presence, stone content
  - Vegetation data: species counts and associations by plot/subplot, enabling linkages to soil gradients
  - Auger samples provide finer spatial resolution within blocks for local variation assessment
- Data quality and gaps:
  - Some Na data are missing in several horizons; variability across blocks and horizons indicates micro-scale heterogeneity
  - Multi-dataset integration (profiles, augers, vegetation, ecotron) requires careful provenance, cleaning, and standardization
  - Long-term data management includes metadata-rich archiving and making datasets discoverable via portals
- Analytical opportunities for the Analyst archetype:
  - Depth-resolved modelling of C, N, and LOI relationships with pH and base cations
  - Correlations between soil chemical patterns (e.g., Ca/Mg with pH, LOI with C) and vegetation composition or indicator species
  - Cross-block comparisons (Block 4 vs Block 5) to identify scale- or site-specific soil-vegetation dynamics
  - Temporal and spatial analyses leveraging ECOTRON plots for controlled perturbation scenarios and their effect on soil-vegetation linkages
