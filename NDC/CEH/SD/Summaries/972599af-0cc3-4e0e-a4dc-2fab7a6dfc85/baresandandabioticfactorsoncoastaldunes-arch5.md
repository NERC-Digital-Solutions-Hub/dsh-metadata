# Bare sand data collection and wind modeling in coastal dunes

## Purpose and scope
- Statistically test relationships between bare sand and three abiotic factors: wind speed, dune slope, and dune slope aspect.
- Produce dataset describing bare sand cover and associated topographic and wind metrics for coastal dunes.
- Data generated by Dr Thomas Smyth; intended for sharing and reuse with appropriate data governance.

## Data sources and collection periods
- Sites and imagery/DTMs:
  - Aberffraw: aerial imagery April 2015; DTM 2015; LiDAR from NRW Historic LiDAR Archive; imagery via EDINA Aerial Digimap.
  - Ainsdale: aerial imagery April 2015; DTM 2016; England LiDAR DTM 2016; imagery via EDINA Aerial Digimap.
  - Morfa Dyffryn: aerial imagery July 2014; DTM 2015; NRW LiDAR; imagery via EDINA Aerial Digimap.
  - Penhale: aerial imagery May 2016; DTM 2017; England LiDAR DTM 2017; imagery via EDINA Aerial Digimap.
- Data types:
  - High-resolution 25 cm vertical aerial imagery.
  - Digital terrain models (DTMs) from national LiDAR archives.
- Spatial and temporal alignment:
  - Imagery within 1 year of corresponding DTMs; cloud-free where used for bare-sand mapping.

## Data generation and processing
- Bare sand classification:
  - Method: semi-automatic classification in QGIS using the Semi-automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) with a minimum-distance classifier.
  - Training: 60 ROIs total (30 vegetation, 30 bare sand), covering color variability; pixel resolution 0.25 m; imagery from spring/summer.
  - Repeats: bare-sand mapping repeated three times per site due to known variability in coast dune environments.
  - Output: for each site, bare sand data reported as percent bare sand per 2.5 m2 area.
- Topography and orientation:
  - Aspect: calculated from LiDAR in QGIS; averaged over 2.5 m2 area.
  - Slope: calculated from LiDAR in QGIS; averaged over 2.5 m2 area.
- Wind speed modeling:
  - CFD modeling with OpenFOAM; turbulence modeled using RNG k-ε; SIMPLE algorithm for time-averaged solution.
  - Boundary conditions and turbulence model chosen to align with prior coastal dune studies.
  - Wind data: incident wind from the closest appropriate meteorological station for the 10 years prior to each site’s image date; wind speed at 0.4 m above the surface used for simulations.
  - Derived metrics: vertical profiles of velocity (U), turbulent kinetic energy (k), and dissipation rate (ε) using standard equations; shear velocity calculated with prescribed surface roughness z0 = 0.175 m (based on vegetated coastal dune studies).
- Computational domain and setup:
  - Domain prepared from airborne LiDAR (2014–2017); mesh refined from 40 × 40 × 40 m at top to 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5 m at surface.
  - Inlet at least 100 m upwind; domain height at least five times the highest topographic point.
  - Wind data sampled at 0.4 m above surface; convergence when velocity residuals reach 1e-4.
- Data provenance and references:
  - Method and context grounded in prior work (Delgado-Fernandez et al. 2018; Smyth et al. 2013, 2015, 2022; others cited in data description).

## Data structure and metadata
- File organization:
  - Each dataset saved as a CSV file prefixed by the location name (Aberffraw, Ainsdale, Morfa Dyffryn, Penhale).
- Data columns (examples described in the dataset documentation):
  - X coordinate (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid)
  - Y coordinate (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid)
  - Aspect (compass direction of dune slope, averaged over 2.5 m2)
  - Slope (angle of inclination, averaged over 2.5 m2)
  - Modelling wind speed at 0.4 m above surface (m s-1)
  - Percentage of 2.5 m2 area classified as bare sand (three iterations)
- File content purpose:
  - Enables spatially explicit analysis of bare sand in relation to wind and dune geometry.

## Data provenance and credits
- Generated by Dr Thomas Smyth.
- Cited data sources and methods align with a broader body of coastal dune research (citations provided in the dataset documentation).

## Reuse, sharing, and governance
- Intended for sharing with metadata and documentation to support discovery and reuse.
- Data files are named by location to facilitate cataloging and cross-site comparisons.
- Governance considerations (in line with Data Stewards role):
  - Metadata should document data sources (imagery dates, DTMs), processing steps (SCP method, ROI counts, iterations), software (QGIS, OpenFOAM), and model parameters (z0, turbulence model, domain size).
  - Clear notes on data limitations and variability in bare-sand classification accuracy (e.g., 82% agreement reported in related work) to inform users.
  - Plan to upload to relevant data portals and catalogue holdings with versioning and attribution to Dr. Smyth.

## Key challenges and considerations for data stewardship
- Managing incomplete or evolving user needs for dune data and related abiotic factors.
- Ensuring timely ingestion of multi-source data (LiDAR, aerial imagery, meteorological records) across sites.
- Achieving consistent metadata across diverse formats and systems (LiDAR, imagery, CFD outputs).
- Handling large, high-resolution datasets and complex CFD results; ensuring interoperability and scalable storage.
- Dealing with older or legacy datasets requiring bespoke processing (e.g., non-interoperable formats, varied coordinate systems).

## Summary of the document’s end goal
- Provide a reproducible, spatially explicit dataset linking bare sand coverage to wind conditions and dune geometry, enabling analysis of how abiotic factors influence dune bare-sand dynamics across multiple coastal sites.
