# Bare sand data

## Overview
- Data collection aims to statistically test the relationship between bare sand and three abiotic factors on coastal dunes: wind speed, dune slope, and dune slope aspect.
- Generated datasets enable standardized environmental monitoring and potential integration with other datasets.

## Data sources and collection timeline
- Aerial imagery and digital terrain models (DTMs) used to classify bare sand and compute terrain metrics:
  - Aberffraw: Aerial imagery April 2015; DTM 2015 (NRW Historic LiDAR).
  - Ainsdale: Aerial imagery April 2015; DTM 2016 (England LiDAR England).
  - Morfa Dyffryn: Aerial imagery July 2014; DTM 2015 (NRW Historic LiDAR).
  - Penhale: Aerial imagery May 2016; DTM 2017 (England LiDAR England).
- Imagery resolution: 25 cm high-resolution vertical aerial imagery; coverage tiles specified per site.
- All imagery cloud-free and captured within 1 year of the corresponding DTM.

## Generation method and data processing
- Bare sand mapping
  - Semi-automatic classification in QGIS using the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) with a minimum distance classifier.
  - Training: 60 ROIs total (30 vegetation, 30 bare sand); training polygons selected to cover color variation and were similar in size.
  - Pixel resolution: 0.25 m; classification performed for each site and repeated three times to account for variability in bare sand mapping in dunes.
  - Output: percentage of bare sand per 2.5 m2 area for each iteration; data stored in CSV files.
- Derived terrain metrics
  - Aspect and slope computed from LiDAR (DTM) data over the same 2.5 m2 analysis area.
  - Wind speed modeled at 0.4 m above the surface using CFD (OpenFOAM) with a SIMPLE scheme and RNG k-ε turbulence model.
  - CFD setup: domain refined from 40×40×40 m at the top to 2.5×2.5×2.5 m at the surface; domain upwind distance at least 100 m; height at least 5× the tallest dune feature.
  - Wind forcing: incident wind from the nearest meteorological station for the 10 preceding years (averaged for speeds > 6 m/s); wind direction and speed summarized per site.
  - Reference equations used to generate vertical profiles: U(z), k(z), ε(z) with prescribed roughness length z0 = 0.175 m.

## Wind data and domain specifics
- Meteorological inputs
  - Ainsdale: Crosby station, wind direction 252°, wind speed 9.22 m/s (SSE direction from site).
  - Aberffraw: Valley station, wind direction 214°, wind speed 9.48 m/s (NW from site).
  - Morfa Dyffryn: Valley station, wind direction 214°, wind speed 9.48 m/s.
  - Penhale: Culdrose station, wind direction 236°, wind speed 8.76 m/s (S from site).
- Modeling details
  - Wind data sampled 0.4 m above the surface; residual convergence criteria set to 10^-4.
  - Domain and grid: gradually decreasing cell size from 40 m to 2.5 m toward the surface; inlet positioned upwind; domain height sufficient to capture topographic effects.

## Data structure and units
- File format: CSV, with each dataset prefixed by location name.
- Columns (per point centroid in a 2.5 m2 area):
  - X coordinate (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid)
  - Y coordinate (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid)
  - Aspect (compass direction the slope faces, averaged over 2.5 m2)
  - Slope (angle of inclination, averaged over 2.5 m2)
  - Modelling wind speed at 0.4 m above surface (m/s)
  - Percentage of 2.5 m2 area classified as bare sand (iteration 1)
  - Percentage of 2.5 m2 area classified as bare sand (iteration 2)
  - Percentage of 2.5 m2 area classified as bare sand (iteration 3)

## Study authors and file structure
- Data generated by Dr. Thomas Smyth.
- Each dataset stored as a location-prefixed CSV file for ease of integration and reproducibility.

## Purpose and usage
- Facilitates statistical analysis of the relationship between bare sand cover and abiotic factors (wind speed, dune slope, and dune slope aspect).
- Supports monitoring and reporting within environmental monitoring programs; data can be integrated with other environmental datasets and uploaded to appropriate portals.

## Quality, replication, and supporting references
- Bare sand mapping variability acknowledged; three iterations address repeatability.
- Training and validation align with prior work on remote sensing classification accuracy (noted 82% agreement between ground truth and remote sensing in dune environments).
- Key methodological references underpinning CFD, classification, and dune dynamics are cited for traceability and reproducibility.
