# Extent, accuracy and repeatability of bare sand and vegetation cover in dunes mapped from aerial imagery is highly variable

- Purpose and scope
  - Statistically test the relationship between bare sand and three abiotic factors on coastal dunes: wind speed, dune slope, and dune slope aspect.
  - Data generated by Dr Thomas Smyth to support analysis of bare-sand mapping accuracy and variability.

- Study sites and data collection
  - Locations: Aberffraw, Ainsdale, Morfa Dyffryn, Penhale.
  - Data types collected for each site:
    - Aerial imagery (high-resolution, 25 cm, spring/summer, cloud-free; imagery year aligned within 1 year of LiDAR data).
    - Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from LiDAR (National resources/Lidar England datasets; multiple years 2014–2017 depending on site).
  - Data purpose: derive bare sand areas, dune aspect, and slope; wind modelling input.

- Bare sand mapping (generation method)
  - Method: semi-automatic classification (SCP) in QGIS with minimum distance algorithm.
  - Training: 60 Regions of Interest (ROIs) total (30 vegetation, 30 bare sand), representative colors, roughly equal ROI size.
  - Resolution: aerial imagery at 0.25 m per pixel.
  - Repetition: bare-sand classification repeated three times per site due to variability in mapping.
  - Output: CSV files with percent bare sand per 2.5 m by 2.5 m area.

- Derived topographic and wind-related variables
  - Aspect: computed from LiDAR in QGIS; reported as compass direction of the slope face, averaged over 2.5 m^2.
  - Slope: computed from LiDAR; reported as average inclination angle over 2.5 m^2.
  - Wind speed: modelled at 0.4 m above the dune surface using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in OpenFOAM; based on:
    - Naïve CFD approach (RANS, SIMPLE) with RNG k-ε turbulence model.
    - Inlet wind conditions derived from the average of above-threshold (>6 m/s) winds over the 10 years preceding the imagery, from the nearest meteorological station.
    - Domain and mesh: top of domain 40 m, tapering to 2.5 m at the surface; domain upwind from region of interest by at least 100 m; domain height at least five times the highest topographic point.
    - Surface roughness z0 = 0.175 m (consistent with prior work).
  - Wind data details: shear velocity and vertical profiles (U(z)), turbulent kinetic energy k(z), and dissipation rate ε(z) calculated using standard relationships; specific site wind speed values (direction and speed) are listed per site.

- Data structure and contents
  - For each site, datasets are CSV files prefixed by location.
  - Columns include:
    - X coordinate (2.5 m^2 area centroid in OSGB grid)
    - Y coordinate (2.5 m^2 area centroid in OSGB grid)
    - Aspect (direction, averaged over 2.5 m^2)
    - Slope (angle, averaged over 2.5 m^2)
    - Modelling wind speed at 0.4 m above surface (m/s)
    - Bare-sand percentage (iteration 1)
    - Bare-sand percentage (iteration 2)
    - Bare-sand percentage (iteration 3)

  - Ainsdale: Crosby meteorological station; wind direction 252°; wind speed 9.22 m/s
  - Aberffraw: Valley station; wind direction 214°; wind speed 9.48 m/s
  - Morfa Dyffryn: Valley station; wind direction 214°; wind speed 9.48 m/s
  - Penhale: Culdrose station; wind direction 236°; wind speed 8.76 m/s

- Modelling and references
  - CFD modelling details:
    - OpenFOAM; SIMPLE algorithm; time-averaged solution; RNG k-ε turbulence model.
    - Literature basis for boundary conditions, turbulence modelling, and validation (e.g., Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes, wind engineering practices).
  - Data generation references:
    - Semi-automatic classification plugin (SCP) documentation.
    - Prior studies on dune dynamics, wind flow over dunes, and surface roughness estimation.

- Context, rationale and limitations
  - Data collection and analysis were designed to quantify how bare sand presence relates to wind speed, dune slope, and dune aspect, acknowledging known variability in bare-sand detection from aerial imagery.
  - The methodology includes multiple iterations of bare-sand mapping to assess repeatability and to document variability in classification outcomes.
  - The title implies high variability in extent, accuracy, and repeatability of bare sand and vegetation mapping from aerial imagery, which the methods aim to characterize across sites.
