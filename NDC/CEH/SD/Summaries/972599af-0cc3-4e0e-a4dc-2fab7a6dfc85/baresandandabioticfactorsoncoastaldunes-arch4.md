# Bare sand data was classified from the aerial imagery in Table 1. Aspect and slope were calculated from the digital terrain models listed in Table 1. Wind speed was calculated 0.4 m above the digital terrain models listed in Table 1.

## Overview
- Describes how bare sand and dune topography were quantified across four coastal sites using aerial imagery, LiDAR-derived terrain models, and wind modeling.
- Aims to test relationships between bare sand cover and abiotic factors: wind speed, dune slope, and slope aspect.
- Data are produced as location-specific CSV files with standardized columns for downstream analysis.

## Data sources and study sites
- Locations and imagery/DTM data:
  - Aberffraw: Aerial imagery April 2015; DTM 2015 (Natural Resources Wales Historic LiDAR Archive); high-resolution imagery 2015; LiDAR-derived products via EDINA Aerial Digimap.
  - Ainsdale: Aerial imagery April 2015; DTM 2016 (England LiDAR); imagery 2015; LiDAR-derived products via EDINA Aerial Digimap.
  - Morfa Dyffryn: Aerial imagery July 2014; DTM 2015 (NRW Historic LiDAR); imagery 2014; LiDAR-derived products via EDINA Aerial Digimap.
  - Penhale: Aerial imagery May 2016; DTM 2017 (England LiDAR); imagery 2015; LiDAR-derived products via EDINA Aerial Digimap.
- Data collection period referenced in Table 1 (imagery and DTM years aligned to ensure ≤1 year between image and terrain model).

## Generation methods (bare sand and topography)
- Bare sand mapping:
  - Performed in QGIS using Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) with a minimum distance algorithm on true-color RGB imagery.
  - Training: 60 regions of interest (ROIs) total, 30 vegetation and 30 bare sand; ROIs chosen to cover color variation and roughly equal size.
  - Image resolution: 0.25 m, cloud-free, spring/summer acquisitions; each site’s imagery within 1 year of its DTM.
  - Bare sand mapping repeated three times per site due to variability in mapping outcomes; results reported as percent bare sand per 2.5 m x 2.5 m area.
- Topography (aspect and slope):
  - Calculated in QGIS from LiDAR-derived DTMs.
  - Values averaged over a 2.5 m x 2.5 m area.
- Wind speed modeling:
  - CFD modeling with OpenFOAM to estimate wind speed at 0.4 m above surface.
  - Domain: top boundary domain 40 m x 40 m x 40 m tapering to 2.5 m resolution at surface; upwind inlet at least 100 m from analysis region; domain height at least five times the highest topographic point.
  - Mesh: gradually refined from 40 m down to 2.5 m at surface.
  - Turbulence and solver: RNG k-ε turbulence model; SIMPLE pressure-velocity coupling; Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations.
  - Boundary conditions and z0:
    - Uniform surface roughness length z0 = 0.175 m (based on Ammophila arenaria vegetated slack).
  - Wind input:
    - Incident wind conditions derived from meteorological stations for the 10 years prior to image capture; average wind speed and direction above threshold winds (>6 m/s) used to drive simulations.
    - Stations: Crosby (Ainsdale, near-site), Valley (Aberffraw and Morfa Dyffryn), Culdrose (Penhale).
    - 10-year averages provide wind speed, direction, and shear velocity (u*), used to compute vertical profiles (U(z)), turbulence kinetic energy (k(z)), and dissipation rate (ε(z)).
  - Numerical outputs reported at 0.4 m above the surface.

## Data structure and contents
- File structure:
  - Each dataset saved as a CSV file prefixed by the location name.
- Columns and units (per dataset):
  - X coordinate of 2.5 m2 area centroid (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid)
  - Y coordinate of 2.5 m2 area centroid (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid)
  - Aspect (compass direction the slope faces, averaged over 2.5 m2)
  - Slope (angle of inclination, averaged over 2.5 m2)
  - Modelling wind speed 0.4 m above the surface (m/s)
  - Percentage of 2.5 m2 area classified as sand (iteration 1)
  - Percentage of 2.5 m2 area classified as sand (iteration 2)
  - Percentage of 2.5 m2 area classified as sand (iteration 3)

## Purpose and intended use
- To statistically test relationships between bare sand cover and three abiotic factors: wind speed, dune slope, and slope aspect.
- Data are suitable for analyses examining how physical dune properties influence sand cover dynamics.

## Data governance and provenance
- Generated by Dr Thomas Smyth.
- Documentation includes references to established methods and prior work on labelling/classification accuracy, CFD modeling, and dune dynamics.
- Iterative bare sand classifications address reproducibility concerns highlighted in prior studies.

## Limitations and considerations
- Bare sand mapping variability necessitated three mapping iterations per site, indicating sensitivity to classification approach.
- Data rely on time-aligned imagery and DTMs; differences in acquisition timing could affect comparability.
- Wind modeling depends on historical wind data and chosen turbulence model; results are contingent on boundary conditions and z0 selection.
