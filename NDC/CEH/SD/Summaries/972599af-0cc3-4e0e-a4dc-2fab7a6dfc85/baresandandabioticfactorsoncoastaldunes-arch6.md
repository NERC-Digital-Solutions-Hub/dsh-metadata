# Bare Sand data across coastal dunes

- Objective
  - Statistically test the relationship between bare sand and three abiotic factors (wind speed, dune slope, and dune slope aspect) across coastal dune sites.
- Study sites and data sources
  - Aberffraw, Ainsdale, Morfa Dyffryn, Penhale.
  - Aerial imagery: high-resolution 25 cm vertical imagery (2014–2016, depending on site).
  - Digital terrain models (DTMs) from England LiDAR or NRW Historic LiDAR Archive (dates 2014–2017).
  - Imagery and LiDAR references and access via EDINA Aerial Digimap Service.
- Data generation and classification
  - Bare sand mapped in QGIS using the Semi-automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) with a minimum distance algorithm on true-color RGB images.
  - Training: 60 ROIs total (30 vegetation, 30 bare sand) to cover colour variation; each site analyzed at 0.25 m pixel resolution.
  - Bare sand mapping repeated three times per site to account for method variability; outputs are percentages of bare sand per 2.5 m2 area.
- Derived topographic and environmental variables
  - Aspect: compass direction of dune surface within a 2.5 m2 area, calculated from LiDAR in QGIS.
  - Slope: angle of inclination within a 2.5 m2 area, calculated from LiDAR in QGIS.
  - Wind speed: modeled at 0.4 m above the surface using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with OpenFOAM; turbulence modeled with RNG k-ε; inlet conditions based on historical wind data from nearby meteorological stations.
- Wind data and modeling details
  - Incident wind conditions sourced from the closest appropriate meteorological station for the 10 years preceding image acquisition (Table 2 data per site).
  - CFD domain: topography generated from airborne LiDAR; domain resolutions taper from 40 × 40 × 40 m at the top to 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5 m at the surface.
  - Domain setup: inlet at least 100 m upwind; domain height at least 5× the highest topographic point; sampling height 0.4 m; simulations run until velocity residuals reach 1e-4.
  - Output variables include velocity (U), shear velocity (u*), turbulent kinetic energy (k), and dissipation rate (ε) profiles.
- Data structure and formats
  - Each dataset is stored as a CSV file prefixed by location name.
  - Columns include: X (eastings), Y (northings) in OSGB (British National Grid); Aspect; Slope; Modelling wind speed at 0.4 m; Bare sand percentages (three iterations).
- Purpose of data collection
  - To quantify relationships between bare sand cover and abiotic factors (wind speed, slope, and slope aspect) on coastal dunes.
- Data provenance and contributors
  - Generated by Dr. Thomas Smyth.
- File structure and access
  - CSV files are organized per location, enabling cross-site comparisons and self-service data exploration for end users.
- References and methodological basis
  - CFD and boundary conditions references (Blocken et al.; Delgado-Fernandez et al.; Smyth et al.; Levin et al.; Mather & Tso; Richards & Hoxey) informing wind modeling, classification methods, and dune dynamics.
