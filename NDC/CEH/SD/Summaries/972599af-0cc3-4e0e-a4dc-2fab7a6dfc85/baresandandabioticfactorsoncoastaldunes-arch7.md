# Bare Sand data classification and wind modelling for coastal dunes

## Overview
- Four study sites (Aberffraw, Ainsdale, Morfa Dyffryn, Penhale) with integrated bare sand, aspect, slope, and wind data derived from aerial imagery, LiDAR-based DTMs, and CFD modelling.
- Primary aim: statistically test relationships between bare sand and wind speed, dune slope, and slope aspect.
- Data produced by Dr Thomas Smyth; datasets saved as location-prefixed CSV files.

## Data sources and collection dates
- Aerial imagery and DTMs per site:
  - Aberffraw: Aerial April 2015; DTM 2015.
  - Ainsdale: Aerial April 2015; DTM 2016.
  - Morfa Dyffryn: Aerial July 2014; DTM 2015.
  - Penhale: Aerial May 2016; DTM 2017.
- LiDAR-based DTMs from established archives; high-resolution imagery at 25 cm resolution.
- Wind data: incident wind conditions from the closest/most appropriate meteorological station for the 10 years preceding image capture; speeds around 8.76–9.48 m/s and directions roughly 214°–252°.

## Bare sand mapping and classification (GIS workflow)
- Software: QGIS with Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP).
- Classification method: minimum distance algorithm on true-color RGB images.
- Training: 60 ROIs total (30 vegetation, 30 bare sand); training polygons cover the color range of each class.
- Imagery: 0.25 m pixel resolution, cloud-free, captured in spring/summer; imagery dated within 1 year of the associated DTM.
- Repetition: bare sand classification repeated three times per site due to observed variability.
- Output: for each site, a CSV file with percent bare sand per 2.5 m^2 area.

## Derived geographic and environmental variables
- Aspect: dune-surface aspect calculated from LiDAR; reported as the average compass direction over a 2.5 m^2 area.
- Slope: dune-surface slope calculated from LiDAR; reported as the average angle over a 2.5 m^2 area.
- Wind speed (CFD): wind speed at 0.4 m above the surface simulated with OpenFOAM using:
  - Turbulence model: RNG k-ε; turbulence and boundary conditions aligned with prior studies.
  - Solver: SIMPLE; time-averaged (RANS) solution.
  - Domain: top 40×40×40 m, tapering to 2.5×2.5×2.5 m near surface; upwind inlet at least 100 m from the study area; domain height ≥ 5× tallest topographic point.
  - Roughness length z0: 0.175 m (uniform).
  - Calculation height: 0.4 m above surface.
  - Output: modulated wind speed values and related flow metrics at the 2.5 m^2 area centroids.
- Data alignment: coordinates provided as X and Y (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid) for each 2.5 m^2 area.

## Data structure and units
- Columns in the dataset:
  - X: centroid X coordinate (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid).
  - Y: centroid Y coordinate (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid).
  - Aspect: average compass direction of slope (degrees).
  - Slope: average inclination (degrees).
  - Modelling wind speed 0.4 m above surface (m/s).
  - Bare sand, iteration 1 (%).
  - Bare sand, iteration 2 (%).
  - Bare sand, iteration 3 (%).

## File structure and access
- Each dataset is stored as a CSV file prefixed by the location name ( Aberffraw, Ainsdale, Morfa Dyffryn, Penhale ).

## Why and who
- Purpose: to test relationships between bare sand cover and abiotic physical factors (wind speed, slope, slope aspect) for coastal dunes.
- Data generated by: Dr Thomas Smyth.
