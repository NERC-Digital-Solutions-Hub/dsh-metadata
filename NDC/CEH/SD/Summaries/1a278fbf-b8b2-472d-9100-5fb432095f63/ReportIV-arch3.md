# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Purpose: Report on four years of monitoring at Sourhope to assess how mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide treatments affect above-ground productivity, plant diversity, and community function, with implications for environmental health monitoring and policy decisions.

- Site and design:
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient.
  - Each block contains 6 main plots; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m2 cells used for data collection.
  - Five annual management tasks since 1999: monthly mowing to ≈6 cm; insecticide application after mowing; nitrogen and/or lime fertilisation; combinations of N and lime; controls without treatment.
  - Treatments include Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (formerly Biocide).

- Key measuring approaches (data and methods):
  - Above-ground biomass: regular harvests from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells, dry-weighted to track productivity (May–Sept, five cuts per summer).
  - Plant diversity and composition: point analysis surveys (0.5 m2 cell with 100-point grid) conducted baseline (1998) and repeatedly in 2000–2002; bryophyte identification expanded in 2002.
  - Functional groups: plants categorized into stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress ruderals (CSR), and SR/CSR; tracking shifts over time and treatments.
  - Soil and climate context: soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture; on-site Automatic Weather Station for rainfall, radiation, and temperature data.
  - Data handling: extensive Appendices with species lists, biomass time series, and PCA/ANOVA results; cross-project data coordination and governance considerations discussed.

- Major findings by management driver:
  - Mowing effect
    - Consistent decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across treatments; broad site-level response not tied to a single treatment.
    - Festuca rubra expands, especially in fertilised plots; bryophytes (mosses) increase with maintained sward height (~6 cm) and reduced grazing.
    - Overall plant productivity is influenced more by disturbance regime (loss of grazing) and fertilisation status than by mowing alone; moss expansion linked to mo dulating disturbance and nutrient status.
  - Fertilisation effect (nitrogen and/or lime)
    - Clear positive impact on above-ground biomass; plots receiving both nitrogen and lime show the strongest productivity gains.
    - Lime raises soil pH toward 7.0 in treated plots; very high lime rates may influence moisture and stress plant growth at times.
    - Nutrient enrichment supports a functional shift from stress-tolerators toward more competitive taxa; higher pH interacts with moisture to shape productivity.
  - Insecticide effect
    - Shannon diversity tends to be higher in insecticide-treated plots, with possible links to reduced herbivory enabling more palatable species; however, causal attribution is cautious due to limited herbivore data.
    - Results align with literature suggesting herbivory can influence diversity; effects appear context-dependent and not uniformly strong across all plots.
  - Trampling effect (noted in C2 plots)
    - 2002 biomass declines in C2 plots likely due to trampling during intensive sampling and 13CO2 pulse experiments, rather than a treatment effect per se.

- Biodiversity and functional community dynamics:
  - Dominant functional groups (S, CSR, SR/CSR) accounted for the majority of species hits; by 2002, nitrogen and lime plots show strong CSR/SR dominance while unimproved plots favor stress-tolerators.
  - Bryophytes increase across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; mosses contribute a growing share of total hits and biomass in several years.
  - Point Analysis and PCA reveal clear separation between improved (fertilised/limed) and unimproved plots; limed plots cluster distinctly, with nitrogen-treated plots showing overlaps with limed and control/insecticide-treated plots.
  - Litter and dead-vegetation hits show treatment-related differences emerging after 2000, with higher litter in some treated plots.
  - Shannon diversity declines in some fertilised plots relative to baseline, while increases occur in others, indicating nuanced responses by year and treatment.

- Data quality, gaps, and governance considerations:
  - 2002 weather data had gaps due to a station malfunction; some missing July–August and October–November data were substituted from an external station, with caveats.
  - Large data sets: thousands of soil samples (totaling over 11,600 by 2002) and extensive botanical, biomass, and bryophyte data; multiple projects (Phase I and II) contributing data.
  - Governance and accessibility: the programme highlights the need for metadata clarity, data standardisation, open sharing of underlying data, and robust data management to enable cross-project evaluation and policy use.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy decisions:
  - Design implications: randomized block, replicated layout with predefined mowing and treatment schedules enables attribution of ecological responses to specific management actions.
  - Metrics to inform policy:
    - Productivity: above-ground biomass as a functional proxy for ecosystem output under different management actions.
    - Biodiversity: Shannon index and species composition to detect shifts in community structure and resilience.
    - Functional traits: tracking S, CSR, SR/CSR groups to infer potential changes in ecosystem processes and stability.
    - Soil context: soil pH and moisture as key drivers of productivity and community composition.
  - Management insights:
    - Nutrient management (N and lime) strongly boosts productivity but can shift communities toward competitive types and alter moisture/pH balance; careful rate management is advised.
    - Regular mowing reduces certain grasses and promotes bryophytes; disturbance regime interacts with nutrient status to shape diversity and function.
    - Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but require more direct data on herbivory to inform policy about non-target biodiversity outcomes.
  - Data governance takeaway: for monitoring frameworks linked to policy, ensure standardized data collection, transparent metadata, and public sharing of underlying data to support reproducible assessments and cross-site synthesis.

- Overall takeaway for monitoring frameworks:
  - A multi-faceted monitoring approach—combining productivity metrics, detailed species and functional-group data, and soil/climate context—provides robust insight into how management actions influence ecological health.
  - Clear documentation of sampling design, treatment schedules, and data handling is essential to translate ecological findings into actionable policy guidance and to enable future decision-making under changing environmental conditions.
