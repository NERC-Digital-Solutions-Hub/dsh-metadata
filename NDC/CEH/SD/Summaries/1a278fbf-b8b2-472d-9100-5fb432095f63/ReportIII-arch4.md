# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Large field experiment on soil biodiversity at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, conducted under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme. Baseline data survey from 1998 described site rationale, design, methods and management. The report presents monitoring data to contextualize groups’ detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.

- Management and context for 2001
  - Government restrictions due to Foot and Mouth Disease limited site access Feb–May 2001; work was reorganised under an agreed timetable with vet oversight.
  - One site management officer change occurred in 2001 (post May).

- Data collection framework and documentation
  - Monitoring covered a range of measurements with timing summarized in Table 1 (1999–2001 window).
  - Automatic Weather Station data were collected on site and regularly transmitted to the CEH Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
  - Above-ground productivity measured across plots with repeated summer cuts; biomass weights were collected and analyzed.
  - Soil pH measured at shallow depth (0–5 cm), with liming and nitrogen treatments affecting pH.
  - Botanical composition monitored via Point Quadrat surveys and species hits, with species trends tracked across treatments.
  - Data analysis tools included Genstat 5 for ANOVA and PCA; appendix provides annual biomass and species data.

- Key results by data category
  - Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - Rainfall near long-term average; radiation largely unchanged; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture marginally higher than prior years.
  - Above-ground biomass (treatments 1999–2001)
    - Clear hierarchy of biomass among treatments; peak biomass in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 1999–2000, likely due to staff changes and switch from manual to mechanical mowing.
    - Nitrogen and/or lime additions increased biomass; N and lime combination (N&L) most effective.
    - ANOVA shows significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; year-treament interaction significant; blocks not significant.
  - Soil pH (0–5 cm)
    - Liming raised pH to about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in N&L plots by Oct 2001; nitrogen alone also raised pH but less so.
    - Control plots remained near baseline values since Aug 1998.
  - Botanical composition (Point Quadrat, 2001)
    - 58% more hits in 2001 than 2000; possible densification after grazing removal in 1998.
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased across treatments.
    - Improved plots (N and/or lime) showed increased abundances of Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis; unimproved plots showed more Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta.
    - 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential diversity loss with strong fertilization.
    - PCA separated improved vs unimproved plots; major species shifts linked to fertility and liming.
    - Biomass correlates: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass increased; litter increases with nitrogen and/or lime indicating faster turnover.
- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F tended to be more acidic than others, with lower pH in Nitrogen and/or Lime plots.
  - Biomass distribution showed central plots often higher in biomass; outlying plots had lower biomass across treatments.
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant difference in biomass across blocks.
- Implications for data governance and management (Data Leaders focus)
  - The study demonstrates the need for robust data lineage and metadata to handle method changes (e.g., switch from manual to mechanical mowing) and to maintain year-to-year comparability.
  - Importance of centralized data management: weather data already routed to a data manager; other data (biomass, pH, botanical surveys) are integrated with clear protocols and observer checks.
  - Standardized measurement protocols and documentation (e.g., Table 1, Appendix 1) facilitate cross-study and cross-year comparisons; inter-observer consistency was assessed and found non-significant in 2001.
  - Use of controlled vocabularies and species codes (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris; Fr = Festuca rubra; etc.) supports data discoverability and interoperability.
  - Data quality and transparency: significant treatment effects and year interactions require careful interpretation; the dataset includes detailed statistical outputs (ANOVA tables, PCA figures) to facilitate validation and reuse.
  - Challenges to data access and continuity: FMD restrictions highlighted the need for contingency planning and protocol-driven sampling during access limitations.
