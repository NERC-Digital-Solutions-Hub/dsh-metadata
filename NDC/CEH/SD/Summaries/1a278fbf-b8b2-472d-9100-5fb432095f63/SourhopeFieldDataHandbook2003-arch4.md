# Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003

## Overview
- Multi-block dataset from the Sourhope field site focusing on soil profiles, soil chemistry, and vegetation data.
- Blocks 4 and 5 (with ecotron component) provide horizon-level descriptions, laboratory analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys.
- Data are tightly linked to sampling design (plots, horizons, depths) and archived with associated metadata and specimen tracking; intended for long-term ecological monitoring and cross-site comparability.
- Some data gaps and early-standardization challenges noted (partial vegetation coverage, missing measurements in some horizons/plots).

## Data structure and content

- Block 4: Soil profile and analyses
  - Horizons described with depth ranges: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Descriptions emphasize fibrous, moist soils with varying mineral content, rooting, and stone content; boundary boundaries are noted (e.g., sharp smooth, sharp wavy).
  - Soil analyses per horizon include: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI), pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Example patterns: top horizons with high LOI and organic content; acidic pH values around 4.6–5.0; Ca and other bases variable by horizon; moisture loss generally in a mid-range, with higher LOI in surface horizons.

- Block 4 auger samples
  - Subsamples (A–F) with weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O and CaCl2.
  - Data show consistency in low to moderate nitrogen and carbon contents across horizons, with C:N ratios typically in the mid-teens; pH values in the acidic range; minor to moderate base cation variation by horizon.

- Block 4 vegetation survey
  - Plot- and subplot-level species tallies (e.g., 4A–4F), including totals for species groups and indicator species.
  - Data indicate diverse herb/grass communities with varying species counts per plot, informing associations with soil properties.

- Block 4 Ecotron soil site
  - Soil analysis: Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O and CaCl2.
  - Vegetation survey: presence/absence tallies and species totals across ecotron plots (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, P, etc.).

- Block 5: Site details, soil profile, auger samples, vegetation survey
  - Site details: grid reference NT8544019520, altitude 315 m, slope ~5°, imperfect drainage; soil subgroups identified as Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material includes undifferentiated igneous and andesite.
  - Block 5 soil profile: Horizons LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Analyses per horizon mirror Block 4 structure: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
  - Auger samples and vegetation data accompany horizon data for Block 5, with detailed per-sample values (A–F sub-samples) for chemical and physical properties and species totals per plot.

- Block 5 ecotronics and vegetation
  - ECOTRON PLOT data include soil chemistry and vegetation presence/absence/totals, consistent with Block 4 structure.
  - Block 5 vegetation surveys show per-plot species totals and distributions across Ac–P plots, with totals indicating varying community composition.

- Data management and metadata
  - Each dataset is linked to MLURI/CEH archiving, with barcode identifiers for individual samples and horizons.
  - Data are organized to support cross-plot and cross-block comparisons, and to facilitate long-term biodiversity and soil-plant interaction analyses.

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations
- Coverage limitations: vegetation sampling covers a subset of subplots, so results are indicative rather than exhaustive for each block.
- Temporal scope: baseline data concentrated in initial horizons and plots; long-term changes require ongoing sampling.
- Standardization challenges: horizon naming, units, and metadata consistency across blocks require careful harmonization for integrated analyses.
- Data gaps: some missing measurements in auger sub-samples and plots; fallow and certain horizons show incomplete data in places.

## Data management, accessibility, and use
- Centralized archiving of soil and vegetation data, with supporting metadata and Appendix datasets (e.g., soil and vegetation data by block, auger analyses, and ecotron datasets).
- Data products enable baseline soil-plant associations, biodiversity assessments, and long-term monitoring capabilities.
- The dataset supports reproducibility, cross-site comparison, and policy-relevant biodiversity and soil studies, with potential for networked data collaborations.

## Implications and recommendations for data leaders
- Leverage the horizon-level soil chemistry linked to plot-level vegetation data to develop robust soil-vegetation indicators and monitoring targets.
- Standardize metadata and data dictionaries across blocks (horizon codes, measurement units, analytical methods) to improve cross-site comparability.
- Ensure comprehensive data lineage and provenance, including sampling moments, lab methods, and archiving paths, to support reproducibility and governance.
- Address data gaps by prioritizing consistent vegetation sampling coverage and completing missing horizon measurements to enhance dataset completeness.

## Key data products and governance opportunities
- Cohesive, multi-layer dataset linking soil horizons, chemistry, and vegetation across blocks 4 and 5, plus Ecotron plots.
- Baseline datasets suitable for cross-site comparisons, data-led governance, and networked biodiversity research.
- Opportunities to formalize data standards (NVC/classifications alignment, horizon metadata), sampling moments documentation, and archiving protocols to support scalable collaborations.
