# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Large field experiment at Sourhope, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for more detailed studies; data for cross-year comparisons and linking with other projects.
  - Baseline established in 1998; monitoring spanned 1999–2001; results enable year-to-year and treatment-to-treatment comparisons.
  - 2001 management and data collection affected by external events: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May 2001) and a change of site Officer in Charge.
  - Primary monitoring outputs: Automatic Weather Station data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition (Point Analysis).

## Introduction

- Site and programme context
  - Intensive study at Sourhope farm (Scottish Borders) as part of the MLURI Soil Biodiversity Programme.
  - Initial broad monitoring plan aligned with other research groups to contextualise detailed studies.
  - 1998 Baseline Data Survey described site rationale, design, and management.
- Monitoring aims and outputs
  - Table 1 outlines measurement types and dates; data packaging facilitates linking with other datasets and year-to-year comparisons.
  - 2001 events influenced management activities but core monitoring continued as per the Site Management Plan.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable.
  - After a very wet year, 2001 rainfall closer to long-term average (839 mm).
  - Total radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower.
  - Average soil moisture content higher than in preceding years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Treatment hierarchy and seasonal timing
  - Across treatments, peak biomass consistently in July–August.
  - 2001 biomass estimates were substantially higher than in previous years.
  - Likely drivers: change in personnel and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Treatment effects and statistics
  - Biomass normalized against C1 showed persistent positive impacts of nitrogen and/or lime.
  - ANOVA on biomass (log-transformed) indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots and a significant Year × Treatment interaction; no significant blocks effect.
- Implications
  - Fertilisation and liming drive above-ground productivity; management changes can influence measurement intensity but the treatment signal persists.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime and nitrogen effects
  - Lime continued to raise surface soil pH (top 5 cm) to about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen + Lime plots by Oct 2001.
  - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed little change since baseline (Aug 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- Survey methodology and changes
  - July 2001 Point Analysis followed the 2000 protocol; inter-surveyor differences were not significant.
  - 2001 survey recorded 58% more hits than 2000, indicating increased sward density, possibly from reduced grazing since 1998.
- Species and community shifts
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 (except control-specific persistence in some plots).
  - Festuca species increased across treatments; Festuca rubra particularly associated with N and/or Lime plots; Festuca ovina more frequent in fertilised plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) showed more Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, and Holcus mollis; unimproved plots retained species typical of less fertile pastures (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
  - Diversity: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen + Lime plots, suggesting possible declines in diversity with fertility enhancement.
- Multivariate patterns and correlations
  - Principal Components Analysis largely separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Biomass positively correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; negative correlations with Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis.
  - Increased litter frequency in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
  - Biomass estimates across plots correlated with species composition, supporting links between nutrient status, species shifts, and productivity.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial patterning
  - Columns E and F (right-hand side, up-slope) showed more acidic plots, a pattern amplified by higher proportions of Control or Biocide plots in those columns.
  - Indicates underlying, persistent spatial heterogeneity in pH and associated plant communities across the site.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass distribution and its drivers
  - Outlying plots tended to have lower biomass; central plots tended to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
  - There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No significant differences in biomass between blocks (i.e., block effects were not detected).

## Management and Data Context (notes on field operations)

- 2001 operational adjustments
  - Foot and Mouth restrictions halted visitors Feb–May; activities conducted under an agreed protocol.
  - First biocide application in May 2001 was missed due to access limitations; subsequent applications completed.
  - Officer in Charge changed in May 2001; routine management continued with the new lead.
