# SUMMARY

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on linking below-ground biodiversity with above-ground plant responses at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Primary focus in this summary: above-ground productivity (biomass), plant species composition and diversity, and how management practices (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) drive botanical changes and functional community shifts.

- Site design and data collection (Methods)
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks across a downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots with randomised treatments.
  - Management and treatments (annual, since 1999):
    - Site-wide mowing to ~6 cm from May to September.
    - Insecticide application (Dursban 4) to designated plots after mowing.
    - Plot-level fertilisation with nitrogen and/or lime in spring.
  - Data streams and measurements:
    - Climate and weather data from an on-site Automatic Weather Station (1999–2002).
    - Above-ground productivity: biomass harvested from random 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots before each mow (1999–2002); samples oven-dried and weighed.
    - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998, then repeated point analyses (0.5 m2 cell with 100-point frame) in 2000–2002, including bryophyte identification in 2002.
    - Soil monitoring: soil pH (5 cm depth) annually; soil moisture (theta probe) measured in 2002 across point-analysis cells.
    - Additional small-scale surveys and biomass sampling by various projects; Appendix data provide extensive species lists and treatment summaries.
  - Research activity: Phase I projects largely completed by 2002; Phase II teams conducted major fieldwork, including CO2 pulse experiments and gas measurements.

- Key results by theme
  - Above-ground biomass and treatment effects
    - Long-term trend: biomass productivity increased from 1999 to 2002 across treatments, though 2002 showed reduced biomass relative to 2001 in several plots.
    - Fertilisation effect: plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime showed higher productivity; the strongest biomass gains occurred in plots with both nitrogen and lime.
    - Unfertilised plots: productivity lower and more variable; nutrient losses via clipping likely reduce long-term fertility.
    - Spatial pattern: productivity varied with slope position; lowest biomass in Block 5 and highest in lower blocks, reflecting microclimate/soil differences.
  - Soil pH, moisture, and productivity
    - Lime raised soil pH significantly, approaching 7 in limed plots; nitrogen had a smaller positive effect on pH.
    - Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH overall; wetter plots tended to be more acidic.
    - Positive association between higher pH and biomass when considering all treatments; within some treatments (e.g., N or lime alone) this relationship weakens; with both N and lime, the relationship can be negative, suggesting a more complex interaction with water availability.
  - Point analysis, diversity, and plant functional groups
    - Improved (fertilised) plots: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis dominated in point-hits, indicating a shift toward species associated with richer soils.
    - Unimproved plots: Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum more prevalent.
    - Bryophytes: systematic increase across the site, with Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus becoming more common; mosses contribute a growing share of total hits, particularly in unimproved plots.
    - Species dynamics: Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis declined substantially since 2000; Festuca rubra increased, especially in fertilised plots.
    - Diversity (Shannon Index): overall diversity increased in several treatments since 1998, but declined in the nitrogen-and-lime (N&L) plots relative to baseline.
    - Functional groups (CSR framework: Competitiveness C, Stress-tolerance S, Ruderal R)
      - In N&L plots, C-S-R and SR/C-S-R species became increasingly dominant, indicating a shift toward competitive-stress/ruderals under richer growth conditions.
      - In unimproved plots, stress-tolerant (S) species gained prominence.
      - Bryophytes and certain mosses show differential responses across treatments, contributing to functional group shifts.
    - Multivariate patterns: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of 2002 point data clearly separated improved from unimproved plots; lime-treated plots often grouped together; several nitrogen-treated samples tracked toward limed plots, indicating convergence in vegetation characteristics under certain nutrient amendments.
  - Insecticide and trampling effects
    - Insecticide effect: While direct links between insect herbivory and diversity are complex, results align with literature suggesting that reducing herbivory can benefit certain palatable species and potentially maintain higher diversity, though evidence is not definitive.
    - Trampling effect (notably in C2 plots during 13CO2 pulse experiments): intense trampling likely suppressed vegetation growth, contributing to observed productivity declines in those plots.

- Data quality, limitations, and notes
  - 2002 weather data had a temporary gap due to a station malfunction; some data were supplemented from a nearby station (Konza) for certain periods.
  - The C2 plots experienced trampling during labelled CO2 pulse activities, affecting productivity measurements in 2002.
  - Extensive appendix datasets (species lists, biomass time-series, soil data, and point-analysis results) support deeper analyses and cross-project data integration.

- Implications for data strategy and data leadership
  - The Sourhope dataset comprises long-term, multi-variable measurements across replicated plots and multiple treatments, illustrating the value of cohesive data management for cross-project insights.
  - Key data types to catalogue and share effectively include: biomass time-series by plot and treatment; detailed point-analysis species hits (including bryophytes); soil chemical data (pH, lime/N fertilisation history); soil moisture; weather data; and bryophyte/diversity indices.
  - For Data Leaders: ensure robust metadata, consistent measurement units, clear documentation of treatments and plot maps, and strategies for handling missing or disrupted data (e.g., weather station outages).
  - The integrated approach (production, diversity, functional groups, and microhabitat factors) demonstrates the value of co-owned, cross-disciplinary data products to inform policy-relevant understanding of ecosystem responses to management.

- Takeaway for practice
  - Management decisions strongly influence both productivity and community composition via nutrient status, disturbance regime, and soil chemistry; long-term, well-documented data programs are essential to disentangle these effects and predict system responses.
