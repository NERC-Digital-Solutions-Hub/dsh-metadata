# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

## Overview
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on intensive study of a large field experiment at the Sourhope site (Scottish Borders).
- Main outputs: monitoring of above-ground productivity, plant community composition and diversity, and functional community changes under different management treatments.
- Three major management processes drive botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide use; a fourth factor (trampling) also considered.
- Data collected since 1998 across multiple methods, enabling assessment of temporal trends and treatment effects.

## Experimental design and data collection
- Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, with 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA); mowing is site-wide (6 cm height, May–Sept).
- Data collected (since 1999–2002):
  - Weather: on-site Automatic Weather Station (temperature, rainfall, radiation, soil moisture).
  - Plant productivity: above-ground biomass from 0.5 m2 random harvests; samples dried and weighed.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline survey (1998) and annual point analysis surveys (1998 baseline; 2000–2002).
  - Soil chemistry and moisture: soil pH (5 cm depth), soil moisture (theta probe in 2002).
  - Site activity: frequent fieldwork across Phase I and II projects, including CO2 pulse tracing and trace-gas measurements.
- Analyses: ANOVA (split-plot), PCA, and diversity indices; tracking functional group composition (CSR framework).

## Key findings by management effect

### Mowing effect
- Dominant shift from Agrostis spp. to Festuca spp. (Festuca rubra especially) in improved plots; Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline by more than 40% since 2000.
- Bryophytes expand broadly, aided by a consistent 6 cm sward height and absence of grazing; this bloom is tempered in more fertile plots.
- Stress-tolerant (S) species expand across most treatments except where nitrogen + lime are applied; ruderal and SR/C-S-R groups decline with reduced disturbance.
- Potentially-site-wide factor(s) beyond mowing (e.g., historical grazing removal) influence these shifts across treatments.

### Fertilisation (Nitrogen and Lime) effect
- Productivity (above-ground biomass) consistently higher in fertilised plots; the strongest responses when both N and Lime are applied.
- By 2002, lime application raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in lime plots; nitrogen also increased pH but to a lesser extent.
- Productivity patterns show a potential ceiling in N+L plots (possibly due to higher pH and lower soil moisture).
- Correlations between pH and biomass are strong overall; 0.69–0.73 polynomial relationships observed, but within N-only or Lime-only plots the positive relationship weakens; in N+L plots the relationship may be negative, indicating a nuanced interaction between pH, moisture, and productivity.
- Diversity (Shannon index) declines under N+L treatment by 2002 (down ~15%), while other treatments show modest increases (2% to 29%).

### Insecticide (Dursban) effect
- Plant diversity patterns under insecticide-treated plots show changes consistent with some literature: possible links between reduced herbivory and higher diversity, but evidence is circumstantial.
- The insecticide’s direct impact on diversity is not definitively established; results align with the notion that herbivore pressure may affect palatable species differently under infertile conditions.

### Trampling effect
- In 2002, C2 plots (a subset of the fertilised/insecticide groups that experienced intense activity for labelled 13CO2 pulses) show notable reductions in biomass, attributed to trampling during pulses.
- This underscores how disturbance intensity can modulate productivity beyond nutrient status or herbivore management.

## Biomass productivity and community structure trends (1999–2002)
- Biomass generally increased across treatments from 1999 to 2002, but 2002 biomass fell relative to 2001 across all treatments.
  - Reductions in 2002 ranged from 13.7% (N&L) to 31.2% (Control 2).
- Long-term pattern: sustained rise in biomass relative to 1999 baselines, with nitrogen and lime most effective; the Control 2 plots consistently lagged controls in productivity.
- Spatial pattern: slope position matters; lower slope (Block 1) and higher slope areas show different magnitudes of biomass change.
- Biomass data aggregated per plot and Year x Treatment interaction are statistically significant, confirming treatment effects and year-to-year variability.

## Functional group and community composition changes
- Point analysis (2002) shows treatment-driven shifts in species hits:
  - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) have higher frequencies of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis hits; unimproved plots remain dominated by Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.
  - Bryophyte hits (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) are more frequent across treatments, with highest relative abundance in unimproved plots.
- PCA of point analyses reveals clear separation between improved and unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster distinctly; some nitrogen-treated samples align with limed plots.
- Functional groups (S, CSR, SR/CSR) show:
  - In unimproved plots, stress-tolerant species dominate.
  - In N+L plots, competitive (C) and stress-ruderal (SR) elements expand; SR/CSR reductions are observed in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
- Shannon diversity over time:
  - 2002 diversity index declines in N+L plots (about 15% drop vs baseline), while other treatments show diversity increases (2% to 29%).

## Notable species and bryophyte trends
- Dominant vascular species overall remain Agrostis capillaris and Festuca spp., but relative frequencies shift toward Festuca rubra in fertilised plots; Agrostis spp. decline across the site.
- Bryophytes, particularly Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, increase in hits and biomass share in 2001–2002, especially in unimproved plots, contributing to a higher bryophyte fraction of total hits and biomass.
- Mosses and liverworts show increasing representation in several surveys; some bryophyte species decline under N or lime or are less prevalent in N&L plots.

## Implications for environmental monitoring and data use
- The Sourhope site demonstrates how standardised monitoring can reveal robust, time-lagged environmental responses to management practices.
- Patterns show the value of integrating above-ground productivity, species diversity, functional group classifications (CSR framework), and soil chemistry/ moisture data to interpret ecosystem responses.
- Three practical challenges highlighted:
  - Increasing the value and interoperability of monitoring datasets by integrating with other data sources.
  - Improving accessibility of underlying data for external users to facilitate broader scrutiny and reuse.

## Endnotes and data sources
- Core data streams include: annual biomass harvests (May–Sept), 0.5 m2 point analyses (2000–2002), soil pH and moisture measures, weather data, and species lists (including bryophytes).
- Key analyses referenced: split-plot ANOVA (treatment, year, interaction), PCA for species composition, and Shannon diversity indices; Appendix data provide detailed species lists, biomass compilations, and weather metrics.
