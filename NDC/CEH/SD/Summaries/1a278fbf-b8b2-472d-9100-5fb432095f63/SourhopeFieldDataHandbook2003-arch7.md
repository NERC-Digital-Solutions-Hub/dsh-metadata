# SOIL ANALYSIS OF RIGG FOOT, SOURHOPE : BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of the Sourhope field data collection, focusing on Block 4 auger samples and related vegetation data.
  - Provides detailed georeferenced soil chemistry and physical property measurements linked to specific auger cores (4A–4F) and plots for GIS-based analysis.

- Spatial design and data structure
  - Block 4: Auger samples labeled 4A–4F, each with corresponding MLURI barcode and a full set of soil measurements.
  - Vegetation data: Block 4 vegetation surveys by plot (4A–4F) and subplots, including species totals and presence/absence indicators.
  - Data organization: Sample IDs, weights (mg), chemical/physical properties, pH, LOI, moisture loss, and C:N ratios are recorded per sample; vegetation data recorded per subplot within each plot.

- Block 4 auger sample measurements (key variables and typical ranges)
  - Weight (mg): roughly 5.67–6.01 mg per sample.
  - %N: 0.51–0.58% across samples.
  - %C: 6.80–8.02%; C:N ratio: 12.62–14.26.
  - Ca (meq/100g): 1.01–2.96; Na (meq/100g): 0.12–0.15; K (meq/100g): 0.58–0.81; Mg (meq/100g): 0.58–1.59.
  - %Moisture loss: 4.29–5.15%; %Loss on Ignition (LOI): 14.60–17.56%.
  - pH(H2O): 4.45–4.82; pH(CaCl2): 3.64–4.05.
  - Notes: Soils are acidic with moderate organic content (LOI ~14–18%), relatively low extractable base cations; C:N ratios around 12–14.

- Block 4 vegetation data (overview)
  - Plot-level and subplot-level vegetation surveys accompany the soil data.
  - Data structure includes species totals per subplot and per plot, with presence/absence indicators and counts across subplots.
  - Indicates varying species richness and community composition across 4A–4F plots.

- GIS and data product relevance for Block 4
  - Georeferenced linkage: Samples and plots tied to specific grid references and block coordinates, enabling spatial mapping of soil properties.
  - Thematic layers: 
    - Soil chemistry maps (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg) and soil physics (moisture loss, LOI, pH) by auger sample and plot.
    - Vegetation richness and species indicators by subplot/plot, enabling habitat and biodiversity mapping.
  - Integration opportunities: Combine Block 4 soil and vegetation data with ecotron and other blocks for longitudinal spatial analyses, cross-block comparisons, and ecosystem modelling.

- Data access and extensions
  - Each auger sample is associated with a barcode for traceability.
  - Supplemental datasets (e.g., vegetation associations, species lists) accompany the main measurements, enabling GIS-driven analyses and cross-referencing with other blocks and ecotron plots.

- Implications for GIS-based data products
  - Enables creation of high-resolution soil property maps at the Block 4 scale.
  - Supports spatial analyses of soil-vegetation relationships, pH and nutrient gradients, and organic matter distribution.
  - Facilitates temporal comparisons when combined with Block 5 data and ECOTRON plots for long-term monitoring within the Sourhope site.
