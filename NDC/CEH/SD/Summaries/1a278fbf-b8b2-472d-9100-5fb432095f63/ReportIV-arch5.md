# SUMMARY

- The document reports on four years of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on above-ground biomass, plant community composition, and diversity in a managed field experiment with multiple treatments.

## Overview of the Programme and Site

- Location: Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders.
- Aim: Understand soil biodiversity and its links to above-ground plant communities; examine how management (mowing, fertilization, insecticide) affects productivity and diversity.
- Design: Rigg Foot Experimental Site with 5 replicate blocks, each containing 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m2 analysis cells used for data collection.
- Treatments (main categories): 
  - Site-wide mowing (approximately 6 cm sward height, monthly May–Sept).
  - Plot-level applications: Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime (N&L), Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA), and Controls (Control 1 and Control 2).
- Time frame: Data collected 1998 baseline; full management implemented from 1999 onward; results and analyses cover 1999–2002.

## Data Collected and Key Variables

- Above-ground biomass
  - Measured by clipping 0.5 m2 sub-plots prior to each mow; samples dried (80°C) and weighed.
  - Five cuts per summer; annual biomass totals per plot; long-term trend shows productivity increases in fertilised plots, with declines in some unfertilised plots by 2002.
  - Data presented in Appendix 6 (annual biomass per plot; mean by block).

- Plant species composition and diversity
  - Point analysis surveys (0.5 m2 cell in sub-plots S, T, U, V) with 25- or 100-hole frameworks; baseline 1998; additional surveys in 2000, 2001, 2002.
  - Bryophyte identification enhanced in 2002; Appendix 3 includes full species list; bryophytes increase across the site (notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus).
  - Litter and dead vegetation hits recorded (changes across years).
  - Shannon Diversity Index calculated for each treatment across 2000–2002; diversity generally increases in some treatments and declines in others (notably a 15% drop in N&L plots by 2002 vs baseline).

- Functional plant groups (CSR framework)
  - Plants categorized into stress tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderals (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR).
  - Across 2000–2002, treatment differences emerge: C-S-R and SR/C-S-R become dominant in nitrogen+lime plots; stress-tolerant species rise in unimproved plots.
  - By 2002, significant differences between treatments in all three functional groups, with distinct shifts driven by pH/nutrient status and disturbance regime.

- Soil properties and moisture
  - Soil pH measured at 5 cm depth; lime treatments raise pH toward ~7.0 (more pronounced in upper soil).
  - Nitrogen alone raises pH less than lime; correlations observed:
    - Negative correlation between soil moisture and soil pH (r ≈ -0.68).
    - Positive relationship between soil pH and above-ground productivity overall; treatment-specific patterns vary (strong positive overall, but weakened or reversed in plots with both nitrogen and lime).

- Weather and site data
  - On-site Automatic Weather Station records temperature, rainfall, and other climate variables since 1999.
  - 2002 had weather data gaps due to a station malfunction (late July–November), with some data imputed from a nearby station (Konza) for those periods.
  - Overall 1999–2002 shows variable rainfall distribution; winter 2001/02 was unusually mild.

- Data provenance and scope
  - Regular data collection from 1999 onward; total soil samples collected by 2002: 11,621.
  - Research activity across Phase I and Phase II projects; large-scale fieldwork in 2002 including 13CO2 pulse experiments and trace-gas measurements.

## Data Processing, Analysis, and Documentation

- Data processing and analysis
  - Biomass data aggregated across five summer cuts per year; log-transformed for ANOVA.
  - Split-plot ANOVA (Genstat 6) used to test effects of Treatment, Year, and their interaction on biomass.
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) performed on the 2002 point-analysis data, with species ranked within treatments prior to PCA.
- Documentation and availability
  - Full experimental details, data collection methods, and treatment specifics are included in the report, with extensive appendices.
  - Biological species lists and method specifics are in Appendix 3; site activity and treatments in Appendix 2; weather data in Appendix 5; biomass by plot in Appendix 6; biomass rankings in Appendix 7; species abundance by year in Appendix 8.
  - Key data and project details publicly accessible via the Soil Biodiversity website: http://www.nerc-merlewood.ac.uk/soilbio/index.html or from CEH.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Observations

- Strengths
  - Longitudinal design with replicated blocks and controlled treatments.
  - Consistent data collection protocols across years; baseline data from 1998 allow trend analysis.
  - Integration of above- and below-ground perspectives through biomass, species composition, bryophyte dynamics, and functional groups.
- Limitations and caveats
  - 2002 weather data gaps due to station malfunction requiring data substitution for part of the year.
  - Some plots (e.g., C2) experienced trampling effects during intense experimental activity, potentially confounding biomass productivity changes.
  - Changes in bryophyte identification in 2002 improved species-level resolution, affecting cross-year comparability.
  - The relationship between soil pH and productivity varies by treatment, with potential risk of productivity decline if lime-induced pH increases continue.

## Implications for Data Stewardship

- Data governance and discoverability
  - The study generates rich, multi-dimensional datasets (biomass, species presence/absence and abundance, bryophyte data, litter, soil chemistry, moisture, and climate) across multiple treatments and years.
  - Data are hosted with project-specific appendices and publicly accessible metadata; central cataloging would enhance discoverability across projects.
- Metadata and data standards
  - Maintain consistent taxonomic nomenclature (note shifts in bryophyte identification in 2002) and clearly document treatment assignments, plot/block identifiers, sampling dates, and measurement units.
  - Capture processing steps (e.g., ln-transformations, PCA/ANOVA, baseline vs. follow-up surveys) in metadata to support reproducibility.
- Data quality and provenance
  - Preserve original measurement protocols, calibration notes, and any data corrections (e.g., imputed weather data for 2002).
  - Version control for datasets and appended analyses; record any changes to data collection methods over time.
- Data sharing and accessibility
  - Maintain and promote access through the Soil Biodiversity website; consider a consolidated data portal or data dictionary to improve cross-project reuse.
  - Provide clear data-use licenses and citation guidance; include appendices that describe plots, blocks, and treatments to ensure correct interpretation of data by downstream users.
- Operational recommendations
  - Maintain centralized data dictionaries for biomass, species IDs, and functional-group classifications.
  - Ensure robust archiving of large datasets (e.g., biomass time series, point-analysis hits) with standardized file formats and metadata fields.
  - Document and manage any missing data periods (e.g., weather station outages) and data substitutions to preserve data integrity.
