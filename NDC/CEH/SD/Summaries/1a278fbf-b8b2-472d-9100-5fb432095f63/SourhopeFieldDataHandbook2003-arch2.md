- Observations: near-surface horizons are more acidic and higher in LOI (organic matter) with very high LOI in the FH layer; deeper horizons show much lower LOI and different base cation patterns, indicating strong vertical differentiation and substantial organic matter input in the upper horizons.

## Block 5 Auger Samples: key measurements

- Samples: Auger analyses labeled 5A–5F with a full set of chemical measurements plus pH and moisture data.
- Net pattern across samples: %N 0.53–0.62%; %C 7.01–9.07%; C:N 13.13–14.74; Ca 2.58–5.08 meq/100g; Na 0.14–0.17 meq/100g; K 0.53–0.83 meq/100g; Mg 1.51–3.50 meq/100g; %Moisture loss 2.79–5.19%; %LOI 4.12–20.10%; pH H2O 4.34–4.95; pH CaCl2 3.53–4.14.
- Notable ranges:
  - Ca generally elevated in some samples (up to ~5.08 meq/100g in 5D Cg layer) and variable across horizons.
  - %LOI shows wide variation, with some horizons showing very high LOI (e.g., 20.10% in 5D 5F) and others much lower (4–9% in many horizons).
  - pH values consistently acidic (H2O ~3.5–4.95 depending on horizon and sample).
- Horizon context (where provided): multiple horizons (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with depth-based variation in nutrients and acidity; layers like Ah and AB tend to have higher N and C relative to deeper horizons, with LOI reflecting organic matter content.

## ECOTRON PLOT: soil data

- Weight (Wt): 6.089 mg.
- %N: 0.59; %C: 8.22; C:N: 13.83.
- Ca: 2.76 meq/100g; Na: 0.15; K: 0.62; Mg: 1.70 meq/100g.
- %Moisture loss: 4.79%; LOI: 17.42%.
- pH H2O: 4.79; pH CaCl2: 3.82.
- Interpretation: ECOTRON plot soil shows similar acidic pH, modest nutrient base cations, substantial organic matter (LoI ~17%), and typical mineral chemistry for upland soils.

## Vegetation surveys: blocks and ecotron plots

- Block 4 and Block 5 vegetation datasets provide species totals per plot and subplot, indicating a diverse herbaceous community with a mix of grasses, forbs, bryophytes, and typical upland moorland species.
- Notable structure: data detail species occurrences across multiple subplots (A–F, Ac, Ao, At, Br, etc.) with varying totals by plot, reflecting microhabitat heterogeneity and historical grazing/nutrient regimes.
- ECOTRON PLOT vegetation: corresponding Ac/Ao/At subplot records show presence/absence and totals for key taxa, illustrating differences between experimental and natural plots.

## Data management, storage, and accessibility

- Barcodes: Block 4 auger samples (4A–4F) and Block 5 auger/soil samples (5A–5F) carry MLURI barcodes for traceability.
- Storage: data and archived soil samples stored on MLURI servers with integration to ECN/Micronet data frameworks; long-term preservation is supported by frozen archive samples.
- Documentation: the data include explicit metadata (depth horizons, horizons names, subplots, plot-level treatments) to support repeatable time-series analyses and cross-site comparisons.

## Practical implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment

- Value: supports long-term, standardized monitoring of soil chemistry, organic matter, and acidity across multiple blocks, enabling consistent time-series analyses and policy-performance scrutiny.
- Data integration: combine Block 4/5 soil chemical data with vegetation surveys and ECN climate data to derive holistic indicators of soil health, vegetation resilience, and ecosystem responses to management.
- Data access: emphasize providing underlying datasets and metadata to downstream users via portals and documentation to avoid “single-use” outcomes and foster broader reuse.
