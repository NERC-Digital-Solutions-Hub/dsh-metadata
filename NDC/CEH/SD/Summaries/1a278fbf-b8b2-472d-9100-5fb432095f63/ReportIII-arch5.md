REPORT III
RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Context and aims
- Large-scale field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to establish broad context through monitoring across years to aid interpretation of more detailed studies.
- Emphasises data provenance, consistency of methods, and comparability across years to support cross-study linkage and meta-analysis.

## Data collection and governance notes
- Measurements documented in 1998 baseline and continued through 2001, with data collection aligned to established protocols (e.g., mowing, Point Analysis, 0.5 m2 sampling cells, 25-pin touches, annual biomass sums).
- Data types include:
  - Automatic Weather Station data (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture; downloaded regularly and transmitted to CEH Merlewood).
  - Above-ground biomass (multiple summer harvests and drying/weighting).
  - Soil pH (upper 5 cm; lime and nitrogen effects tracked).
  - Botanical composition (Point Quadrat surveys in July 2001; species hits and PCA analyses).
- Site management events affecting data collection in 2001:
  - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May 2001) limited site access; sampling proceeded under a defined protocol during restricted periods.
  - Change of site Officer in Charge in May 2001.
- Data handling: analyses used documented methods (split-plot ANOVA, Genstat 5; log transformations for biomass; PCA for species composition).
- Treatments included nitrogen, lime, nitrogen+lime, biocide, and controls across a multi-year design (2001 results shown with several figures/t tables).

## Key results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable relative to prior years.
- Rainfall in 2001 (~839 mm) closer to long-term average than 2000; total radiation (~3473 MJ m^-2) similar; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than the previous year.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass across the season, with peak production in July–August.
- 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to staff changes and a shift from manual mowing to mechanical cutting in 2001.
- When normalised to the control (C1) within each year, nitrogen and/or lime generally boosted biomass.
- ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots, and a significant year-by-treatment interaction, but no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime increased soil pH over time; by Oct 2001 average pH was 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots remained close to baseline August 1998 values.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 point-quadrat survey showed strong treatment-driven shifts in species relative abundance.
- Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. (ovina and rubra) increased and were most frequent in fertilised plots (notably N and/or Lime).
- Improved plots (N and/or Lime) featured species associated with enhanced pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis).
- Diversity declined with the most improved plots: 24 species identified in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime plots.
- Principal Components Analysis largely separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots associated with Bryophytes and Nardus stricta; improved plots linked with Festuca rubra and related species.
- Biomass correlated with species composition: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass increased.
- Increased litter in nitrogen and/or lime plots suggested faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F tended to be more acidic, a pattern amplified by the higher proportion of Control/Biocide plots in those columns.
- Suggests underlying spatial structure affecting pH and community composition.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Biomass showing spatial patterning across the site; higher biomass generally in plots more centrally located (e.g., certain N, L, N&L plots).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences among blocks.

## Data governance and quality considerations for Data Stewards
- Documented cross-year comparability: consistent protocols (Point Analysis, biomass harvesting, mowing schedule) and explicit year-by-year treatment definitions are essential for reproducibility.
- Metadata and provenance: linkage of plots, treatments, block structure, and changes in personnel and management (e.g., FMD restrictions, officer change) to ensure traceability.
- Data gaps and disruptions: FMD-related access restrictions led to period-specific sampling adaptations; clearly capture these in metadata and data catalogs.
- Data accessibility and re-use: weather data flow to CEH demonstrates established data channels; ensure all datasets (weather, biomass, soil pH, botanical surveys) are properly catalogued with tables/figures referenced (Table 1, Table 3, Tables 4–6, Figures 1–9, Appendix 1).
- Standardization and interoperability: note interpolation/normalisation approaches (e.g., normalising biomass to C1) and statistical transformations (ln) to enable cross-year comparisons.
- Implications for data quality: site heterogeneity and changes in mowing method (manual vs mechanical) should be captured as data quality notes; PCA and ANOVA outputs illustrate sensitivity to treatment and year effects.

## Summary takeaway for data stewardship
- The Sourhope 1999–2001 dataset provides a longitudinal, multi-dimensional view of how nutrient amendments, liming, and management practices influence biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community structure under a controlled field experiment.
- For data stewardship, the strongest value lies in preserving rich metadata on treatments, protocols, site management events, and spatial layout to support reliable cross-year analyses and integration with other datasets in the Sourhope project or broader soil biodiversity studies.
