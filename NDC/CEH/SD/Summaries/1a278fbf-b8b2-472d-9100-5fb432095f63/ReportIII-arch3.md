# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- The study is part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) by the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute.
- Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for detailed, group-specific studies and to facilitate year-to-year comparisons (design, methods, and management described in Baseline Data Survey, November 1998).
- A wide range of measurements and dates were planned to offer context and enable cross-project comparisons (Table 1 outlines measurement types and schedules).
- 2001 site management affected by two events:
  - Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions: no visitors Feb–May 2001; operations continued under protocol with vet oversight.
  - Change of the officer in charge in May 2001.
- Monitoring outputs were disseminated to stakeholders, with data governance considerations and public sharing of underlying data where feasible.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data were generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall near the long-term annual average; total radiation similar to previous years.
- Average temperatures slightly reduced; average soil moisture content modestly higher than in prior years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- A consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments throughout the sampling period; peak biomass occurred in July or August each year.
- 2001 biomass estimates were substantially higher than in previous years, likely due to a combination of changes in personnel and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Biomass data were normalised against the C1 treatment in each year to assess the effect of nitrogen and lime; nitrogen and/or lime treatments showed the strongest biomass response.
- Separate analyses (ln-transformed biomass, ANOVA) indicated:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L added) and non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Soil pH measured in the upper 5 cm showed continued pH increases with lime:
  - Limed plots averaged pH 6.19.
  - Nitrogen plus Lime plots averaged pH 6.38.
- Nitrogen addition alone raised pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed no significant change since the baseline in August 1998.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis mirrored July 2000 method; inter-surveyor differences were not significant.
- 2001 there were 58% more hits than in 2000, suggesting denser sward, potentially due to removal of grazing stock in 1998.
- Treatment effects on the most frequently encountered species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 (except remaining dominant in Control 1 and Limed plots).
  - Festuca species increased across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen-only and Biocide, or Nitrogen & Lime plots respectively.
  - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) showed more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots remained associated with species like Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Species richness:
  - 24 species identified in unimproved (Control, Biocide) plots; 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting a potential decline in diversity with the most improved plots.
- Multivariate analysis:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Improved plots often corresponded to more extreme PCA positions, with strong association of Festuca rubra (and related species) in limed plots.
- Biomass-related species shifts:
  - Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively correlated with above-ground biomass.
  - Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes and some bryophyte-associated species declined as biomass increased.
  - Litter increased in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) tended to be more acidic, though much of this is confounded by a higher proportion of Control and Biocide plots in those columns.
- Underlying spatial heterogeneity across the site influences pH and community composition patterns (not solely treatment effects).

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass values showed outliers with lower biomass on several plots, while higher biomass tended to be on plots more centrally located on the site (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, indicating fertility and pH gradients influence productivity.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks (statistical tests show p > 0.05 for block differences).

## Data Collection and Protocols (Highlights)
- Main data collection timelines span 1998–2001, including soil sampling, above-ground biomass harvests, and botanical surveys.
- A detailed mowing regime (KuboTa riding mower, 3-weekly in summer) and sub-plot sampling (S, T, U, V) were used to quantify biomass.
- Botanical surveys used a Point Quadrat frame with large pins dropped to record species hits; a second survey replicated measurements by year and by surveyor.
- A weather station on site provided ongoing meteorological data, shared with the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
- In 2001, special attention was given to data quality and governance, with careful protocol adherence during FMD restrictions.
- Appendix 1 provides annual above-ground biomass for each plot and block averages.
