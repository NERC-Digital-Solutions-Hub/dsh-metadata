# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Purpose and context
  - Large-scale field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scotland.
  - Aimed to provide a general context for detailed group studies and facilitate year-to-year comparisons; data collection planned to align with other projects and enable cross-site links.
  - Baseline data survey completed in 1998; monitoring across 1999–2001 documented in a format to support comparisons and data sharing among research groups.
  - 2001 site disruptions: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited access; management changes occurred (Officer in Charge changed).

- Data collected and structure
  - Core data types reported: Automatic Weather Station (weather), above-ground biomass, soil pH (top 5 cm), botanical (point quadrat) composition.
  - Measurement schedule and methods summarized (Table 1 references; mowing bouts, sampling dates, and protocols for biomass, soil, and vegetation surveys).
  - Data handling and analysis noted: log transformations of biomass for ANOVA;Correlation and PCA (Genstat 5) used to explore species–biomass links and treatment effects.
  - Data quality controls noted: comparison of surveyors in 2001 (no significant difference between two surveyors; consistency check).

- Key results

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - Headline measures broadly unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after very wet previous year.
    - Radiation similar to prior years; temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Consistent treatment hierarchy in biomass across the sampling period; peak biomass in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to staffing changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Biomass data normalized to a reference plot (C1) to compare treatment effects over time.
    - ANOVA (ln-transformed biomass) showed:
      - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots.
      - Significant treatment × year interaction.
      - No significant block effects.
    - Overall, nitrogen and lime had the strongest positive impact on above-ground productivity.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime addition continued to raise surface soil pH (to about 6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots by Oct 2001).
    - Nitrogen addition alone also raised soil pH, though to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots showed little change since baseline (Aug 1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Quadrat protocol matched 2000 survey; inter-surveyor consistency established.
    - 2001 survey recorded 58% more hits than 2000, indicating higher sward density, potentially from grazing removal in 1998.
    - Treatment effects on species composition:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining dominant only in Control and Limed plots.
      - Festuca species increased across treatments, especially Festuca rubra in limed plots and Festuca ovina in nitrogen plots.
      - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) showed more Poa pratensis and Poa trivialis; unimproved plots retained species associated with poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
    - Diversity: unimproved treatments had 24 species; nitrogen+lime plots had 18 species, suggesting diversity decline with stronger fertility improvements.
    - Multivariate analysis (PCA) indicated clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots associated with bryophytes and certain stress-tolerant species, while improved plots aligned with Festuca rubra and associated grasses.
    - Biomass correlations: higher biomass linked with increased Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; higher biomass associated with reduced relative presence of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes; greater litter incidence in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots, reflecting faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

- Site heterogeneity

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community
    - Observed spatial heterogeneity across the site (right-hand columns E/F tended to be more acidic); underlying patterns suggested by column composition (more unimproved plots in some columns).
    - Soil pH differences within columns aligned with treatment type, indicating spatial structure in pH across the site.

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Total biomass varied by location: higher biomass often in more central plots (e.g., certain nitrogen+lime and lime plots).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, indicating fertility–growth linkage.
    - No statistically significant differences in biomass between blocks.

- Data interpretation and integration
  - Data trends show nitrogen and lime affirmation of productivity and soil chemistry changes, with clear ecological shifts in species composition toward grasses typical of improved pastures.
  - Inter-year consistency highlights robust treatment effects, while acknowledging site heterogeneity and management disruptions in 2001.
  - The dataset supports cross-year comparisons and integration with other project data, and provides a basis for linking soil chemistry, biomass, and plant community metrics.
