# SUMMARY

- Overview
  - Four-year study (NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme) at Sourhope focusing on above-ground productivity (biomass), plant species composition, and diversity across a managed grassland with five plot-level treatments and a site-wide mowing regime.
  - Treatments include Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Insecticide; site management includes monthly mowing to ~6 cm and, in insecticide plots, application of Dursban 4 OPA after mowing.
  - Aims include linking above-ground plant responses to soil conditions (pH, moisture) and management practices, and to understand functional changes in plant communities.

- Data collection and sources
  - Weather data: On-site Automatic Weather Station (1999–2002) with some missing dates in 2002 due to equipment malfunction (Jul–Nov); missing dates filled using data from Konza station when necessary.
  - Above-ground biomass: Annual biomass estimates from five summer cuts (May–Sept) per plot, using 0.5 m2 sampling cells; samples oven-dried and weighed.
  - Point analysis surveys: Baseline (July 1998) with 25-point quadrat, followed by extensive 0.5 m2 cell surveys in 2000, 2001, 2002 using 100-hole grid per cell; bryophytes identified to species in 2002; species lists (Appendix 3).
  - Soil data: Regular soil pH measurements (since 1998; pH at 5 cm depth; March and August 2002 measurements in plot centers and analysis cells); soil moisture (theta probe) measured August 2002; additional soil sampling totals 11,621 samples to date.
  - Output products and activity: 16 Phase I projects and 7 of 8 Phase II projects involved fieldwork in 2002; data and results shared via appendices and project reports.

- Key data patterns and findings
  - Biomass productivity
    - Fertilised plots (Nitrogen and/or Lime) show sustained higher productivity; the strongest gains in plots receiving both Nitrogen and Lime (N&L).
    - In 2002, absolute biomass declined across many treatments despite long-term upward trend since 1999; Block-level (slope position) effects observed, with lower productivity at upper/sloped positions (Block 5 lowest increase; Block 1 lowest increase in different years).
    - Control 2 plots generally less productive than Control 1 in 2002, reflecting possible management or sampling differences.
    - Statistical: significant treatment effects in 2002; clear year×treatment interactions.
  - Soil chemistry and moisture
    - Lime increases soil pH toward ~7.0 in treated plots; nitrogen alone also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Higher soil pH correlates positively with biomass production across treatments; however, within N- or Lime-treated plots, the positive biomass–pH relationship weakens (and may become negative when both N and Lime are applied), suggesting a more complex, non-linear response.
    - Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (drier, limed plots tend to be less moist).
  - Plant community structure and functional groups
    - Functional shift: fertilised plots shift from stress-tolerant (S) toward competitive (C) and ruderal (R) types; unimproved plots retain stress-tolerant species.
    - Dominant species: Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis decline substantially (~40%) since 2000; Festuca rubra expands especially in fertile plots; Festuca ovina declines slightly with a rise in Festuca rubra frequency; Poa pratensis increases in fertilised plots.
    - Bryophyte expansion: bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increase across the site, more pronounced in unimproved plots; mosses contribute a growing share of total hits and biomass in 2001–2002.
  - Biodiversity and species diversity
    - Shannon diversity index: overall increases in most treatments over time, but a relative decline in the nitrogen+lime treatment by 2002 (compared to baseline); insecticide plots show notable increases in diversity.
  - Point-analysis insights
    - PCA of 2002 point data separates improved vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster distinctly; nitrogen-treated samples sometimes align with limed plots, others align with controls.
    - Early dominance shifts: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis are more represented in fertilised plots; Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum more common in unimproved plots.
    - Bryophyte representation rises with time, especially in unimproved plots; litter hits increase in 2001–2002.
  - Trampling and 13CO2 experiment
    - The 2002 C2 plots show reduced productivity likely due to trampling during intense sampling and pulse-labeling activities.

- Data products and potential uses for data support
  - Dashboards and reports illustrating: biomass by treatment and year; treatment effects and year interactions; soil pH and moisture vs biomass; functional-group composition by treatment; PCA plots showing plant community separation; bryophyte trends and litter dynamics; Shannon diversity changes by treatment.
  - Data modeling opportunities: regression of biomass on soil pH and moisture; CSR-type functional-group shifts; species-hits by treatment; inter-annual trends and slope-position effects.
  - Reuse potential: cross-project comparisons within Soil Biodiversity Programme; long-term integration of above- and below-ground responses; standardization of plots, treatments, and sampling units for data sharing.

- Challenges and data quality considerations
  - Data gaps and issues
    - 2002 weather data includes missing periods due to weather station malfunction; dates July–November substituted with Konza station data.
    - C2 trampling effects and atypical sampling activity can confound biomass measurements in 2002.
    - Baseline data exist from 1998; subsequent point analyses collected in 2000–2002; bryophyte identifications improved in 2002.
  - Data structure and harmonization
    - Multiple data layers: plot-level treatments, block design (5 blocks), subplots and 0.5 m2 cells, five annual cuts, and numerous auxiliary surveys (vegetation cover, biomass, litter, bryophytes, moisture, pH).
    - Appendices provide detailed treatments, species lists, weather, biomass, and PCA results to support downstream analyses.
  - Data interpretation considerations
    - Complex interactions between nutrient status, soil pH, moisture, disturbance regime (mowing vs grazing exclusion), and insecticide effects on plant diversity.
    - Functional-group dynamics (CSR framework) used to interpret ecological responses to management gradients.

- Implications for data support and future work
  - The dataset supports exploration of how management practices (nutrient addition, liming, insecticide, mowing) shape productivity and plant community structure, including functional-type shifts and bryophyte dynamics.
  - Opportunities exist to develop self-serve data products (interactive dashboards) and to integrate biomass, soil chemistry, and biodiversity metrics into composite indicators for grassland policy and land-use decision-making.
  - Documentation and data sharing would benefit from a relational data model linking plots, blocks, treatments, years, sampling events, and species observations to enable reproducible analyses and cross-study comparisons.
