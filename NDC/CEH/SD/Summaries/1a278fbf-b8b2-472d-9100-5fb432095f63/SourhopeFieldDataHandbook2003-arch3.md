# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Programme at Sourhope Experimental Farm.
  - Describes a long-term, integrated monitoring framework combining field design, standardized sampling, data archiving, and policy-relevant ecological insights.
  - Emphasizes multi-source data (vegetation, soil) to evaluate soil biodiversity, vegetation–soil relationships, and management impacts; supports evidence-based decision-making.

- Site context and environment
  - Location: Sourhope Farm, Bowmont valley, Scotland; north-facing slope on Sourhope soils.
  - Climate and networks: Humid upland conditions; part of long-term environmental monitoring networks (ECN).
  - Geology and soils: Old Red Sandstone-derived lavas; soils range from acid brown forest soils to peaty gleys and podzols; drainage and depth vary across blocks.
  - Land use and facilities: Predominantly grassland with grazing; established laboratories and field facilities; linked to central data servers; hosts researcher facilities.

- Experimental design and layout
  - Site and blocks: Five blocks (1–5) established on a slope; block-specific plots and subplots arranged to capture variability.
  - Plot design: Main plots subdivided into multiple subplots; dedicated Ecotron-related plot for controlled environment studies.
  - Treatments: Six main treatments randomly assigned per main plot (Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Lime & Nitrogen, Biocide, Fallow); grazing halted and plots fenced to standardize conditions; fallow later omitted.
  - Management: Regular mowing during growing season; grazing previously by sheep/goats; restricted deer/rabbit access.

- Vegetation and soil sampling methods
  - Vegetation surveys: Within a subset of subplots per main plot; presence/absence data with potential abundance; 25 points per 50 x 50 cm quadrat; repeated over time for community analyses.
  - Soil sampling and analysis: 0–30 cm cores collected in a W-pattern; depth profiles with horizon descriptions; samples archived at -80°C; analyses include N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; moisture loss, loss on ignition (LOI), and pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Data handling: Samples labeled with site-specific barcodes; horizon- and plot-level data stored with detailed metadata and archiving protocols.

- Data structure and analysis
  - Data organization: Extensive per-block and per-plot datasets with horizon-level detail; appendices document soil horizons and vegetation data by plot/subplot.
  - Vegetation analysis: Classification (Twinspan), National Vegetation Classification (NVC) matching, and presence/absence association analyses.
  - Soil analysis: Correlations and regressions among soil variables; principal components to summarize variation; horizon- and block-specific analyses.
  - Example findings: Dominant vegetation patterns and species indicators; soil horizons showing acidity gradients and nutrient relationships; horizon- and block-level moisture and mineral changes.

- Integration with monitoring networks and long-term monitoring
  - ECN integration: Sourhope serves as a UK Environmental Change Network site for soil, air, water quality, and biodiversity monitoring.
  - Micronet involvement: Participation in Micronet projects to explore relationships between soil microbial communities and plant communities in grasslands.
  - Policy relevance: Long-term, scalable data collection to support understanding of soil–vegetation interactions and responses to management under climate and environmental change.

- Data governance, metadata, and accessibility
  - Rigorous metadata: Detailed site descriptors, horizon descriptions, sampling protocols; standardized barcoding ensures traceability.
  - Archiving and samples: Soil samples archived (e.g., -80°C) with horizon-by-horizon records; appendices support reproducibility and future analyses.
  - Data sharing: Structured datasets with comprehensive methodological documentation designed for dissemination within the research and policy community; emphasis on data provenance and governance.

- Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a robust, replicable monitoring framework combining long-term ecological design, standardized multi-source data streams (vegetation and soil), and explicit data governance.
  - Highlights importance of complete metadata, data archiving, data provenance, and overcoming data-sharing barriers through clear data structures.
  - Provides a template for integrating climate/soil–vegetation data with broader environmental monitoring networks to support adaptive management and evidence-based decisions.

- Specific data content (as exemplified in Blocks 4 and 5)
  - Detailed soil profiles (e.g., Block 4 and Block 5) including horizon descriptions (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and color/structure interpretations.
  - Horizon-specific soil analyses: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Auger and composite samples: Individual sample IDs, weights, and chemical attributes across horizons and horizon groups.
  - Vegetation surveys by plot and subplot: Species counts, totals, and community composition indicators across blocks and plots.
  - ECOTRON specifics: Separate soil analyses and vegetation data for ECOTRON PLOT, including barcodes, weight, N, C, moisture metrics, and pH.

- Endnotes
  - The document combines rich, high-resolution soil and vegetation data with a structured, governance-focused approach to monitoring, making it a practical reference for practitioners designing policy-relevant monitoring frameworks.
