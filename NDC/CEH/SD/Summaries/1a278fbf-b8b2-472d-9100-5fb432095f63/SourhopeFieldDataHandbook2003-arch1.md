ECONOMICALLY RELEVANT PATTERNS FOR ANALYSIS (observed from the data)
- Soil organic matter and acidity
  - Surface horizons (FH/Ah) show very high organic matter as indicated by LOI values and elevated C; acidity is strongly expressed with low pH in H2O and CaCl2 across horizons.
- Nutrient status and base cations
  - Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) dominate exchange sites in several horizons, with Ca often highest in FH/H and diminishing with depth; Mg follows a similar pattern but at lower absolute values.
- Carbon and nitrogen relationships
  - %C and %N are tightly coupled, especially in surface horizons; C:N ratios commonly in the mid-teens to around 20 in the FH horizon, narrowing in deeper horizons.
- Pedogenic differentiation and texture
  - Depth progression shows increasing silty/clay-rich characteristics in deeper horizons (e.g., Bg, BCg, Cg) with strong mottling and igneous stone presence, influencing moisture retention and root penetration.
- Vegetation–soil linkages
  - Vegetation composition varies with horizon depth and soil chemistry; surveys indicate patchy, horizon-structured plant communities with grasses and forbs responding to soil fertility and moisture regimes.
- Data richness and use
  - Rich horizon- and plot-level data enable multivariate analyses (e.g., linking N, C, LOI, pH, Ca/Mg with vegetation metrics) and the development of predictive models for soil–vegetation dynamics under different management or perturbation scenarios.

Practical implications for analysis and modelling
- Use horizon- and plot-level soil chemistry to model vegetation responses to acidity, nutrient availability, and organic matter dynamics.
- Compare ECOTRON and field plots to understand microenvironmental effects on soil–vegetation interactions.
- Assess how igneous parent material and stone content influence texture, nutrient distribution, and moisture behavior across depths.
- Leverage the detailed auger and horizon datasets to explore correlations between soil properties (N, C, LOI, Ca, Mg, pH) and plant community composition, diversity, and structure.
