## Data Assets in this extract

### Block 4
- Soil profiles
  - Depths and horizon naming (LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx) with detailed soil descriptions (color, texture, structure, roots, boundary clarity).
  - Depth ranges and boundary types (e.g., sharp smooth, sharp wavy).
- Soil analyses by horizon
  - Parameters: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O), pH (CaCl2).
  - Examples: FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx horizons show progressive changes in nutrients, carbon content, and acidity with depth.
- Auger samples (Block 4)
  - For horizons 4A–4F with measurements: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O/CaCl2).
- Vegetation survey (Block 4)
  - Plot-level presence/absence and abundance for various species codes (e.g., Ac, Ao, Fr, Gs Hm, Pe, Pt, Tr, etc.).
  - Totals by plot indicating species richness and composition.

### Block 5
- Block 5 site details
  - Site location and characteristics: grid reference NT8544019520, altitude 315 m, slope 5°, imperfect drainage, soil series/subgroup, and rock material.
- Soil profiles
  - Horizons LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with descriptive texture and mottling; clear horizons and boundary types.
- Soil analyses by horizon (Block 5)
  - Parameters as in Block 4 (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2).
- Auger samples (Block 5)
  - Analyses for 5A–5F horizons with the same suite of chemical and physico-chemical measurements.
- Vegetation survey (Block 5)
  - Plot/subplot level data for multiple species, including presence/abundance codes and species totals across subplots.
  
### ECOTRON SITE
- Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT)
  - Snapshot of a single plot with weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
- Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT)
  - Species presence/abundance across subplots with totals, indicating community structure on the ecotron plot.

## Data Collection Methods
- Soil sampling
  - Horizon-focused sampling with descriptive horizons (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.) and auger-based cores (0–30 cm) for Block 4 and Block 5.
  - Measurements include pH (H2O and CaCl2), %N, %C, C:N, LOI, %Moisture loss, and exchangeable cations (Ca, Na, K, Mg).
- Vegetation surveys
  - Plot-level assessments using species codes, recording presence and abundance (and species totals) per subplot within each plot.
  - Data entries show gaps (.) where data were not recorded, with varying completeness across blocks.
- Data handling
  - Weighing of samples (Wt mg) for horizon and auger samples; barcode-based tracking (MLURI Barcodes) for each horizon and auger sample.
  - Hierarchical horizon labeling and consistency checks against site metadata.

## Data Processing and Analysis
- Multivariate and community analyses (referenced in broader document)
  - Horizon-level data enable interpretation of nutrient cycling, soil acidity, and organic matter with depth.
- Vegetation data
  - Species occurrence and abundance support community classification and alignment with vegetation types; data show block- and plot-level variation.
- Data quality notes (in broader context)
  - Some blocks/plots have incomplete vegetation data; horizon analyses show depth-related trends with occasional anomalous values requiring careful interpretation.
  - Consistency across horizons, units, and codes is essential for longitudinal analysis.

## Data Storage, Archiving, and Access
- Storage and governance
  - Data managed by MLURI and linked to ECN and SERAD Micronet projects; archived samples at CEH Merlewood (-80°C).
- Accessibility
  - Data and related appendices are publicly accessible via project websites and supporting repositories (e.g., ECN/Soil Biodiversity Programme portals).

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Governance
- Limitations
  - Incomplete vegetation coverage in some blocks; results are indicative/baseline for long-term studies.
  - Some horizon data show missing values (e.g., Na in Block 4 horizon measurements) and block-specific anomalies.
- Governance implications for Data Stewards
  - Metadata completeness is critical: precise geolocation, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, horizon nomenclature, depths, and sampling years must be consistently documented.
  - Standardization needs: harmonize species codes, plot/subplot identifiers, horizon labels, measurement units, and analytic methods across blocks and years.
  - Provenance and traceability: maintain audit trails for data collection, processing (including Twinspan/NVC/Association analyses), and archival storage.
  - Discoverability and reuse: ensure datasets are discoverable through ECN/MAC networks and repositories; include method details, deviations, and sampling histories.
  - Updates and versioning: carefully record treatment changes, plot allocations, and sampling strategy evolutions; preserve historical versions for longitudinal analyses.

## Endnotes for this extract
- Appendix-like blocks include block-by-block site details, soil profile descriptions, archived sample identifiers, and extensive tables for horizon-level chemistry and vegetation counts, supporting longitudinal biodiversity and soil research.
