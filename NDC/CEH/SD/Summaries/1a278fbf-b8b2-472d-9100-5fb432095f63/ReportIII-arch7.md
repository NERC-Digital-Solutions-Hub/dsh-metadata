## RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, within the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed at linking soil biodiversity, vegetation dynamics, and management practices across a nutrient and lime treatment matrix.
  - Data presented to facilitate cross-comparison with other research groups and years; includes site management context and methodological notes.

- Data Collected and Experimental Design
  - Location and design
    - Sourhope field site with a structured, multi-plot design (block structure; subplot-level sampling across treatments).
    - Treatments include nitrogen, lime, both nitrogen and lime, a biocide, and unimproved controls; data presented per plot and per subplot.
  - Measurements and methods
    - Above-ground biomass: five summer mowing occasions per year; biomass per 0.5 m2 sample plots; total annual biomass, with ln-transformed ANOVA analyses.
    - Soil pH: measurements at the upper 5 cm; pH tracked over time, highlighting lime and nitrogen effects.
    - Botanical composition: July Point Quadrat surveys (100-cell grid; 25 pins per cell) to generate species hits per plot; species codes and relative abundance analyzed (PCA, etc.).
    - Weather: Automatic Weather Station on-site; daily/periodic data collection including rainfall, radiation, soil moisture, and temperatures; data shared with MLURI data management.
  - Timeframe and events
    - Main data collection for 1999–2001 with baseline in 1998.
    - 2001 site-management impacted by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (visitor access halted Feb–May 2001; subsequent protocol-led sampling).
    - A change in site officer in May 2001; mechanical harvesting adopted in 2001, affecting biomass measurements.

- Key Findings by Topic
  - Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture higher than in preceding year.
  - Above-ground biomass (2001 and across years)
    - Clear treatment hierarchy: nitrogen and/or lime generally increased biomass; nitrogen plus lime most effective; peak biomass in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass substantially higher than previous years, likely due to personnel changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Year-to-year analyses show significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; limited block effects.
  - Soil pH
    - Lime increases soil pH significantly (e.g., October 2001: 6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots).
    - Nitrogen alone also raises pH, but to a lesser extent; control plots show little change since 1998 baseline.
  - Botanical composition (July 2001 Point Quadrat)
    - 58% more total hits in 2001 than 2000, indicating denser vegetation, possibly from grazing removal in 1998.
    - Species shifts by treatment: Agrostis capillaris declines across treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increases broadly; improved plots show more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; less-diverse species lists in the most improved plots (24 species in unimproved vs 18 in nitrogen+lime).
    - PCA shows treated plots (N and/or Lime) separated from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots associate with bryophytes and Nardus stricta; improved plots associate with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis.
    - Biomass correlates with specific species abundances: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively associated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline as biomass increases; litter frequency increases in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots.
  - Site heterogeneity
    - Spatial variation across the site: columns E/F (right-hand slope) tend to have more acidic plots; underlying spatial heterogeneity observed across the site.
    - Biomass variation shows central plots often with higher biomass; spatial patterns correlate with surface pH (positive pH–biomass relationship).
  - Relationship between biomass and pH
    - Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass across plots; spatial blocks did not show a significant biomass difference.
  - Data collection context and quality
    - Consistency checks for botanical surveys: no significant difference between surveyors in 2001; 2001 field operations affected by FMD and equipment changes; data collection protocols largely maintained with formal site plan.
    - Appendix and tables provide detailed breakdowns of biomass by plot, year, and treatment; species-by-treatment abundance data; weather and measurement schedules.

- Implications for GIS-based data products
  - Potential map layers
    - Plot-level biomass density (2001 and multi-year totals) by treatment and block.
    - Soil pH maps by plot and year, highlighting lime and nitrogen effects.
    - Species distribution maps from Point Quadrat results (dominant species per plot; changes across years/treatments).
    - Spatial heterogeneity maps showing pH, biomass, and biomass-to-pH relationships across the site.
  - Temporal and multivariate perspectives
    - Time-series maps or animations to show year-to-year biomass and pH shifts.
    - PCA-driven visualization to illustrate separation of treated vs unimproved plots in species space.
  - Data integration and quality
    - Link plot-level data to weather context to explore climate influence on biomass and pH.
    - Capture site heterogeneity features (e.g., slope position, column grouping) to interpret spatial patterns.
  - Practical considerations
    - FMD-related access restrictions and personnel changes should be documented in GIS metadata as data-quality and collection-context notes.
    - Consistency of measurement methods (e.g., mowing technique, biomass calculation, point quadrat methodology) should be encoded in data lineage and metadata.

- Endnotes and Supporting Details
  - Acknowledgements reference key personnel (e.g., Sarah Buckland) and site staff; data management and on-site infrastructure (Automatic Weather Station) supported by MLURI and CEH.
  - Detailed tables and figures (Tables 1–6; Figures 1–9; Appendix 1) provide granular, plot-level insights on biomass, pH, species abundance, and their interrelationships across 1999–2001.

- Summary Takeaway
  - The Sourhope field experiment demonstrates clear, plot-level responses to nutrient (nitrogen) and liming (lime) treatments, with biomass and pH responding as expected and plant communities reorganizing accordingly. Spatial heterogeneity and year-to-year changes (including 2001 management disruptions) underscore the value of high-resolution GIS-ready datasets to map and analyse the interplay between soil chemistry, vegetation structure, and management actions across a complex field trial.
