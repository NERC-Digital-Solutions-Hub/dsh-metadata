# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The Sourhope field experiment at MLURI in the Scottish Borders investigates how nutrient and management treatments affect biomass, soil chemistry, and plant communities, with data collected across 1999–2001 and baseline context from 1998.
- Measurements include above-ground biomass, soil pH, botanical composition (Point Quadrat surveys), and weather data from an automatic station; analyses use ANOVA, transformations, and PCA to compare treatments and year-to-year changes.

## Key Findings

- Weather and site conditions (2001)
  - 2001 rainfall near the long-term average; radiation similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than in prior years.
  - Site management disruptions in 2001: foot-and-mouth-related access restrictions (Feb–May); change of Officer in Charge in May; one biocide application in May was missed but subsequent applications completed.

- Above-ground biomass
  - A consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments, with peak biomass in July–August each year.
  - 2001 biomass was substantially higher than in 2000, likely due to a combination of staff change and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - When normalised to a control (C1) within each year, nitrogen and/or lime additions produced greater biomass than unimproved plots; significant treatment-by-year interaction but no significant block effects.
  - Overall, nitrogen and lime (especially nitrogen plus lime) most strongly promoted productivity.

- Soil pH
  - Liming continued to raise topsoil pH; October 2001 pH averaged around 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen-plus-lime plots.
  - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, though to a lesser extent; control plots showed little change since baseline (August 1998).

- Botanical composition (Point Quadrat survey)
  - 2001 saw a 58% increase in total hits compared with 2000, indicating higher sward density (potentially from grazing stock removal in 1998).
  - Clear treatment differences in dominant species:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, except remains most abundant in some unimproved plots.
    - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in fertilised plots (Festuca rubra in N&L; Festuca ovina in N).
    - Fertilised plots showed more Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra, while less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) were more common in unimproved plots.
  - Species richness declined with the most improved plots: 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots.
  - Multivariate PCA showed clear separation: nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots clustered away from control/biocide plots.
  - Biomass correlates with species composition: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance rose with higher biomass; conversely, species like Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta tended to decline as biomass increased.
  - Litter increase accompanied higher nitrogen and/or lime, suggesting faster turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

- Spatial variation across the field: columns on the slope (especially E/F) tended to have more acidic conditions and lower pH, partly due to treatment composition (many controls/biocide plots in those columns).
- Biomass varied by location, with higher cumulative biomass typically in more central plots (e.g., certain N & L and Biocide plots).
- A strong positive correlation was observed between surface soil pH and biomass, while blocking effects were not significant.

## Methods and Data Handling

- Field design: large-scale field experiment with multiple sub-plots per plot, across several treatment types (Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide).
- Data collection: annual measurements of above-ground biomass (multiple cuts), soil pH (0–5 cm), botanical surveys (Point Quadrat), and weather data from an on-site Automatic Weather Station.
- Analyses: log transformations of biomass data; split-plot ANOVAs to assess treatment and year effects; inter-year comparisons; Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to explore species–biomass relationships; correlation analyses between species hits and biomass.

## Management and Temporal Context

- 2001 saw significant external disruption (FMD-related access restrictions) and internal changes (new Officer in Charge); these factors coincided with a notable 2001 biomass increase, highlighting potential confounding effects of management and sampling changes on interpretation.
- The timing and execution of treatments (notably a missed biocide application in May 2001) are noted as part of the context for year-to-year comparisons.

## Conclusions and Implications

- Fertilisation with nitrogen and lime enhances biomass production and drives clear shifts in plant community composition toward more productive species ( Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and away from less fertile-associated species.
- Soil pH, driven by liming and to a lesser extent nitrogen, emerges as a key driver of biomass and community structure.
- Increased sward density in 2001 corresponded with changes in species frequencies and litter dynamics, suggesting higher fertility accelerates turnover.
- The data show robust treatment effects but also underscore the importance of accounting for site heterogeneity and management changes when interpreting long-term field experiments.
