Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report 2002

# Overview
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity under five main experimental treatments.
- Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, with 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block divided into sub-plots for diverse group activity.
- Management: monthly mowing (~6 cm) across the whole site; insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) applied to designated plots; nitrogen and/or lime added to fertilised plots.

# Treatments and Data Collection
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Biocide prior label).
- Data collected since 1998–1999 include:
  - Above-ground biomass (0.5 m2 samples, multiple mowing dates per year; oven-dried weight).
  - Point analysis surveys (per year: 2000, 2001, 2002) with 25-point and 100-point grids to identify species hits.
  - Soil pH measurements (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe, in 2002 for point-analysis cells).
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (1999–2002).
  - Bryophyte and vascular plant species lists; occasional minirhizotron & litter surveys.

# Key Findings

- Mowing effect
  - Dominant shift: Festuca spp. expansion at expense of Agrostis spp. across treatments.
  - Stress-tolerant (S) species expanded under most conditions; SR/C-S-R group declines post-grazing removal.
  - Bryophytes (mosses) expanded broadly, possibly aided by uniform mowing height (~6 cm) and absence of grazing for ~5 years.

- Fertilisation effect
  - Productivity (above-ground biomass) increased with nitrogen and/or lime, with the largest gains where both were applied (Nitrogen + Lime).
  - Productivity in some highly-fertilised plots (N+L) may be peaking; soils pH in lime-treated plots approached 7.0 by 2002.
  - A potential moisture limitation emerges in N+L plots due to higher growth and lower soil moisture, possibly contributing to summer stress.

- Insecticide effect
  - Plant diversity (Shannon Index) highest in Insecticide plots; evidence remains circumstantial regarding a direct link to reduced herbivory.
  - The observed pattern mirrors classic insect-plant interaction expectations: insect control may benefit more palatable species; overall diversity remains relatively high in infertile conditions.

- Trampling effect
  - 2002 biomass reductions in C2 plots likely tied to trampling during intensive 13CO2 pulse activities; differences between C1 and C2 plots reflect management intensity rather than treatment alone.

- Community composition and functional groups
  - Functional group shifts (CSR framework):
    - N+L plots: marked expansion of competitive (C) and stress-ruderal (SR) types, i.e., CSR-dominant communities.
    - Unfertilised/unimproved plots: stress-tolerant (S) species gain dominance.
  - Point analysis shows increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in fertilised plots, and a decline of Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp. in some treatments.
  - Bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increase across treatments, particularly in unimproved plots; overall bryophyte hits rose from 6.48% (2000) to 19.92% (2002).

- Diversity and community structure
  - Shannon Diversity Index: 2002 shows a 15% decline in nitrogen + lime plots versus increases (2–29%) in other treatments.
  - PCA of 2002 point analysis data cleanly separates lime-treated plots from others; some N-treated samples cluster with limed plots, indicating convergent vegetation characteristics under these nutrient/pH conditions.
  - The dominant vascular plant hits shift: Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline since 2000; Festuca rubra increases in fertilised plots.

- Biomass and productivity trends
  - 2002 biomass generally lower than 2001 across most treatments; however, long-term trend since 1999 is an overall increase in biomass relative to baseline.
  - Greatest biomass gains in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime; Control 2 plots lag behind controls 1 due to different usage and disturbance.
  - A clear slope-related pattern: Block 5 shows the largest biomass decrease, indicating spatial variability along the downslope gradient.

# Relationship Between Soil Chemistry, Moisture, and Productivity
- Lime application significantly raises soil pH (near 7.0 in lime-treated plots); nitrogen also raises pH modestly.
- Strong negative correlation between soil moisture and soil pH (r ≈ -0.68); drier, higher-pH plots tend to exhibit higher biomass, though pattern varies by treatment.
- Overall positive relationship between soil pH and biomass when all treatments are considered; within N or L-only plots, the relationship weakens; in N+L plots, pH can have a more complex, sometimes negative, relationship with productivity.

# Conclusions and Implications
- Management actions (mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide use) drive distinct shifts in plant community structure and productivity.
- Fertilisation reliably increases productivity, with the combination of nitrogen and lime producing the strongest response, but high pH and lowered soil moisture may eventually limit gains.
- Mowing and lack of grazing promote stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities, reducing certain aggressive grass species and increasing mosses.
- Insecticide treatment correlates with higher plant diversity, though causality remains to be conclusively established; effects likely mediated through changes in herbivory and plant survivability.
- Trampling during intensive experimental activities can confound productivity measurements in certain plots, highlighting the need to separate management effects from experimental handling.
- The CSR functional-type framework supports interpreting observed shifts: fertilised plots favor competitive strategies; unimproved plots favour stress-tolerant strategies; disturbances (grazing removal, mowing) alter disturbance regimes and drive successional trajectories.
