# Inundation results simulated by HiPIMS model for pluvial and fluvial flooding in Can Tho city, Vietnam

- Overview
  - Dataset of inundation results produced by the HiPIMS model for both pluvial and fluvial flooding in Can Tho city, Vietnam.
  - Outputs represent the maximum inundation water depth (meters) during specific flood events.

- Data collection and generation
  - Pluvial flooding results driven by design rainfall for return periods of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 years.
  - Fluvial flooding results driven by river water level boundary for the year 2011.

- Data structure and format
  - Data provided as TIFF files containing the cell-averaged maximum inundation depth.
  - Pluvial flood files: 2years.tif, 5years.tif, 10years.tif, 20years.tif, 50years.tif, 100years.tif.
  - Fluvial flood file: 2011inundationMap.tif.
  - Each file includes information about the base data resolution used.

- Quality control and validation
  - Generated using established procedures; HiPIMS has been successfully used for flood risk assessment in multiple projects.
  - Supporting references indicate validated modelling approaches.

- Provenance and context
  - Linked to a body of work validating HiPIMS for high-performance hydrodynamic modelling of floods (references below).

- Uses and value
  - Intended for flood risk assessment and policy evaluation; supports standardised environmental monitoring outputs.
  - Data structure and naming facilitate integration into maps, charts, and cross-dataset analyses.

- Accessibility and storage
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for access and reuse.
