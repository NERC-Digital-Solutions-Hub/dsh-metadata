# Supporting information

## Overview
- Describes inundation results simulated by the HiPIMS model for pluvial and fluvial flooding in Can Tho city, Vietnam.
- Pluvial flooding results are driven by design rainfall for 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100-year return periods.
- Fluvial flooding results are driven by river water level boundary for the year 2011.
- The dataset is intended to support flood risk assessment and related monitoring activities.

## Data collection and generation methods
- HiPIMS model used to simulate inundation results; model has been applied in multiple flood risk projects.
- Collection/generation relies on established modelling approaches and prior validation (citations provided).

## Data structure and content
- Data provided as TIFF files.
- Each TIFF presents the maximum inundation water depth (in meters) for a specific flood event.
- Pluvial flooding files:
  - 2years.tif, 5years.tif, 10years.tif, 20years.tif, 50years.tif, 100years.tif
- Fluvial flooding file:
  - 2011inundationMap.tif
- Files include information about base data resolution and cell-averaged maximum inundation depth.

## Quality and validation
- The HiPIMS inundation data have been developed and validated through established procedures.
- The approach aligns with prior flood risk assessments and is supported by published work.

## How this supports environmental health monitoring and policy
- Provides standardized, scenario-based inundation outputs that can feed flood risk indicators and decision-support dashboards.
- Clear drivers (return-period rainfall design for pluvial, historical river level for fluvial) enable scenario planning and trend analysis.
- Structured file naming and unit (meters) facilitate integration into monitoring frameworks and metadata should be straightforward to document for governance.
- Based on validated modelling, offering defensible inputs for risk communication, planning, and investment in flood mitigation.

## Data availability and governance considerations
- Data are provided in TIFF format with explicit naming for different flood drivers and return periods.
- Metadata coverage mentioned includes spatial resolution and cell-averaged depths, but detailed metadata practices are not exhaustively described in this document.
