# Supporting information

- This document describes inundation results simulated by the HiPIMS model for pluvial and fluvial flooding in Can Tho city, Vietnam.
- Pluvial flooding results are driven by design rainfall with return periods of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 years.
- Fluvial flooding results are driven by the river water level boundary in 2011.
- Data are provided as TIFF (.tif) files containing the maximum inundation water depth (in meters) during each flood event.
- File categories:
  - Pluvial flooding inundation results:
    - 2years.tif
    - 5years.tif
    - 10years.tif
    - 20years.tif
    - 50years.tif
    - 100years.tif
  - Fluvial flooding inundation results:
    - 2011inundationMap.tif
- Each file contains the cell-averaged maximum inundation depth and information about the base data resolution.
- Collection/generation approach:
  - HiPIMS model used to simulate inundation and support flood risk assessment.
  - Design rainfall and 2011 river boundary serve as drivers for the respective flood types.
- Quality control:
  - HiPIMS has been successfully used in multiple projects for inundation modelling.
  - Referenced prior work validating methods: Zhao & Liang (2022); Xia et al. (2019); Xing et al. (2019).

- Use case:
  - Supports flood risk assessment, comparative analysis across different return periods, and visualization of inundation extents.
  - Datasets may facilitate cross-comparison with other data sources, model validation, and scenario planning.
