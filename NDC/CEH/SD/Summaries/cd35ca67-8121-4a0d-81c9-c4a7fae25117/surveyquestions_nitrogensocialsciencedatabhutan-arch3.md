SANH WP 1.3 Harmonised Individual Questionnaire

- Purpose and scope in later sections
  - Extends environmental health monitoring by collecting livestock-related data, information sources, adoption of practices, attitudes, household economics, assets, and subsidies relevant to nitrogen management and policy scrutiny.
  - Designed for harmonised, cross-site use with consistent data structures to enable comparability and aggregation.

- Section 9: LIVESTOCK
  - Capture of ownership in last 12 months for multiple species (e.g., cattle, buffalo, yak, cattle-buffalo hybrid, goat, sheep, horse, camel, pig, poultry) with per-species detail.
  - For each species: reasons for rearing (e.g., revenue, milk, meat, transport, ceremonies, draft, dowry, etc.).
  - Per-species counts and flows: how animals left the farm in the last 12 months (sale, slaughter, gifting, etc.); and weeks spent in different housing conditions (yard, open animal house, closed animal house).
  - Identification of the species with the highest livestock units and related movement patterns.
  - Designed to quantify livestock-related inputs, outputs, and management practices that influence nitrogen management (e.g., manure production, manure handling, and potential emissions).

- Section 10: INFORMATION SOURCES
  - Attending crop demonstrations/trainings in the last 2 years; whether trainings included fertilizer and manure use.
  - How decisions on fertilizer handling and use are made (seek advice, sources of information).
  - Where information is sought (family, traders, extension agents, government, media, internet).
  - Willingness to use more information and reasons for constraints.
  - Use of decision-support tools and record-keeping for fertilizer use and yields.

- Section 11: ADOPTION - DRIVERS AND BARRIERS
  - Selected farm practices and technologies (e.g., decision support tools, green manure, agroforestry, anaerobic digestion, midseason drainage, foliar fertilization).
  - Awareness vs. current use vs. dis-adoption of practices; country-specific additions allowed.
  - Captures diffusion and adoption status to analyse barriers and incentives for uptake of nitrogen-management practices.

- Section 12: ATTITUDE, BEHAVIOUR, PERCEPTION AND OPINION
  - General openness to new technologies and risk tolerance in decision-making.
  - Perceived catalysts for changing fertilizer use and the impact of additional synthetic fertilizer or manure on harvests.
  - Attitudes toward soil and crop management, including environment, nutrition, and long-term sustainability.
  - Focus on how attitudes may drive or constrain adoption of enhanced nitrogen-management practices.

- Section 13: EXPENSES (MONTHLY)
  - Average monthly household expenditures across categories (food, clothing, education, health, taxes, festivals, durable/assets purchases, debt, utilities, etc.).
  - Distinguishes own-production food from purchased food and notes comprehensive monthly cash flow impacts on agricultural decisions.

- Section 14: HOUSEHOLD WEALTH/ASSETS
  - Housing ownership status, room count, and floor materials; lighting and cooking fuel sources; drinking water sources.
  - Household assets (TVs, smartphones, internet access, power tiller, irrigation pump) and money-transfer tools.
  - Access to credit and loans, loan sources, and distance to financial institutions.
  - Crop insurance status and potential compensation if a harvest fails; asset ownership and transport (human, animal, motorized).
  - Crop code and season code fields for linking insurance data to agricultural activities.

- Section 15: SUBSIDY
  - Direct subsidies received in the past 12 months (country-adjusted) for items such as synthetic fertilizer, agricultural machinery, irrigation charges, price support, seed, and others.
  - Enables examination of policy support and its relationship to farming practices and nitrogen-use decisions.

- Design implications for monitoring-framework authors
  - Emphasises harmonised, repeatable modules across sections to support cross-site comparison of nitrogen-related practices, inputs, outputs, and governance factors.
  - Integrates behavioral and economic dimensions with technical practices to understand adoption, decision-making, and policy impacts.
  - Balances detailed species-level livestock data with broader information on adoption, information flows, attitudes, and household context.
  - Addresses data-gathering challenges such as respondent burden, the need for per-species coding, and the importance of linking subsidy and insurance data to farming practices.
