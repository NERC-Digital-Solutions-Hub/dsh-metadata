# Variable description

- The data dictionary enumerates a comprehensive, seasonally structured set of variables for an agricultural survey, covering labor, inputs, mechanization, irrigation, crop production, pest management, livestock, information sources, and household socio-economic context.
- Context: multi-season data collection at crop/plot and household levels, with codes for crops, seasons, and management practices, enabling detailed monitoring of nitrogen use practices, input adoption, and related decisions.

## Core data domains

- Labor and workforce
  - Season-specific labor hours by activity, disaggregated by household members (HM) and hired labor (HL) across activities such as land preparation, seed/seedling sowing, weeding, planting, fertilizing, transplanting (rice), water management, harvesting, and “others.”
  - Totals for season 2, season 1, and subsequent seasons; includes wage information for each activity and season, plus total wages.
  - Gendered and aggregate labor counts (e.g., number of males and females supplied in season 2).

- Crop codes and seasonality
  - Crop codes for crops grown in each season (season 1, season 2, etc.), enabling linkage of labor, input use, and outputs to specific crops.
  - Sector-specific variables track crop-related labor, input, and mechanization across multiple seasons.
  - Mechanization and input variables linked to crop seasons (e.g., crop-specific labor, mechanization types, and costs).

- Mechanization and production practices
  - Mechanization levels for land preparation, seed sowing, fertilizer application, irrigation, and harvesting (fully mechanized, partially mechanized, or fully manual) across seasons.
  - Catalog of machinery types used (e.g., harvester, mower, paddy-specific equipment, sprinkler, drip irrigation, seed drill, etc.).
  - Costs associated with land preparation when machinery or animal power is used.

- Irrigation, water management, and costs
  - Crop- and season-specific irrigation data: access to irrigation, whether irrigation occurred, proportion of crop irrigated, water management method (e.g., flood, alternate wetting and drying, aerobic, etc.), puddling for rice, water source, water pricing mechanism, and water payments.
  - Seasonal and crop-level water costs and payment amounts.

- Inputs and pest management
  - Pesticide/herbicide use per crop/season (whether used, types of pesticides, number of applications, total cost).
  - Integrated Pest Management (IPM) uptake; pest control decisions and sources of pest guidance.

- Fertilizer decision-making and management
  - Detailed decisions on synthetic fertilizer and organic manure application, including whether decisions are based on guides, calculators, previous year, or other documents; whether written records are kept for fertilizer use and yields.
  - Repeated sets of fertilizer decisions across multiple sub-seasons (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) to capture evolving practices.
  - Information sources and trust in decision support tools; willingness to follow advice exactly versus modify it.
  - Attitudes and beliefs about fertilizer use, including perceived benefits, risks, and environmental/health considerations.

- Decision support tools and adoption
  - Exposure to and current use of decision-support tools (e.g., leaf colour charts) and other innovative practices (green manure, agroforestry, anaerobic digestion, mid-season drainage, foliar fertilizer, etc.).
  - Attitudes toward new technologies, risk tolerance, and openness to experimentation.
  - Information sources used for fertilization guidance (family/neighbours, fertilizer traders, extension agents, government, print media, radio/TV, internet).

- Information gathering and governance
  - Questions about information needs, information availability barriers, and reasons for not using more or better information on fertilizer use.
  - Data governance and metadata considerations; checks and enumerator notes for data quality, provenance, and standardization.

- Household socio-economic context
  - Asset ownership, housing characteristics, expenditures (food, electricity, fuel, transport, communications, health, education, taxes, festivals, durable assets, savings/investments, debt repayment, etc.).
  - Ownership of productive assets (land, livestock, irrigation equipment, transport) and access to services (electricity, internet).
  - Access to credit and proximity to financial institutions; crop insurance status; subsidies received (synthetic fertilizer, machinery, irrigation, output support, seeds, others).

- Additional contextual indicators
  - Attitudes and personalities relevant to technology adoption, risk tolerance, soil and weather interactions, and environmental concerns.
  - Enumerator notes and metadata fields for data collection context and timing (start/end dates and times).

## Data quality and governance considerations for monitoring frameworks

- Data granularity and scope
  - Rich, multi-season, household- and plot-level data enabling tracking of input choices, labor allocation, mechanization, irrigation, and production outcomes across crops and seasons.
  - Cross-variable linkages (labor hours, wages, mechanization, input use, yields, costs) facilitate multi-dimensional indicators of input intensity and adoption.

- Metadata and standardization
  - Extensive variable descriptions exist, with metadata governance and public-sharing considerations noted as needing formalization for transparency and reuse.
  - Standardized coding (e.g., crop codes, season codes, irrigation and mechanization categories) supports data interoperability and cross-agency data sharing.

- Data provenance and governance
  - Emphasis on data provenance, data cleaning, and data sharing policies; attention to potential silos within and between organizations.
  - Data structure supports monitoring indicators tied to policy questions (e.g., subsidy impacts, fertilizer choice, adoption drivers, labor dynamics).

- Practical considerations for monitoring
  - Requires consistent data collection practices across enumerators, robust QA (spot checks, back checks, and data-transfer verifications), and clear documentation of variable definitions.
  - Public data sharing may be constrained by sensitivities around labor, costs, and farm practices, necessitating governance frameworks that balance transparency with privacy.

## Implications for monitoring indicators and policy analysis

- Enables indicators on:
  - Labor allocation: HM vs HL contributions per season and activity, wage structures, and gender distribution.
  - Input intensity and economics: synthetic vs organic fertilizer use, input costs, subsidies, and their seasonal dynamics.
  - Mechanization and productivity: levels of mechanization, machinery types, and associated costs across tasks and crops.
  - Water and irrigation management: access, usage patterns, water pricing, and related expenditures.
  - Adoption and information pathways: uptake of decision-support tools, sources of information, and adoption beliefs versus actual practices.
  - Fertilizer decision processes: decision aids, guidance usage, and record-keeping practices.
  - Household welfare and assets: linkages between agricultural practices and household expenditures, assets, credit access, and insurance.

- Supports policy evaluation
  - Assessment of subsidy effectiveness (fertilizer, irrigation, machinery) and its influence on adoption and productivity.
  - Evaluation of information dissemination effectiveness and barriers to information access.
  - Insight into data governance needs to improve data sharing, interoperability, and long-term monitoring capacity.
