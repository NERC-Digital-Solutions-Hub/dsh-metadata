# Harmonised Household Survey Data for NUE and Sustainable Nitrogen Practices (SANH WP 1.3)

## Aim and scope
- Data collected to assess differences in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and sustainable nitrogen practices among households.
- Focus on understanding farmers’ attitudes, opinions, and decision-making affecting NUE in crop production and farm-related factors enabling adoption of sustainable practices.
- Part of the SANH Harmonised Household Survey (WPs 1.3) for cross-country comparability (Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka).

## Data structure and coverage
- Large, multi-domain dataset organized into 15 sections:
  - Household Characteristics
  - General Farm Characteristics
  - Plot Characteristics
  - Crop Production & Harvest
  - Synthetic & Organic Fertilizer Use & Compost Production
  - Labour
  - Irrigation
  - Pesticides
  - Livestock
  - Information Sources
  - Adoption – Drivers and Barriers
  - Attitude, Behaviour, Perception and Opinion
  - Household Expenditure & Income
  - Household Asset/Wealth
  - Subsidy
- Captures extensive variables across:
  - Land ownership, land size, tenancy; cropping areas by season; crop codes and crop-specific details.
  - Seed/ planting material: crop codes, varieties, sources, quantities, costs.
  - Fertilizers: synthetic and organic use, types, quantities, subsidies, sources, costs, application, timing; season-specific fertilizer data.
  - Compost/organic matter: production processes and use.
  - Labour: time use by household members vs hired labour across activities; wages; gender distribution.
  - Output/economics: crop harvests by season, sales, revenue, losses, residues.
  - Inputs/practices: irrigation timing, pesticides, information sources, adoption drivers/barriers.
  - Mechanization: level and costs; equipment types and usage across crops and seasons.
  - Information/decision-making: sources, guidance/tools, and decision-support adoption (e.g., leaf colour charts, DSS).
  - Attitudes and perceptions: risk tolerance, beliefs about fertilizer/manure, soil health, environmental considerations.
  - Livestock and assets: ownership, purpose, movement, income generation.
  - Expenditure/income and subsidies: monthly/annual expenditure categories; subsidy receipt (synthetic fertilizer, irrigation, seeds, machinery, etc.).
- Data are designed for cross-season analysis (season 1 and season 2) and cross-country harmonisation.

## Temporal design and cross-country harmonisation
- Data collected over two seasons to enable cross-season analyses and comparisons within the SANH Harmonised framework.
- Variables are coded with season-specific suffixes (e.g., S11, S12, S21, S22, S23, etc.) to distinguish season and crop-specific records.
- Aims to support cross-country comparability and cumulative analyses across markets and practices.

## Analytical opportunities for Analysts
- Identify correlations and drivers of NUE and adoption of sustainable nitrogen practices at household and plot levels.
- Build predictive models linking labour inputs, fertilizer use, irrigation, mechanization, and pest management to NUE outcomes and yields.
- Compare adoption drivers/barriers across regions and crops; evaluate impact of information sources and decision-support tools.
- Assess season-to-season variability in inputs, practices, and outcomes; examine subsidy effectiveness and access to irrigation.
- Inform policy and extension strategies by revealing how information access, risk attitudes, and farm characteristics influence fertilizer decisions and NUE.

## Data quality, standards, and accessibility
- Multi-layered quality checks:
  - Supervisors’ spot checks; paper data verification; back checks; data-transfer checks; enumerator notes.
- Provenance tracking and metadata intended; datasets designed to be discoverable via data portals.
- Harmonised framework supports consistent analysis across countries and seasons.

## Practical considerations and challenges
- Common analyst challenges in data-intensive work:
  - Lack of data at local scales; data access barriers; unstandardised datasets.
  - Datasets often known only within specific academic or closed circles; difficulty locating relevant data.
  - Challenges unifying data from multiple sources/formats; variable quality and divergent scales.
  - Public-health and privacy considerations; IT barriers; heavy computational demands of large datasets.
  - Ensuring robust analysis requires careful data cleaning, harmonisation, and documentation due to complex, multi-crop, multi-season structure.

## Example variable themes (representative)
- Labour: hours spent by household members vs hired labour on various activities (e.g., land preparation, seed sowing, weeding, planting, fertilizing, transplanting, water management, harvesting) across seasons; season-specific wage data; total labour counts.
- Mechanization and costs: levels of mechanization for land preparation, sowing, fertilizer application, irrigation, harvesting; types of machinery used; costs when machinery or animal power is employed.
- Irrigation and water management: access to irrigation, water pricing mechanisms, source of irrigation water, volumes paid, crop-specific irrigation practices, rice-specific water management (flooding, drainage, puddling).
- Fertilizers and manure: synthetic and organic fertilizer use, quantities, subsidies, sources; decision-making processes for fertilizer use; records kept; trials and use of decision-support tools; manure management and perceived benefits.
- Pesticides: usage by crop and season; types (farm-made vs manufactured); frequency and cost; adoption of IPM.
- Information and adoption: sources of guidance (government, extension, traders, media, internet); willingness to adopt new practices; use of decision-support tools; training attendance.
- Attitudes and perceptions: beliefs about soil fertility, yield response to fertilizer, environmental impacts, risk tolerance, and willingness to experiment with new practices.
- Household economics and assets: expenditure patterns (food, utilities, education, health, tax, festivals, durable assets); asset ownership (land, house, equipment); credit and loan access; crop insurance; subsidies received.
- Livestock and farm diversification: species owned, reasons for keeping livestock, changes in ownership and movements.
- Subsidies: receipt of direct subsidies for synthetic fertilizer, agricultural machinery, irrigation charges, output price supports, seeds, and others.
