# SANH WP 1.3 Harmonised Individual Questionnaire

## SECTION 9: LIVESTOCK
- Records ownership of animal species for at least 1 month in the past 12 months; species include Cattle, Buffalo, Cattle-buffalo hybrid, Yak, Goat, Sheep, Camel, Horse, Pig, Poultry (and others via country-specific additions).
- For each species: reasons for keeping (e.g., generate revenue, milk for home/sales, meat for home, festivals/dowry, transport, animal power/draft, coping with revenue fluctuations, etc.).
- For each species: count of animals (per species) and transitions out of the farm (e.g., sale, barter, slaughter for sale, household use, illness, given away, theft, old age/natural death, disease).
- For the species with the highest livestock units on the farm: how animals left the farm in the last 12 months and how many weeks they spent across different housing settings (yard, open animal house, closed animal house) during the past year.
- Repeated structure across multiple species (e.g., Cattle, Buffalo, Cattle-buffalo hybrid, Yak, Goat, Sheep, Camel, Horse, Pig, Poultry) to capture dynamics of livestock composition and management.

## SECTION 10: INFORMATION SOURCES
- 10.1–10.2 Exposure to crop demonstrations/trainings in the last 2 years; whether trainings covered fertilizer and manure use and management.
- 10.3-10.5 Decision-making and information-seeking: whether decision-making on fertiliser handling involved seeking help, and preferred information sources ranked by importance (family/neighbours, fertilizer traders, extension agents, government, print media, radio/TV, internet, others).
- 10.6-10.7 Use of guidance/tools for fertilisation and whether advice is followed exactly or modified.
- 10.8 How decisions on fertilizer/manure quantities are made (multiple-choice prompts including past year amounts, guidance documents, calculators, amount available, and other reasons).
- 10.9-10.10 Record-keeping: whether written records of fertilizer use and yield/harvest are kept.

## SECTION 11: ADOPTION - DRIVERS AND BARRIERS
- Practice IDs cover several technologies/practices (e.g., decision support tools like leaf colour charts; green manure; agroforestry; anaerobic digestion; midseason drainage; foliar fertiliser; and country-specific practices).
- 11.1–11.3 Assess awareness, current use, and adoption/dis-adoption status for each listed practice.
- Allows country-specific additions to capture locally relevant practices.

## SECTION 12: ATTITUDE, BEHAVIOUR, PERCEPTION AND OPINION
- 12.1–12.2 Personal disposition toward new technologies and risk tolerance (scale 0 to 5).
- 12.3–12.4 Questions about what could drive changes in synthetic/organic fertiliser use (and quantity referenced).
- 12.4 Belief statements about the harvest impact of applying more fertilizer/manure (scale 0–5) and whether there is no limit to the advantage of adding more fertilizer/manure (scale 1–5).
- 12.6 Whether manure application considers prior synthetic fertilizer use (yes/no).
- 12.7–12.9 Series of statements about soil management, soil fertility, environmental considerations, and the perceived trade-offs of manure vs. synthetic fertilizer (multiple prompts and sub-items to capture nuanced attitudes).

## SECTION 13: EXPENDITURES
- Monthly expense profiling across categories, including:
  - Average food cost (including own production and purchases).
  - Clothing, education, health, taxes, festivals, social expenditures, investment in durable assets, repairs, savings/debt, and other miscellaneous items.
- Structure allows capturing household cash-flow, coping capacity, and investment behavior.

## SECTION 14: HOUSEHOLD WEALTH/ASSET
- Household dwelling ownership: own, rent, or partial ownership; number of rooms; floor material; lighting sources; cooking fuel; drinking water source.
- Asset ownership: televisions, smartphones, internet access; power tiller; irrigation pumps; use of mobile/online money transfers; transport modes (human-, animal-, motor-powered).
- Credit and finance: past-year farm investment loans, loan accessibility, and distance to financial institutions.
- Crop insurance: presence and season of insurance; potential compensation in case of crop failure.
- 14.17: inclusion of country-specific fields for crop code and season code.

## SECTION 15: SUBSIDY
- Direct subsidies received in the past 12 months, with categories including synthetic fertilizer, agricultural machinery purchases, irrigation charges, output price support, seed, and other subsidies.
- Each subsidy category captured with yes/no indicators to assess distribution and impact.

 Data use implications (Analysts perspective)
- Enables analysis of livestock composition, flows, and housing dynamics to understand production risk and resilience.
- Supports modeling of information channels and adoption pathways for fertiliser practices and related technologies.
- Facilitates correlation of attitudes and risk tolerance with adoption and intensity of fertilizer/manure use.
- Provides insight into household economics, expenditure patterns, assets, and subsidy exposure to evaluate policy impact and financial vulnerability.
- Cross-country harmonised structure with country-specific extensions allows comparative analysis and targeted policy recommendations.
