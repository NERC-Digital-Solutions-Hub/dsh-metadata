# SANH WP 1.3 Harmonised Individual Questionnaire

## Overview of Sections 9–15 (LIVESTOCK to SUBSIDY)

- The following sections collect household-level data to support environmental monitoring through livestock management, fertilizer decision-making, technology adoption, attitudes toward soil and crop practices, and financial/policy context.
- Data are designed to enable linking on-farm practices to environmental outcomes such as nutrient cycling, manure management, irrigation efficiency, and policy effects over time.

## Section 9: LIVESTOCK

- Species owned (examples: Cattle, Buffalo, Yak, Goat, Sheep, Horse, Camel, Pig, Poultry; includes hybrids) and for how long (minimum 1 month in past 12 months).
- For each species: primary reasons for keeping (e.g., generate revenue, milk for home/sales, meat for home consumption, ceremonial/dowry, transport, draft/animal power).
- For the species with the highest livestock units: how animals leave the farm (sale, slaughter, given away, etc.) and duration spent in different housing arrangements (yard, open animal house, closed animal house) over the past 12 months.
- Collects counts per species and patterns of livestock movement to infer manure availability, nutrient cycling potential, and grazing pressure.

## Section 10: INFORMATION SOURCES

- Training and demonstrations: whether the respondent attended crop demonstrations/trainings in the last 2 years; whether trainings covered fertilizer and manure use.
- Decision-making inputs: who or what sources are used for fertilizer decisions (family/neighbours, extension agents, government, print media, internet, etc.).
- Use of guidance/tools: whether decision-support tools or guidance documents are used; interest in and access to tools (e.g., leaf color charts, soil tests, calculators).
- Information-seeking behavior: where information is sought when issues arise (extension, traders, family, government, media, internet).
- Barriers and records: reasons for not using more information; whether written records of fertilizer use and yields are kept.

## Section 11: ADOPTION – DRIVERS AND BARRIERS

- Practices/technologies tracked (e.g., decision support tools, green manure, agroforestry, anaerobic digestion of livestock waste, midseason drainage, foliar fertilizer; country-specific additions).
- For each practice: whether heard about, currently used, and whether ever dis-adopted.
- Captures adoption status, exposure, and potential barriers or enablers to uptake of environmental/agro-nutrient management practices.

## Section 12: ATTITUDE, BEHAVIOUR, PERCEPTION AND OPINION

- General openness to new technologies: willingness to try innovations on crops and soils.
- Risk tolerance in decision-making: appetite for decisions that could lose money but potentially gain.
- Key questions on what could change fertilizer use (quantity decisions) and perceived benefits/risks of synthetic fertilizers vs manure.
- Perceptions of fertilizer and manure effects on soil fertility, yields, environmental outcomes, and trade-offs (e.g., runoff, soil health).
- Attitudes towards soil management and the role of weather and environmental considerations in management choices.
- Importance placed on manure for farm productivity and alternative uses of manure within the household.

## Section 13: EXPENSES (Monthly)

- Average monthly expenditures across broad categories: food (including own production), clothing, education, health, taxes, festivals/social expenditures, durable assets, debt repayment, and other utilities.
- Provides economic context that influences investment capacity in inputs, adoption of practices, and resilience.

## Section 14: HOUSEHOLD WEALTH/ASSET

- Housing and living conditions: home ownership status, number of rooms, floor material, lighting, fuel for cooking, drinking water source.
- Assets and connectivity: number of televisions, smartphones, internet access, power tiller, irrigation pump, and transport ownership (human, animal, or motor-powered).
- Financial access and risk management: access to loans for farm investments, distance to financial institutions, crop insurance, and crop insurance in-season.
- Indicates capacity to invest in inputs, inputs efficiency, and resilience against environmental shocks.

## Section 15: SUBSIDY

- Direct subsidies received in the past 12 months (country-adjusted categories): synthetic fertilizer, agricultural machinery, irrigation charges, output price support, seed, and other subsidies.
- Enables assessment of policy exposure and potential effects on input use, adoption, and environmental outcomes.

## How this data supports environmental monitoring

- Nutrient inputs and management
  - Section 9 provides manure generation potential and nutrient supply from livestock; Section 10 and Section 15 tie fertilizer inputs and subsidies to nitrogen application decisions.
- Production practices and environmental risk
  - Section 11 captures adoption of nutrient-management practices and related technologies, informing uptake barriers and policy effectiveness.
  - Section 12 sheds light on attitudes driving management choices that impact soil health and runoff risk.
- Resource access and resilience
  - Sections 13–14 detail household wealth and asset access, which influence ability to invest in sustainable practices and adapt to environmental changes.
- Policy and governance context
  - Section 15 subsidies enable analysis of how policy instruments shape input use patterns and associated environmental pressures.
- Data quality and harmonization
  - The questionnaire follows harmonised design principles for cross-country comparability and longitudinal analysis, with standardized prompts and data-custody/verification practices to improve reliability.

## Considerations for interpretation

- Self-reported data may be affected by recall bias and country/season-specific adaptations; cross-checks and harmonised coding help mitigate comparability issues.
- The environmental indicators derived from these sections rely on linking livestock manure, fertilizer decisions, adopted practices, and subsidy exposure to measurable environmental outcomes (e.g., nutrient balances, runoff risk, soil health) over time.
