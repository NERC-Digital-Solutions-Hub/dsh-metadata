# SANH WP 1.3 Harmonised Individual Questionnaire

- Purpose and scope
  - Harmonised survey instrument for the South Asian Nitrogen Hub to improve nitrogen management in agriculture and understand environmental impacts.
  - Collects household demographics, farm characteristics, livestock data, information sources, adoption drivers/barriers, attitudes, expenditures, assets, and subsidies.
  - Enables end-to-end data capture (household to farm level) with harmonised elements for cross-country comparability and longitudinal analysis.
  - Emphasises consent, confidentiality, and data use strictly for research.

- Respondents and data collection context
  - Respondent: household member (often the head or a suitable adult); enumerators from partner institutions.
  - Informed consent obtained; participation voluntary; data verification possible; confidentiality maintained.
  - Data collection designed to support cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses across diverse contexts.

- Section 9: Livestock
  - Species owned for at least 1 month in the past 12 months (multiple species allowed): includes cattle, buffalo, yak, cattle-buffalo hybrid, goat, sheep, horse, camel, pig, poultry (and other specified species).
  - For each species: reasons for keeping (e.g., revenue, milk, meat, ceremonies, draught/animal power, transport, dowry, etc.).
  - For each species: counts (livestock units) and how animals leave the farm in the past 12 months (sale, barter, slaughter, gifts, illness, theft, natural death).
  - For the most represented species on the farm: weeks spent in different housing (yard, open animal house, closed animal house).
  - Repeated and detailed prompts support precise counting and housing duration data.

- Section 10: Information Sources
  - Attended crop demonstrations/training in last 2 years; whether trainings covered fertilizer and manure management.
  - Decision-making sources for fertiliser use (family, traders, extension, government, media, internet, etc.).
  - Barriers to using more or better information; use of guidance tools (government guidelines, private company guidelines, computer programs, apps, leaf colour charts, soil tests).
  - Whether decisions follow guidance or are modified; reasons for choosing specific information and methods.
  - Written records of fertilizer use and yield kept for target crops.

- Section 11: Adoption — Drivers and Barriers
  - Selected practices/technologies related to farm management and nitrogen management (e.g., decision support tools, green manure, agroforestry, anaerobic digestion, midseason drainage, foliar fertilisation).
  - For each practice: awareness, current use, and dis-adoption (if any).
  - Country-specific placeholders allow inclusion of additional practices.

- Section 12: Attitude, Behaviour, Perception and Opinion
  - General attitude toward technology adoption (openness to trying new technologies).
  - Risk tolerance in decision-making (0–5 scale).
  - Key questions on what could change fertilizer use practices and how much fertilizer/manure is believed to impact harvest outcomes.
  - Perceptions of fertilizer vs. manure effects on soil fertility, environmental considerations, yield, storage, handling, and health.
  - Attitudes about the limits of fertilizer/manure benefits and how current application interacts with weather and environment.

- Section 13: Household Expenditure
  - Average monthly expenses across categories (food, clothing, education, health, utilities, transport, communication, festivals, debt, savings, etc.).
  - Expenditures include both own-production consumption and purchased goods; space for other items.

- Section 14: Household Wealth/Asset
  - Home ownership (full/partial) and characteristics (rooms, floor material, lighting, cooking fuel, drinking water source).
  - Asset ownership (TVs, smartphones, internet access, power tiller, irrigation pump, money transfer via mobile/computer, transport modes).
  - Access to credit (loans for farm investments), loan sources, and distance to financial institutions.
  - Crop insurance status and season; crop codes and season codes for insurance and other agronomic data.
  - Additional notes on crop insurance compensation if harvest fails.

- Section 15: Subsidy
  - Direct subsidies received in past 12 months (country-adjusted).
  - Categories include: synthetic fertilizer, agricultural machinery purchase, irrigation charges, output price support, seeds, and others.
  - Yes/No follow-up for each subsidy category.

- Data governance, quality, and ethics
  - Informed consent obtained; participation voluntary; confidentiality maintained.
  - Data used for research; paper records may be destroyed after completion; respondents may be contacted for verification.
  - Standardized data elements and codes promote cross-study comparability; longitudinal and cross-sectional design supports tracking changes over time.
  - Requires robust metadata, data dictionary, and variable definitions to support cross-country analyses and data integration.

- Implications and value for Data Leaders
  - Comprehensive, harmonised dataset spanning household to farm-level data supports evaluation of nitrogen management practices, input efficiency, and environmental impact across networks.
  - Enables co-ownership and user-centric product development by aligning data collection with user needs (policy, extension, researchers).
  - Enhances data discovery and interoperability through standardized metadata, codes (e.g., subsidy, livestock species, inputs), and season identifiers.
  - Facilitates data integration across partners and networks while underscoring governance, privacy, and long-term storage needs.
  - Highlights requirements for ongoing data quality processes, documentation, and training to ensure consistency across respondents, regions, and seasons.

- Practical considerations for implementation
  - Ensure robust consent and data privacy documentation; provide clear participant contact information.
  - Maintain a detailed data dictionary and metadata repository to support standardization and cross-study comparability.
  - Plan data management workflows to handle multi-section data, seasonal references, and long-form responses.
  - Implement data validation, cleaning, and verification routines (e.g., cross-checking totals, units, crop codes).
  - Align with wider data ecosystem goals (e.g., nitrogen management research) by producing usable data products for policy analysis, modelling, and stakeholder reporting.

- Endnotes
  - Instrument designed for flexibility across diverse national contexts while maintaining harmonised data elements for aggregated analyses.
  - Integrates demographic, agronomic, economic, and attitudinal dimensions to enable a holistic view of nitrogen management practices and their impacts.
