# SANH WP 1.3 Harmonised Individual Questionnaire

- Purpose and scope
  - Harmonised household survey instrument to improve nitrogen management in agriculture by collecting data on household demographics, farming activity, inputs, outputs, and practices.
  - Designed to support cross-topic data use and enable data products for end users; suitable for diverse organisations (e.g., local councils, private companies).

- Key data domains covered in the included sections
  - Section 9: Livestock
    - For each owned species (e.g., Cattle, Buffalo, Yak, Goat, Sheep, Horse, Camel, Pig, Poultry, and hybrids), collect:
      - Reasons for keeping (e.g., revenue, milk, meat, ceremonies, transport, draft, etc.).
      - Number of animals per species.
      - How animals left the farm in the past 12 months (sale, slaughter, given away, etc.).
      - Weeks animals spent in different housing arrangements (yards, open houses, closed houses).
      - For the species with the highest number of livestock units, repeat 9.5–9.7 prompts.
  - Section 10: Information Sources
    - Attendance at crop demonstrations/trainings in the last 2 years.
    - Whether trainings covered fertilizer/manure use; sources of information; advice-seeking behavior; and information-source preferences (family, traders, extension agents, government, media, internet, etc.).
    - Use of decision aids or tools (leaf colour charts, soil tests, apps, calculators).
    - Practices for recording fertilizer use and yield data; decision processes for fertilizer quantities.
  - Section 11: Adoption – Drivers and Barriers
    - List of general farm practices/technologies (e.g., leaf colour charts, green manures, agroforestry, anaerobic digestion, midseason drainage, foliar fertilization, guidance tools).
    - Questions on awareness, current use, and dis-adoption history.
  - Section 12: Attitude, Behaviour, Perception and Opinion
    - General attitude toward technology adoption (risk-taking propensity, novelty acceptance).
    - Perceived factors that could change fertilizer usage (quantity decisions, guidance documents/tools, previous-year references).
    - Beliefs about the effects of synthetic fertilizer vs manure on harvests and soil fertility.
    - Attitudes toward soil and crop management practices, including environmental and nutritional considerations, and willingness to change practices based on financial incentives.
  - Section 13: Household Expenditure
    - Average monthly expenses across categories (food, clothing, education, health, utilities, transportation, festivals, debt, savings, etc.).
    - Includes an explicit note that food cost includes both own-production and purchases.
  - Section 14: Household Wealth/Assets
    - Home ownership status, number of rooms, floor material, lighting and cooking fuels, water source, number of TVs and smartphones, internet access.
    - Asset ownership (power tiller, irrigation pump, money transfer via mobile/computer).
    - Transport ownership (human-, animal-, motor-powered).
    - Access to credit and loan history, distance to financial institutions, crop insurance status and season.
  - Section 15: Subsidy
    - Receipt of direct subsidies in the past 12 months for categories such as synthetic fertilizer, agricultural machinery, irrigation charges, price support, seeds, and others (country-adjusted).

- Data capture and quality considerations
  - Standardised codes and units (e.g., counts, weeks, monetary values) to support cross-topic analysis.
  - Designed to capture multiple species per household with repeat prompts for each, ensuring consistency when more than one species is present.
  - Long recall windows (e.g., past 12 months) and seasonal prompts require careful training to minimize recall bias.
  - Emphasis on data for self-service outputs and cross-topic analyses (e.g., links between livestock, input use, household economics, and nitrogen management).

- Practical implications for data support
  - Enables integrated analyses of inputs (fertilizers and manures), livestock-related nutrient cycling, labor, expenditures, and subsidies.
  - Supports development of dashboards and reports that let end users explore data across topics (household economics, farm practices, and nutrient management).
  - Requires analysts to align country-specific practices, season codes, and crop/livestock taxonomies, with attention to potential data gaps and varying formats.

- Key considerations for analysts and implementers
  - Ensure consistent species coding, season reference points, and cross-country alignment for subsidies and inputs.
  - Cross-validate subsidy data with price/market data where relevant.
  - Leverage livestock and input-use data to assess nitrogen management implications, including manure use and synthetic fertilizer reliance.
  - Address potential gender and labor productivity insights through sections on livestock management, labor allocation, and mechanization.
