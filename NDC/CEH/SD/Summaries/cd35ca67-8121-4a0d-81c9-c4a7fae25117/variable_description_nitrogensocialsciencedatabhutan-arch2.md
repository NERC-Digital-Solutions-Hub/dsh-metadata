# DESCRIPTION

- Purpose and aim
  - Assess differences in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and sustainable nitrogen practices among farming households.
  - Understand farmer attitudes, opinions, and decision-making affecting NUE and related farm practices.

- Scope and structure
  - Part of the SANH Harmonised Household Survey framework.
  - Covers a broad range of topics through sectioned data collection (Household characteristics, general farm characteristics, plot characteristics, crop production and harvest, fertilizers (synthetic and organic) and compost, labour, irrigation, pesticides, livestock, information sources, adoption drivers and barriers, attitudes and perceptions, expenditures and assets, subsidies, etc.).
  - Highly granular, season- and crop-specific data designed for cross-country harmonisation across Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

- Context and design
  - Cross-sectional, in-person survey conducted across two seasons per year.
  - Sampling units include households and individuals; data collected per household, plot, and crop.
  - Part of a broader harmonised framework enabling cross-country comparisons and longitudinal-like analyses within and across seasons.

- Environmental monitoring relevance
  - Captures: fertilizer choice (synthetic vs organic), subsidy effects, timing and method of application, and interaction with irrigation.
  - Includes soil and plot management (tillage, soil cultivation, slope, fallow/non-cropping areas), crop residues, compost production, and organic inputs to assess nutrient cycling and soil health.
  - Documents information flows, adoption dynamics, and policy context essential for evaluating environmental health and policy performance.

- Key data components for environment-focused analysis
  - Fertilizer and nutrient management
    - Types of fertilizers, subsidised vs non-subsidised use, quantities, sources, application timing and methods.
    - Organic inputs, compost, and manure usage; decision-making around synthetic vs organic inputs.
    - Substantial emphasis on adoption drivers, guidance sources, information-seeking behavior, and responsive management decisions.
  - Irrigation and water management
    - Irrigation access, sources, pricing mechanisms, water payments, and crop-specific irrigation practices (including rice-specific water management methods).
  - Labour and mechanization
    - Season-by-season hours spent on labour activities by household members and hired labour (land preparation, seed/seedling sowing, weeding, planting, fertilizing, transplanting for rice, water management, harvesting, and other activities).
    - Wages by activity and total labour, gender-disaggregated labour data, and detailed mechanization levels across different activities and seasons.
  - Crop and soil management indicators
    - Plot- and crop-level indicators, land-preparation costs, machinery usage, seed types, crop codes, and yield-related data linked to NUE considerations.
    - Soil and crop management practices that influence NUE and environmental outcomes (tillage type, residue management, soil health practices, fertilization timing and method).
  - Pesticides and integrated practices
    - Use of pesticides/herbicides, types (farm-made vs manufactured), frequency and cost, and integration with pest management strategies (IPM).
  - Information and decision support
    - Information sources, adoption drivers/barriers, exposure to decision-support tools (e.g., leaf colour charts), and respondent attitudes toward new technologies and fertilizer management.
  - Livestock and agricultural diversification
    - Livestock holdings, species, purpose (income, milk, meat, power, etc.), and related management practices that can influence farm nutrient cycles and land use.
  - Household economics and subsidies
    - Expenditures, asset ownership, subsidy receipt categories (synthetic fertilizer subsidies, machinery subsidies, irrigation subsidies, output price support, seed subsidies, etc.).

- Data quality, harmonisation, and usage
  - Includes extensive quality-control measures (supervisor spot checks, 100% paper checks, back checks, and partner-institute verifications) to ensure data accuracy.
  - Designed for cross-country harmonisation within the SANH framework, enabling cross-country comparisons and aggregation.
  - Rich, longitudinally-relevant dataset (two-season cross-sectional design within a year) suitable for monitoring environmental health, NUE trends, and policy impact over time.

- Practical uses for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Track NUE-related practices and adoption trends over time and across seasons.
  - Evaluate environmental impacts of fertilizer subsidies and policy interventions.
  - Compare environmental health indicators across households, plots, crops, and seasons.
  - Map relationships between information sources, attitudes, and actual NUE practices.
  - Link agricultural practices to outcomes such as yields, incomes, and environmental footprints.
  - Support cross-country policy evaluation and harmonised analyses of nutrient management and soil health.

- Endnotes on scope
  - Data span is extensive and multilayered, from household to plot-level details across multiple seasons.
  - While centered on NUE and sustainable nitrogen practices, it encompasses broader environmental and socio-economic variables.
  - The two-season cross-sectional design supports temporal comparisons within the same year, with harmonisation enabling international analyses.
