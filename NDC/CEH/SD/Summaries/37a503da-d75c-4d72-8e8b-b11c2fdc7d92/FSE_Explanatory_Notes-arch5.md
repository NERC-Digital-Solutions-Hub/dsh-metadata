# Explanatory notes

- The Farm Scale Evaluations (FSE) were set up to determine whether genetically-modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops might have significant effects on farmland wildlife due to management practices.
- The study covers four crops: Beet, Maize, Spring-sown Oilseed Rape, and Winter-sown Oilseed Rape.
- Data collected span multiple domains:
  - Seedbank: seedbank counts from soil before planting, plus follow-up samples at 1 year and 2 years after initial sampling.
  - Vegetation in the crop: multiple surveys including First-seedling, Post-herbicide, Final Counts, Biomass, Seed Rain, and Follow-ups; with Crop-specific nuances (e.g., Mezzanine surveys in Beet and Winter Rape).
  - Field edge vegetation: Margin Attributes and related metrics (Edge Veg Cover, Flower, Seed, Bare Ground, Spray Damage) around field boundaries.
  - Invertebrates: monthly Bee and Butterfly transects (Pollinators), Crop Pests, Gastropods (Search and Trap), Pitfall, and Vortis counts in the verge and crop.
  - Additional tables: crop drilling dates, herbicide applications, and height/cover of weeds and crops.
- Data are systematically named using a consistent convention (e.g., sum_b_seedrain for Beet seedrain; sum_b_early_pitfall for Beet early-season pitfall).
- Generic table properties:
  - Each row represents half-field totals (counts/biomass/mean percent cover) for a single site.
  - Group totals and species-level contributions are stored.
  - Sites are referenced within Defra regions; South-eastern and Eastern England regions are aggregated for confidentiality.
  - Nulls appear where data were not collected; some counts may include decimals due to partial transects.
- Specific table properties:
  - All crop_pest tables use a suffix indicating winged/wingless status with W+ or W-.
- Column headings and data elements:
  - conv_count, conv_count_FL, conv_count_GE4TL, conv_count_L4TL, conv_count_SE (conventional crop counts by category)
  - gm_count, gm_count_FL, gm_count_GE4TL, gm_count_L4TL, gm_count_SE (GMHT crop counts by category)
  - crop_cover (percent cover of crop), crop_unit (C = conventional, GM = GM crop)
  - crop_height (crop height in cm)
  - name (species or group name)
  - site_ref (site reference, consistent across tables)
  - Region (Defra government region or aggregate)
  - VEG/ARTHROPOD/GASTROPOD/BB_BRC codes (coding for records)
  - weed_cover_pc (percent cover of non-crop vegetation)

## Dataset Descriptions

- Seedbank
  - Seedbank counts from soil samples taken before planting.
  - Follow-ups: Seedbank Follow-up 1 (one year after initial), Seedbank Follow-up 2 (two years after initial).
- Vegetation in the crop
  - First-seedling: first vegetation survey before herbicide application.
  - Mezzanine (Beet and Winter Rape): additional vegetation survey between herbicide applications on conventional vs GM sides.
  - Post-herbicide: vegetation survey after herbicide application on both sides.
  - Final Counts: vegetation survey concurrent with biomass sampling just before harvest.
  - Biomass: weed biomass sampled in the crop a month before harvest.
  - Seed Rain: seeds collected throughout the growing season.
  - Follow-up 1 and Follow-up 2: vegetation surveys at one year and two years after the trial crop.
- Field edge vegetation
  - Margin Attributes: physical features around the trial field edge.
  - Edge Veg Cover: percent cover of non-crop vegetation in June.
  - Edge Veg Flower: plant flowering activity (April–August).
  - Edge Veg Seed: seed setting in July–August.
  - Edge Bare Ground: percent bare ground.
  - Edge Spray Damage: vegetation damage from spraying.
- Invertebrates
  - Bee and Butterfly transects: monthly counts April–August in crop and margins; combined as Pollinators.
  - Crop Pests: herbivores on the crop early and late in the season.
  - Gastropod Search: gastropods in the field margin.
  - Gastropod Trap: gastropods trapped in the crop (spring and autumn).
  - Pitfall: counts of surface-active invertebrates (early, mid, late).
  - Vortis: arthropods on plants (early and late); sampling in field verge and crop.
- Additional tables
  - Date drilled, Herbicides applied, Height/Cover of weeds and crop.
- Data structure and referencing
  - Table naming follows the sum_<crop>_<date>_<protocol> convention.
  - Site_ref ties together data across tables; regions may be aggregated for confidentiality.
  - Data capture includes explicit notes on nulls, decimals, and the proportion-based calculation method for some transect-derived counts.

## Data Stewardship considerations for this dataset

- Metadata and data dictionary
  - Maintain explicit definitions for all fields (e.g., conv_count categories, gm_count categories, crop_unit, region codes, codes for VEG/ARTHROPOD/GASTROPOD/BB_BRC).
  - Document timing, protocol variations (e.g., Mezzanine surveys), and adjustments by crop.
- Data quality and completeness
  - Track missing data with clear null indicators; document reasons (e.g., not collected, access issues).
  - Capture decimal counts arising from partial transects and ensure provenance of calculations.
- Standardization and interoperability
  - Preserve naming conventions and coding schemes to enable cross-study integration (e.g., consistent site_ref and region mappings).
  - Ensure alignment with Defra region classifications and any confidentiality constraints.
- Provenance and governance
  - Record who collected data, at what dates, and under which protocols; reference external publications for context.
  - Manage access controls and aggregation rules for regional data to protect confidentiality (e.g., aggregated regions).
- Data sharing and publication
  - Prepare comprehensive dataset description, data dictionaries, and example queries to support reuse.
  - Link datasets to related publications (e.g., Phil. Trans. R. Soc., Proc. R. Soc. B) to support interpretation.
- Provider and portal considerations
  - Ensure datasets are uploaded to appropriate portals/catalogues with stable identifiers.
  - Establish procedures for updates, versioning, and maintaining cross-table consistency over time.
