# Explanatory notes The Farm Scale Evaluations (FSE)

- Purpose and scope
  - The Farm Scale Evaluations (FSE) were established to determine whether genetically-modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops might significantly affect farmland wildlife through management practices.
  - Data cover four crops: Beet, Maize, Spring-sown oilseed rape, and Winter-sown oilseed rape.
  - Data are organized to support analyses across multiple ecological facets and timepoints, enabling comparisons between GMHT and conventional management.

- Datasets and data collection areas
  - Seedbank
    - Seedbank: counts of plant species germinating from a soil sample taken before planting.
    - Seedbank Follow-up 1: repeat soil sample one year after the initial seedbank sample.
    - Seedbank Follow-up 2: final soil sample taken two years after the initial sample.
  - Vegetation in the crop
    - First-seedling: first vegetation survey before herbicide application.
    - Mezzanine: Beet has an additional vegetation survey between herbicide applications on conventional vs GM sides; Winter rape has a spring pre-herbicide survey.
    - Post-herbicide: vegetation survey after herbicide application on both conventional and GM sides.
    - Final Counts: vegetation survey aligned with biomass sampling just before harvest.
    - Biomass: weed biomass sampled in the month before harvest.
    - Seed Rain: counts of seeds produced throughout the growing season.
    - Follow-up 1 and Follow-up 2: vegetation surveys conducted one year and two years after the trial crop.
  - Field edge vegetation
    - Margin Attributes: physical features around the trial field edge.
    - Edge Veg Cover: percent cover of non-crop vegetation (recorded June).
    - Edge Veg Flower: plant flowering period (April–August).
    - Edge Veg Seed: seed setting (July–August).
    - Edge Bare Ground: percent bare ground.
    - Edge Spray Damage: vegetation damage from spraying.
  - Invertebrates
    - Bee and Butterfly transects: monthly counts in crop and field margins (April–August); combined as Pollinators.
    - Crop Pests: counts of herbivores on the crop early and late in the season.
    - Gastropods: Gastropod Search (field margin) and Gastropod Trap (in crop, spring and autumn).
    - Pitfall: counts of surface-active invertebrates (early, mid, late season).
    - Vortis: counts of arthropods on plants (early and late season; in verge and crop).
  - Additional tables
    - Date drilled, Herbicides applied, Height/Cover of weeds and crop.
  - Data organization
    - Table naming convention uses abbreviated prefix, crop, sample date, and protocol (e.g., sum_b_seedrain for Beet crop seed rain; sum_b_early_pitfall for Beet crop early-season pitfalls).

- Table structure and properties
  - Generic properties
    - Each row represents half-field totals (counts, biomass, or mean percent cover) for a separate site.
    - Group totals and individual species contributions are both provided.
    - Sites are referenced within Defra government regions; South-eastern and Eastern England regions are aggregated for confidentiality.
    - Nulls indicate no verified data; some counts are decimal due to calculating over a proportion of transects.
  - Specific properties
    - All crop_pest tables use a name suffix of 'W+' or 'W-' to denote winged vs. wingless status.
  - Column headings (key examples)
    - conv_count, conv_count_FL, conv_count_GE4TL, conv_count_L4TL, conv_count_SE (conventional crop counts by category)
    - gm_count, gm_count_FL, gm_count_GE4TL, gm_count_L4TL, gm_count_SE (GMHT crop counts by category)
    - crop_cover (percent cover of crop)
    - crop_unit (C = conventional crop, GM = GM crop)
    - crop_height (crop height in cm)
    - name (species or group name)
    - site_ref (site reference number)
    - Region (Defra government region or aggregate)
    - VEG/ARTHROPOD/GASTROPOD/BB_BRC (codes for data type)
    - weed_cover_pc (percent cover of non-crop vegetation)

- How the dataset is structured for data support
  - Cross-crop and multi-timepoint coverage enables comparative analyses of GMHT versus conventional management across weed communities, invertebrates, field margins, and crop performance.
  - Rich metadata at the site, region, and protocol levels supports filtering, joining, and re-using data in dashboards, reports, or analytical products.
  - Detailed species- and group-level data alongside aggregated totals allows both high-level summaries and granular investigations.

- Relevance for data support work
  - The dataset mirrors common data support needs: clear naming conventions, well-defined data schemas, and comprehensive metadata to enable data discovery, quality assessment, and reproducible analyses.
  - Structured around half-field totals per site, it supports self-serve exploration, combining datasets (seedbank, vegetation, margins, invertebrates, and additional measures), and projecting ecological patterns across crops and years.
