# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides UK land cover information in multiple formats to suit different monitoring and policy-analysis needs.
- Available in both vector and raster formats, with detailed documentation and metadata to support proper use and integration into monitoring frameworks.

## Data formats and scales
- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata on derivation (see Dataset Documentation).
  - Minimum mappable unit: 0.5 hectares.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: United Kingdom.
- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total.
  - A 25 x 25 m raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarise the 25 x 25 m raster.
  - Detailed metadata for raster formats available in the Dataset Documentation.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
  - Supply format: GeoTiff.
  - Coverage: United Kingdom.

## Metadata and documentation
- The primary reference is the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
  - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes for LCM2007.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

## Access, coverage, and formats
- Further information and specifics are provided in the Dataset Documentation, detailing attributes, classes, and raster metadata to support appropriate use and integration into analyses.

## Relevance for monitoring framework authors
- Provides multi-resolution land cover data suitable for environmental health indicators at different scales (parcel-level in vector; broad habitat summaries in raster).
- Supports data provenance and governance through explicit metadata and class descriptions.
- Facilitates integration with other datasets by offering standardized formats (Shapefile and GeoTiff) and clearly documented attributes.
- The 0.5 ha minimum mapping unit and available 25 m and 1 km rasters offer options for balancing spatial detail with processing and reporting needs in monitoring frameworks.
