# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- Available in multiple formats to suit different user needs across the UK.
- Vector data provides the most detailed representation: each polygon corresponds to a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata about how the data were derived (see Dataset Documentation).
- Raster data offers simplified representations: a 25 x 25 m raster for the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel, plus four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters that summarize the 25 x 25 m data.
- Coverage: UK.
