# QGIS Generated Color Map Export File

## Overview
- A QGIS-generated color map export for a discrete interpolation scheme.
- Defines a legend mapping between 50 land cover classes and RGBA color values used for visualizing environmental data.

  - Continuous urban fabric
  - Discontinuous urban fabric
  - Industrial or commercial units
  - Road and rail networks and associated land
  - Port areas
  - Airports
- Transport and infrastructure
  - Road/rail networks and associated land
  - Ports and airports
- Agricultural and managed land
  - Green urban areas
  - Sport and leisure facilities
  - Non-irrigated arable land
  - Permanently irrigated land
  - Rice fields
  - Vineyards
  - Fruit trees and berry plantations
  - Olive groves
  - Pastures
  - Annual crops associated with permanent crops
  - Complex cultivation patterns
  - Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant natural vegetation
  - Agro-forestry areas
- Forests and natural vegetation
  - Broad-leaved forest
  - Coniferous forest
  - Mixed forest
  - Natural grasslands
  - Moors and heathland
  - Sclerophyllous vegetation
  - Transitional woodland-shrub
- Natural and barren landscapes
  - Beaches, dunes, sands
  - Bare rocks
  - Sparsely vegetated areas
  - Burnt areas
  - Glaciers and perpetual snow
- Wetlands and water-related
  - Inland marshes
  - Peat bogs
  - Salt marshes
  - Salines
  - Intertidal flats
  - Water courses
  - Water bodies
  - Coastal lagoons
  - Estuaries
  - Sea and ocean
- Other categories
  - NODATA
  - UNCLASSIFIED LAND SURFACE
  - UNCLASSIFIED WATER BODIES
  - UNCLASSIFIED

## How this supports monitoring frameworks
- Provides a standardized visual legend to classify and display environmental health indicators (e.g., urban growth, agricultural cover, forest extent, water extent) across datasets.
- Enables consistent reporting and dashboards by mapping policy-relevant land cover types to distinct colors.
- Facilitates communication of complex findings through clear category distinctions (e.g., urban vs. rural, natural vegetation vs. agriculture).

## Data and governance considerations for use
- The file represents a predefined color legend; ensure metadata explains the class definitions, codes, and their policy relevance.
- Align the legend with existing monitoring frameworks to avoid misinterpretation between datasets with different classifications.
- Maintain data provenance, as class definitions, color mappings, and update cadence affect comparability over time.
- Consider data access and sharing implications if the underlying datasets used to populate these classes require transparency.

## Practical notes
- The legend lists 50 classes with associated RGBA color values to be used with a discrete interpolation scheme.
- Class identifiers include a mix of urban, agricultural, forest, wetlands, water, and unclassified categories, suitable for broad environmental monitoring and reporting.
