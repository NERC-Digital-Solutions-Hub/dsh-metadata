# Technical Report Metadata for Corine Land Cover data 2018. UK.

## Overview
- Metadata for three UK CORINE datasets: CLC2018_UK.shp, CLC2012rev_UK.shp, and CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp.
- UK coverage includes Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Guernsey, Jersey, and Northern Ireland.
- Attribute tables include: CLC level 3 classification codes, area (hectares), length, area of each feature, remarks, and a unique ID.

## Datasets Covered
- Dataset 1: Corine land cover 2018 (CLC2018_UK.shp) — status map for 2018 for the UK.
- Dataset 2: Corine land cover 2012 (revised) (CLC2012rev_UK.shp) — updated 2012 map revised during 2018 change mapping.
- Dataset 3: Corine land changes (2012-2018) (CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp) — changes between 2012 and 2018 mapped directly.

## Metadata and Standards
- Metadata language: English; metadata compliant with the EEA Metadata Profile (INSPIRE-compliant with some extended elements).
- Online resource: http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/gb/eea/clc/envvlpnwa/ (WWW:LINK-1.0-http--link).
- File identifier: CLC_metadata_UK; Character set: UTF-8.
- Coverage and scope: UK component of CORINE Land Cover data; base parameters include 44 land cover classes, MMU 25 ha for status, MMU 5 ha for land cover changes.

## Methodology and Lineage
- Updated for reference year 2018; change detection for changes >5 ha.
- Data sources: Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery from 2017; supported by Google Earth imagery; EEA technical guidelines followed; InterChange tool used for mapping changes and revising the 2012 map.
- Rationale and uses: Consistent land cover information to monitor environmental change, support indicators, and EU policy reporting (e.g., biodiversity, climate impacts, agriculture, Water Framework Directive).

## Quality Assurance
- Internal quality control: All Working Units (WUs) undergo dual interpretation and review; use of InterCheck software; feedback loops to interpreters.
- External quality control: European Technical Team (CTT) conducted two remote verifications in Feb and June 2018; additional checks on six WUs; employed similar visual checks and error reporting.

## Access, Use, and Licensing
- Access restrictions: Data governed by Commission Regulation and GMES licensing; free, full, and open access with conditions.
- Obligations: Acknowledge data source, avoid implying Union endorsement, state if data are modified, and respect EU ownership of results where applicable.
