# QGIS Generated Color Map Export File

- Overview
  - A QGIS color map export using discrete interpolation that defines a color ramp for 50 land cover and land use classes.
  - Each entry maps a numeric index to a specific CORINE-style land cover category, with an associated RGBA color value for map visualization.
  - Includes categories ranging from urban fabric and infrastructure to agriculture, forests, wetlands, and water bodies, plus unclassified and nodata options.

- Data structure and format
  - Interpolation: DISCRETE, meaning each class is assigned a single, distinct color.
  - Each line contains:
    - An index (1–50)
    - RGBA color values (R, G, B, A)
    - The class code (e.g., 111, 112, 121, …)
    - The descriptive label for the class
  - End-of-list categories include UNCLASSIFIED LAND SURFACE (990) and UNCLASSIFIED WATER BODIES (995/990 variants), plus NODATA (999).

- Practical use for environmental monitoring
  - Provides a standardized visual language to compare land cover changes over time across datasets and reports.
  - Facilitates consistent map outputs for policy performance dashboards and monitoring reports.
  - Supports data quality workflows by clearly defining the exact color for each class, aiding in cross-agency data sharing and portal uploads.

- Considerations for analysts
  - Ensure class mappings align with internal classifications and any updates to the classification schema (e.g., CORINE-like codes).
  - Maintain the color ramp consistently across projects and time periods to preserve comparability.
  - Verify that UNCLASSIFIED and NODATA codes are correctly interpreted during analysis and visualization.
