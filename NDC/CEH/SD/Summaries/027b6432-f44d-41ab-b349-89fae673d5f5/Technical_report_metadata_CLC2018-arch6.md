# Centre for Landscape and Climate Research School Geography, Geology and Environment Technical Report Metadata for Corine Land Cover data 2018. UK.

## Overview
- Metadata for three UK Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets: CLC2018_UK.shp, CLC2012rev_UK.shp, and CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp.
- UK coverage includes Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Guernsey, Jersey, and Northern Ireland.
- Attribute tables include CLC level-3 classification codes, area (hectares), length, area of features, and remarks/unique ID.

## Datasets included
- Dataset 1: Corine land cover 2018 (CLC2018_UK.shp)
  - Final UK status map for 2018.
  - Projection: British National Grid; Transverse Mercator; GCS_OSGB_1936; Datum D_OSGB_1936.
- Dataset 2: Corine land cover 2012 (revised) for the UK (CLC2012rev_UK.shp)
  - Updated 2012 map produced during 2018 change mapping.
  - Same projection details as above.
- Dataset 3: Corine land changes (2012-2018) for the UK (CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp)
  - Changes between 2012 and 2018, mapped directly.
  - Same projection details as above.

## Technical metadata and metadata framework
- Copernicus CORINE metadata 2018 context:
  - Includes CLC 2018, 2012 revised, and 2012-2018 change layers as part of European land monitoring.
  - 44-class Corine nomenclature; MMU: 25 ha for status, 5 ha for changes.
  - Contributes to environmental monitoring, policy support, and EU directives (e.g., biodiversity, climate change, agriculture, Water Framework Directive).
- Metadata language: English; metadata hierarchy level: Dataset.
- Online resource link and formal metadata support (INSPIRE-compliant with extended elements).

## Data content and format notes
- Spatial format: Shapefiles (three datasets above) with consistent schema.
- Extent: West -8.62, East 1.76, South 49.88, North 60.84 (geographic bounding box for UK + territories).
- Spatial resolution indicator: Denominator 100000 (1:100,000 scale context).
- Keywords: Land cover, Land use, UK.

## Lineage and methodology
- Objective: Update UK CLC for 2018; detect/mapping land cover changes >5 ha.
- Basis: Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery from 2017; supplemented by Google Earth aerial imagery.
- Methodology: Follow EEA technical guidelines; mapping done with InterChange support package; revision of 2012 map.
- Output integrated into seamless Europe-wide CLC products.

## Access, licensing, and constraints
- Use limitation: Access governed by EU Regulation 1159/13 (Copernicus data licensing); conditions for free, full, open access.
  - Must attribute source and avoid implying EU endorsement; clearly indicate if data were modified.
  - EU ownership applies to data/products produced under Copernicus funding.
- Data identifier: CLC_metadata_UK; Metadata language: English; Character set: UTF-8.
- Point of contact and stewardship: Originator (University of Leicester), Custodian (Defra), Owner (European Environment Agency and European Commission DG ENTR).

## Quality assurance
- Internal quality control by University of Leicester:
  - Each Working Unit (WU) independently reviewed by two interpreters; cross-checked with InterCheck software; feedback loops to editors.
- External quality control by European Technical Team (CTT) in Feb 2018 and Jun 2018:
  - Remote verifications across selected WUs and areas; errors documented in shapefiles and verification reports; outcomes fed back to interpretation team.
- Overall aim: Ensure harmonised European CLC2018 outputs.

## Usage notes and potential applications
- Suitable for analyzing land cover and land cover changes in the UK at 2018 and for 2012-2018 change detection.
- Useful for environmental indicators, policy assessment, land-use planning, and reporting under EU/UK environmental frameworks.
- Outputs can support dashboards, maps, and self-serve analyses of UK land cover dynamics (with appropriate licensing).
