# Authors of Monitoring Frameworks

## Aim
- Identify environmental health measures for scrutinising and evaluating policy, and informing future decisions.

## Who they are
- They work in managerial roles within government departments or environmental quangos, responsible for deciding on and implementing monitoring approaches.

## How they meet their aims
- Understand which measures provide useful insight by engaging with stakeholders and experts; learn from others to avoid duplication.
- Find and verify available data, often overcoming metadata shortcomings by contacting dataset originators.
- May need to add metadata to datasets; often must publicly share the data used, which can be a barrier.
- Commission new data to fill gaps; ensure quality, openness, and data management standards are set at the source.
- Ensure data is quality assured, cleaned, transformed, analysed, and findings presented clearly (reports, charts, dashboards).
- Disseminate outputs, consult stakeholders, ensure underlying data is shared appropriately, and implement data governance processes.

## Particular Challenges
- Lack of data, including data at a good enough standard.
- Lack of access to data, including timely access.
- Silos within and between organisations acting as barriers.
- Requirement to publicly share datasets used can be a barrier to using some data.
- Concerns about keeping data up to date hindering data sharing.
- Inadequate metadata hindering verification of data suitability.
- Data formats requiring effortful transformation to be usable.
- Difficulty communicating complex findings clearly.
- Putting data governance processes in place to ensure datasets meet standards, are stored, shared, and kept up to date.
