# Data Stewards

## Aim
- Ensure datasets they are responsible for meet appropriate standards and are stored, shared, and kept up to date so they can be readily discovered and used by others.
- Work for organisations or networks with large numbers of datasets and ensure appropriate data governance is in place.

## Who they are
- Work for organisations or networks with large datasets, ensuring appropriate data governance is in place.
- Understand good data management practice and work with data creators/sharers, informed by understanding data user needs.

## How they meet their aims
- Understand user needs to ensure shared datasets meet those needs; may adopt a publishing mindset to create usable datasets.
- Work with data creators to ensure standards are met (accuracy, consistency, metadata, format), providing guidance and tools.
- Identify data availability and limitations (disclosure risks, proprietary issues, embargoes).
- Receive data (sometimes requiring 'chasing up').
- Quality assure, clean, and transform datasets before sharing.
- Ensure that sharing limitations are respected and systems are in place for updates.
- Upload datasets to relevant portals and catalogue data holdings.
- May document work done on datasets.

## Particular Challenges
- An 'incomplete picture' of user needs and priorities.
- Getting data in a timely manner.
- Getting data creators to meet standards, including metadata.
- Working with many different systems and formats, including difficult ones.
- Working with large datasets that are hard to transfer.
- Working with outdated databases that necessitate bespoke, non-interoperable solutions.
