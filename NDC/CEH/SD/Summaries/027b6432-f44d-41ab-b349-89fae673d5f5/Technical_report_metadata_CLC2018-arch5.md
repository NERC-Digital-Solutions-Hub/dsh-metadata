Centre for Landscape and Climate Research School Geography, Geology and Environment Technical Report Metadata for Corine Land Cover data 2018. UK.

## Overview
- Metadata report for three UK Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets: CLC2018_UK.shp, CLC2012rev_UK.shp, and CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp.
- Coverage includes the UK and crown dependencies: Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Guernsey, Jersey, Northern Ireland.
- Datasets contain CLC level-3 codes, area, length, and feature remarks with unique IDs; intended as a status and change map series for 2018 and prior revisions.

## Datasets and Descriptions
- Dataset 1: Corine land cover 2018
  - Filename: CLC2018_UK.shp
  - Description: Final UK 2018 CLC status map.
  - Projection: British National Grid; Transverse Mercator; GCS_OSGB_1936; Datum D_OSGB_1936.
- Dataset 2: Corine land cover 2012 (revised)
  - Filename: CLC2012rev_UK.shp
  - Description: Updated CLC2012 map for the UK, revised during 2018 change mapping.
  - Projection: British National Grid; Transverse Mercator; GCS_OSGB_1936; Datum D_OSGB_1936.
- Dataset 3: Corine land changes (2012-2018) for the UK
  - Filename: CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp
  - Description: Changes between 2012 and 2018 mapped directly.
  - Projection: British National Grid; Transverse Mercator; GCS_OSGB_1936; Datum D_OSGB_1936.

## Metadata, Standards, and Access
- Metadata language: English; metadata aligned with the EEA Metadata Profile and INSPIRE-compliant guidelines, with some extended elements.
- Online resource and linkage: project metadata accessible through specified Copernicus/EEA portals.
- Key governance and contact points:
  - Originator: University of Leicester
  - Custodian: Defra
  - Owner: European Environment Agency (with involvement from European Commission DG-ENTR)
  - Point of contact: multi-organisational (University of Leicester, Defra, EEA)
- Scope and keywords: Land cover, land use, UK, imagery base maps/earth cover.

## Lineage and Technical Basis
- Lineage: UK CLC2018 updated from 2012 map; changes mapped for 2012-2018 using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery from 2017; supported by Google Earth imagery; adherence to EEA technical guidelines; InterChange mapping package used for CLC production and 2012 revision.
- Purpose: provide consistent, Europe-wide land cover inventories with time series suitable for environmental monitoring, policy support, and indicators.
- MMU and classification: standard Corine parameters (e.g., 44 classes; MMU for status layers 25 ha; LCC changes MMU 5 ha).

## Quality Control and Verification
- Internal QC: University of Leicester conducted independent checks; double-interpretation per Working Unit (WU) using InterCheck software; feedback loops prior to finalisation.
- External QC: European Technical Team (CTT) conducted remote verifications in Feb and Jun 2018 across several WUs to ensure harmonised European CLC2018 output.
- Documentation of errors and corrections fed back to interpreters; results reprocessed to ensure consistency.

## Data Access, Use and Licensing
- Use limitations: Access governed by EU regulations (GMES/Copernicus framework); free, full, open access with conditions:
  - Acknowledge data source to the public.
  - Do not imply EU endorsement of user activities.
  - Clearly state if data or results have been adapted or modified.
- Ownership and rights: EU responsibility for data produced under Copernicus; attribution to funding and originators as specified.
- Data dissemination: Datasets intended for upload to relevant portals and catalogues; ongoing availability subject to governance and licensing conditions.

## Geographic and Temporal Scope
- Extent: UK and associated territories; geographic bounding box approx. West -8.62 to East 1.76; South 49.88 to North 60.84.
- Temporal coverage: Status maps for 2018 and revised 2012 map; change layer covering 2012–2018.

## Governance, Documentation, and Acknowledgments
- Documentation: Metadata language, lineage, and quality control documented in detail; project notes include interpretation processes and the use of InterCheck.
- Acknowledgments: Project conducted by University of Leicester and Specto Natura; supported by the European Environment Agency under Copernicus Programme funding.
- File and metadata stewardship: Data custodianship and metadata upkeep aligned with INSPIRE/EEA guidelines; metadata and datasets identified with file identifiers (e.g., CLC_metadata_UK) and UTF-8 encoding.

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- Ensure ongoing governance by maintaining INSPIRE-aligned metadata, including lineage, access conditions, and QA procedures.
- Facilitate discoverability through portal uploads and catalogue indexing; clearly document update cycles and provenance.
- Maintain clear ownership and contact points; monitor licensing terms and attribution requirements for end users.
- Preserve interoperability across datasets by adhering to standard coordinate systems, MMU rules, and classification schemes.
