# Centre for Landscape and Climate Research School Geography, Geology and Environment Technical Report Metadata for Corine Land Cover data 2018. UK.

## Executive scope
- Metadata report for three UK CORINE datasets: CLC2018_UK.shp, CLC2012rev_UK.shp, and CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp.
- Coverage: United Kingdom including Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Guernsey, Jersey, and Northern Ireland.
- Attribute tables include: CORINE classification codes at level 3, area (hectares), length, area of features, remarks, and a unique ID.

## Datasets and descriptions
- Dataset 1: Corine land cover 2018 (CLC2018_UK.shp)
  - Status map for UK, 2018.
  - Projection: British National Grid; Projection: Transverse Mercator; Geographic CS: GCS_OSGB_1936; Datum: D_OSGB_1936.
- Dataset 2: Corine land cover 2012 (revised) for the UK (CLC2012rev_UK.shp)
  - Updated 2012 map revised in 2018 process; same CRS as Dataset 1.
- Dataset 3: Corine land changes (2012-2018) for the UK (CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp)
  - Changes mapped directly between 2012 and 2018; same CRS as above.

## Metadata and standards
- Metadata language: English; hierarchical level: Dataset.
- Compliance: Metadata compliant with the EEA Metadata Profile (INSPIRE compliant with some extensions).
- Online resource: Linked metadata page and data access portal.
- Languages and character set: English; UTF-8.
- Key identifiers: File identifier CLC_metadata_UK.

## Geographic and data characteristics
- Geographic extent: West -8.62; East 1.76; South 49.88; North 60.84.
- Spatial resolution: Denominator 100000 (approximately 1:100,000 scale).
- MMU parameters and class details:
  - Status layers MMU: 25 hectares.
  - Land Cover Change (LCC) MMU: 5 hectares.
- Keywords: Land cover, land use, UK.

## Lineage and methodology
- CORINE/Copernicus framework: part of Copernicus Land Monitoring; 44-class Corine nomenclature; historical series with key years (1990 onwards) and updates in 2000, 2006, 2012.
- Data sources and interpretation:
  - Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery (2017) for 2018 mapping.
  - Aerial imagery from Google Earth to support interpretation.
  - InterChange mapping package used; EEA technical guidelines followed.
- Objective: detect and map land cover and changes above 5 hectares; integrate national data into a seamless European map.

## Data quality and verification
- Internal quality control (IQC): All Work Units (WUs) independently checked by two interpreters; two-person review; InterCheck software used; feedback incorporated before completion.
- External quality control (EQC): European Technical Team (CTT) conducted two remote verifications (Feb and Jun 2018) across multiple WUs to ensure harmonised European CLC2018 standards.
- Verification outputs: error points with descriptive attributes and verification reports provided to interpreters.

## Access, licensing, and use conditions
- Data access governed by Commission delegated regulation (EU) No 1159/13; free, full, and open access with conditions:
  - Users must acknowledge the source of the data.
  - Users should not imply Union endorsement of their activities.
  - Any adaptations or modifications must be clearly stated.
- Data identifiers and licensing context reflect Copernicus program rules; data ownership and distribution terms involve EU bodies (EEA, DG ENTR) and national custodian (Defra).

## Stakeholders and contacts
- Originator: University of Leicester (Centre for Landscape and Climate Research).
- Custodian: Defra.
- Owner/Point of contact: European Environment Agency; European Commission - DG Enterprise and Industry.
- Acknowledgments include University of Leicester, Specto Natura, and EU Copernicus program funding (Grant EEA/IDM/R0/16/009/UK).

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Governance and interoperability: The metadata aligns with INSPIRE/EEA standards, supporting cross-border data sharing and harmonisation within the Copernicus framework.
- Data strategy considerations: Ensures discoverability and consistent quality controls (internal and external) across UK CORINE datasets; clear lineage supports auditability and future re-mapping efforts.
- Data products and usage: MMU and scale guidance (1:100,000) informs when the data is suitable for analyses requiring stable aggregation at regional scales; awareness of change detection intervals (2012-2018) aids trend analysis.
- Access and licensing: Compliance with EU delegated regulation and attribution requirements is essential for public-sector and partner use; maintain proper licensing notices when distributing data.
- Collaboration and continuity: Documented roles (Originator, Custodian, Owner) and external verification processes underscore the importance of coordinated data stewardship across national and European bodies.
