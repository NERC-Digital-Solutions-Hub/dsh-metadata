# Environmental Monitoring Data Summary

- Purpose: Demonstrate environmental condition over time using data in a consistent format to enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance.
- Organisational context: Prepared by entities with defined environmental monitoring responsibilities, leveraging topic expertise and standardised analytical approaches.

## Data handling and quality assurance

- Source data: Gathered from established, recognized data sources.
- Quality processes: Verify accuracy, quality assure, clean, and transform data to ready it for analysis.
- Data stewardship: Create datasets and ensure they are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Analysis and outputs

- Methods: Apply standardised analytical approaches to interpret data.
- Outputs: Produce clear representations such as reports, maps, and charts that categorise environmental health against relevant standards or benchmarks.

## Data accessibility and interoperability

- Accessibility: Ensure underlying data used for outputs is accessible to others to promote transparency and reuse.
- Interoperability: Maintain data in standardized formats to facilitate integration with other datasets and systems.

## Challenges and opportunities

- Value enhancement: Increase the utility of monitoring datasets by integrating them with other relevant data rather than keeping them as single-use outputs.
- Data sharing: Improve access to underlying data to support broader analysis, decision-making, and accountability.

## Relevance to monitoring and policy

- Consistency and comparability: Standardised methods enable consistent tracking of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Accountability: Clear reporting formats and data portal uploads support scrutiny by stakeholders and enable ongoing policy assessment.
