# Interview guideline

- Objective: Use a structured, bilingual interview approach (Portuguese and Elomwe) to gather information from various actor groups.
- Training and roles: Lead researcher + assistant/translator; pre-interview objective and question delivery trained; assistant conducts some exercises independently later.
- Triangulation and focus: Repeated discussions across groups and topics to validate information; use contextual cues from interviews, conversations, and focus groups to refine interview focus.
- Group composition: Village leader assembles participant groups per request; focus groups include men and women with inclusive invitation to contribute.
- Translation: Native-speaking translator/assistant present; questions translated as needed between Portuguese and Elomwe.
- Note taking: Both the lead researcher and assistant take notes during interviews.
- Post-interview discussion: Information discussed with assistants/colleagues to improve understanding; seek clarification from locals when needed.
- Transcript handling: After fieldwork, notes written in English (assistant notes in Portuguese translated to English); ensures consistent documentation for analysis.
- Data backup: Multiple backups created for all documents to safeguard information.
