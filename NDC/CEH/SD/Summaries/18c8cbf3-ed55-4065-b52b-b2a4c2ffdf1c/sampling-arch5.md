# Sampling Design

- Timeframe and setting
  - Period of sampling: July 2015 to December 2015
  - Study site: Gurue district, Zambezia province
  - Village selection: ten villages chosen along a land scarcity gradient, with similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation

- Value chain actors and sampling approach
  - Actors identified via snowball sampling: village small-scale soya producers, emergent soya farmers, managers of commercial soya operations, district officer, NGO technicians, formal and informal traders
  - Sampling strategy by actor type
    - Small-scale soya producers: focus group discussions (FGDs) with groups of 5–7 producers in each village
    - Emergent farmers: identified by snowball sampling; one farmer convenes a group for FGD
    - Informal traders: randomly interviewed at roadside buying points
    - All other actors of interest: contacted and interviewed

- Data collection methodologies
  - Semi-structured interviews
    - Conducted in action sites (village center, along roads, plantation offices) as appropriate
  - Focus group discussions
    - Led by a village leader; 1–2 hours
  - Informal communication
    - Ongoing daytime interactions; field notes recorded; translator (Portuguese to Elomwe) present
    - Electronic transcripts prepared back in the office
  - Triangulation
    - Information cross-validated by discussing topics with different groups and individuals
  - Interview guidelines
    - Covered categories: soya production, soya marketing, land availability and distribution, agricultural support and inputs, constraints and challenges
    - Portuguese guidelines provided with detailed questions across multiple topics (production, marketing, contracts, land, inputs, market, and support)

- Data content and structure
  - Data collection fields and topics (examples)
    - Village name, participant names
    - Production history: start year, drivers, associations, ongoing projects, support received
    - Farm size and land ownership (DUAT), land allocation, land use before soya, expansion plans
    - Production practices, inputs, sourcing, seed/inoculants, input quality and reliability
    - Yields, costs, soil quality changes, crop rotation and intercropping
    - Marketing and sales: storage/processing options, buyers, volumes, prices, negotiation ability, distance, transport
    - Contracts and employment: contracted farmers, contract conditions, labor force
    - Socio-economic aspects: community benefits, social responsibility, impacts on subsistence farming and deforestation
    - Market dynamics: warehouses, processing facilities, prices by market, price sensitivity, risk mechanisms, buyers and supplier relations, credit use
  - Structure of data capture
    - Categories and prompts mirror the extensive Portuguese guideline sections, ensuring comprehensive coverage of production, marketing, land, inputs, contracts, and market dynamics

- Data management and governance considerations for Data Stewards
  - Provenance and traceability
    - Clear documentation of sampling period, locations, and the actor groups engaged
  - Data quality and consistency
    - Use of standardized semi-structured guides and FGDs to enable comparability across villages and actor types
  - Language and translation
    - Fieldwork conducted with a translator; transcripts created in English after fieldwork
  - Metadata and documentation
    - Data fields include village, participants, date, and interview context; core topics listed to facilitate metadata creation
  - Ethics and privacy (not explicitly specified in document)
    - Implementation notes indicate potential need for consent, confidentiality, and handling of sensitive information (not detailed in text)
  - Data interopability and reuse
    - Rich qualitative and structured data; potential for sharing with clear metadata and documented methodology, though data format and access terms are not defined in the document

- Potential limitations and considerations
  - Sampling bias
    - Snowball sampling may influence representativeness; reliance on village leaders and networks for FGDs
  - Translation and transcription
    - Possible interpretation differences between local language and English; reliance on translator
  - Depth versus breadth
    - Extensive guidelines cover many topics; practical constraints may affect depth per topic per respondent

- End note
  - The document presents the methodology and data collection framework without reporting results; it lays a comprehensive foundation for data capture on soya production, marketing, land use, and market dynamics in the selected districts.
