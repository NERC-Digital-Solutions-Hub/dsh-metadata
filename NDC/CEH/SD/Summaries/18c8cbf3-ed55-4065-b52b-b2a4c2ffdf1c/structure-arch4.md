# Details of data structure

## Overview
- A dataset comprising 19 RTf documents containing interview transcripts from multiple villages.
- All interviewee names are anonymized.
- Documents include focus group discussions (FGDs) with small-scale soya producers and various interviews (technicians, traders, company managers, SDAE).

## Contents and structure
- 11 FGDs (FGD_Mahara, FGD_Mcunua, FGD_Natxoa, FGD_Nuisse, FGD_Moquito, FGD_Serra, FGD_Muhelo, FGD_Nakuphi, FGD_Namiepe, FGD_Palacue, FGD_emergent farmer) with 4–8 participants each.
- 8 interviews (Interview_TechnoServe, Interviews_trader1, Interviews_trader2, Interview_trader.large, Interview_company1, Interview_company2, Interview_company3, Interview_SDAE).
- Each document includes participant composition (gender and roles where stated), approximate duration (about 1 hour for FGDs; 1–1.5 hours for interviews), and data collection dates.
- Transcripts are available in English; many original notes were in Elomwe or Portuguese and later translated.

## Data collection details
- FGDs conducted with groups of small-scale soya producers; some groups include women and men, others are all men, plus roles like school coordinator or secretario.
- Interviews cover traders, private soya producing companies, TechnoServe technicians, and district economic activities staff (SDAE).
- Some sessions used a question catalogue with 33 questions; others used semi-structured guidelines.
- Data collection occurred across several dates in 2015 (July–December), with multiple sites.

## Language and transcription
- Primary languages encountered: Portuguese and Elomwe (with translation to Portuguese and English).
- All transcripts referenced as English translations; original notes sometimes retained in non-English languages.

## Metadata and anonymization
- Interviewee identities are anonymized; some participant roles are specified (e.g., trader, school coordinator, gerente/manager).
- Metadata includes participant counts, gender distribution, session type (FGD vs. interview), and data collection dates.

## Data formats and accessibility
- The dataset comprises 19 RTf documents, all in RTf format.
- Transcripts are available in English; some materials include Portuguese originals or Elomwe notes.
- Structured by session type and village/setting, enabling cross-site analysis.

## Quality, standards, and governance considerations
- Multilingual data with translation steps; potential for translation variance and interpretation differences.
- Varied formats (FGD vs. interview; 33-question guide vs. semi-structured) may affect comparability.
- Anonymization is maintained, but metadata such as exact village names is not provided here, which may impact contextual analysis.

## Implications for data strategy (for Data Leaders)
- Demonstrates the value of aggregating heterogeneous qualitative data from multiple sources into a unified asset.
- Highlights the importance of consistent metadata (participants, language, date, session type) to improve discoverability and reuse.
- Illustrates challenges in multilingual data collection and the need for clear translation pipelines and documentation of original languages.
- Suggests potential for cross-site analysis of value-chain actors (producers, traders, company managers) to inform policy and program design.
- Underlines importance of anonymization and role-based metadata to support ethical data sharing while preserving analytical utility.
