# Sampling Design

## Overview and aims
- Describes a field study conducted from July 2015 to December 2015 in Gurue district, Zambezia province, focusing on the soya supply chain.
- Objective aligned with monitoring framework authors: identify environmental health and policy-relevant measures across production, markets, land tenure, and governance to inform decisions and potential interventions.

## Study site and village selection
- Selection based on a land scarcity gradient: from villages with abundant land to those with high land constraints due to expanding agriculture and population density.
- Ten villages chosen to represent various stages of the gradient while sharing similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation.

## Identification of value chain actors
- Used snowball sampling to identify key actors in the soya supply chain.
- Actors include: village small-scale soya producers, emergent (middle-tier) farmers, managers of commercial soy operations, district officers, NGO technicians, and formal/informal traders.

## Sampling strategy and participant categories
- Small-scale soya producers: focus group discussions with groups of 5–7 producers.
- Emergent farmers: identified via snowball sampling; one farmer with groups of colleagues.
- Informal traders: randomly interviewed at buying points along roads.
- Other actors: interviewed or meetings arranged as relevant.

## Data collection methodologies
- Semi-structured interviews conducted in situ (village centers, roads, plantation offices) with translations from Portuguese to local language Elomwe.
- Focus group discussions: led by village leaders; sessions last 1–2 hours.
- Informal communications: ongoing day-to-day interactions documented by researchers; transcripts created later.
- Triangulation: information cross-validated by repeatedly discussing topics with different groups and individuals.

## Interview and data collection guidelines
- Guidelines cover categories such as soya production, marketing, land availability and distribution, agricultural inputs and support, and constraints.
- A comprehensive Portuguese-language questionnaire structure guided the data collection, including sections on:
  - Production practices, yields, inputs, inputs sourcing, quality, and reliability of supply.
  - Marketing, storage/processing, buyers, volumes, pricing, margins, contract terms, and sales strategies.
  - Contracts with smallholders, implementation issues, and supplier relationships.
  - Land and tenure: allocation, prior land use, expansion plans, social responsibility, and potential conflicts.
  - Production support: extension services, training, DUAT status, cooperative affiliations, and benefits or disadvantages from larger producers.
  - Land allocation and land-use decisions: land access, vegetation, open machambas, and deforestation implications.
  - Inputs and supply chain: input suppliers, costs, credit access, and whether inputs are used for other crops.
  - Market and commerce: processing facilities, warehouses, storage, transport, transportation costs, market information, price signaling, and buyers’ requirements.
  - Business attributes: store locations, origins, product ranges, pricing decisions, storage capacity, transport, credit usage, and profitability.
  - Deforestation and environmental effects: whether soy cultivation contributes to forest clearance and soil health changes.

## Data management and governance considerations
- Emphasizes data quality, metadata, and openness, mirroring monitoring-framework concerns:
  - Verification and documentation of data provenance (originators of datasets).
  - Public sharing of underlying data where appropriate, noting potential barriers.
  - Clear data governance and storage practices to maintain up-to-date datasets.
- Field translation and documentation processes designed to ensure data integrity and comparability across actors and sites.

## Relevance for monitoring and policy
- Provides rich, multi-actor data across production, markets, and land-use dynamics that are critical for:
  - Tracking environmental health indicators linked to agricultural expansion and land tenure (e.g., deforestation risk, soil health, land-use changes).
  - Understanding data gaps, silos, and governance barriers that impede timely data sharing and use in policy.
  - Informing the design of monitoring frameworks with measurable variables: yields, land area under soy, input use and costs, market channels, price signals, contract prevalence, credit access, and social/environmental impacts.
- The methodology supports ongoing monitoring by enabling triangulated, stakeholder-informed insights that can guide regulatory compliance, transparency, and data-driven decision-making in the soy value chain.
