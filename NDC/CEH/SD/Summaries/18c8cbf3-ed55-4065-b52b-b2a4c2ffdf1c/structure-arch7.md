## Language, translation, and anonymization
- Transcripts primarily in English; some original notes in Elomwe; translations to Portuguese and English.
- Interviewees anonymized; no personally identifying details.

## Data structure and formats
- 19 separate rtf documents; each corresponds to a single interview or focus group.

## Dates and provenance
- Data collection dates span July 2015 to December 2015.
- Collected by researchers with translators/assistants; includes translation support.

## GIS-relevant considerations
- Current data are non-spatial transcripts; can be linked to spatial units (villages) for geospatial analysis.
- To use in GIS, geocode villages, then analyze themes by group type (FGD vs. interviews), participant gender composition, or stakeholder category (traders, tech/service providers, company management, SDAE).
- Maintain anonymized IDs and multilingual metadata; preserve original language notes where applicable.

## Quality and limitations
- Variable data richness (session length, depth, and translation quality).
- Requires standardization for integration into a GIS-enabled data product.
