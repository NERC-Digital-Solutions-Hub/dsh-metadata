# Sampling Design

- Period and setting: July 2015 to December 2015; Gurue district, Zambezia province.
- Study objective: investigate the soya value chain to identify actors, production practices, marketing dynamics, land access, inputs, contracts, and constraints; data to support analysis of correlations and potential impacts.
  
## Village selection and landscape context

- Land scarcity gradient used to select 10 villages, ranging from abundant land to high land constraints due to expanding agriculture and population growth.
- Villages chosen to have similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation types to enable comparable analysis.

## Identification of value chain actors

- Actor identification via snowball sampling.
- Target actors: village-level soya producers (small-scale and emergent), managers of commercial soy-producing operations, district officers, NGO technicians, and formal/informal traders.

## Sampling strategy by actor group

- Small-scale soya producers: focus group discussions in each village; leaders mobilize 5–7 producers per group.
- Emergent farmers: identified through snowball sampling; one farmer convenes a group of colleagues for a focus group.
- Informal traders: random interviews at street buying points.
- Other actors: interviews arranged as they are identified.

## Data collection methodologies

- Semi-structured interviews:
  - Conducted at action sites (village center, along roads with mobile traders, plantation offices).
- Focus group discussions:
  - Led by village leaders; sessions last 1–2 hours.
- Informal communication:
  - Ongoing interactions recorded by researchers; translator (Portuguese to Elomwe) accompanies all activities.
- Documentation:
  - Field notes and notebook entries; electronic transcripts prepared back at the office.
- Triangulation:
  - Repeated discussions across different groups and individuals to validate information.

## Interview guidelines and topics (Portuguese guidance)

- Primary categories covered in interviews and discussions:
  - Soya production
  - Soya marketing
  - Land availability and distribution
  - Agricultural inputs and support
  - Constraints and challenges
- Structure includes targeted questions for large-scale private companies and village-level actors on:
  - Production details (crops, hectares, yields, inputs, suppliers, seed sources, soil improvement)
  - Marketing (storage/processing, selling locations, volumes, buyers, prices, margins, contract terms)
  - Contracts (smallholder engagement, conditions, implementation challenges, pricing)
  - Land (allocation, prior use, expansion plans, social responsibility)
  - Support and development (extension services, training, inputs access, DUAT status, cooperative/association involvement)
  - Production constraints (land access, water, forest pressures, regulatory barriers)
  - Future plans and perceptions of development impacts
- Additional sections capture:
  - Village-level data (names, participant details, farming history, project involvement, NGO support)
  - Land allocation specifics (crop mix, land acquisition, conflicts, rotation, expansion feasibility)
  - Inputs and supply chain (costs, suppliers, access to credits, quality and reliability of inputs, equipment use)
  - Market dynamics (processing facilities, storage, seasonal selling patterns, price fluctuation awareness, buyer relationships, risk mechanisms)
  - Business actors (store locations, growth, sourcing, pricing decisions, margins, credit use, transport, storage capacity)
  - Seasonal and price-driven production decisions

## Data collection logistics and quality considerations

- Language and translation:
  - Fieldwork conducted with a Portuguese–Elomwe translation support; notes and transcripts prepared in the office.
- Documentation and traceability:
  - Field data associated with village name and participant identifiers; detailed recording of responses and context.
- Data scope:
  - Focus on both production-side and market-side dynamics to enable integrated analysis of correlations and potential policy or program impacts.

## End notes

- The design emphasizes capturing a comprehensive, multi-actor picture of the soya value chain across a land-gradient landscape, using mixed methods (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and informal exchanges) to ensure triangulated, context-rich data suitable for analysis and modeling.
