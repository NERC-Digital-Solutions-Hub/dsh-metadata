# Details of data structure

- Dataset scope
  - 19 RTF documents containing transcripts of interviews and focus group discussions conducted in multiple villages.
  - Interview participants are anonymized; only roles and participant counts are recorded.

- Content overview
  - Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)
    - FGD_Mahara, FGD_Mcunua, FGD_Natxoa, FGD_Nuisse, FGD_Moquito, FGD_Serra, FGD_Muhelo, FGD_Nakuphi, FGD_Namiepe, FGD_Palacue, FGD_emergent farmer.
    - Each FGD includes the number of producers, gender breakdown, approximate duration (~1 hour, some up to 1.5 hours), translator/assistant presence (Portuguese-Elomwe), and data date.
    - Some FGDs use a question catalogue with 33 questions.
  - Individual interviews
    - Interviews with TechnoServe technician (Interview_TechnoServe), traders (Interviews_trader1, Interviews_trader2, Interview_trader.large), private soy-producing company managers (Interview_company1, Interview_company2, Interview_company3), and SDAE technician (Interview_SDAE), plus an informal communication entry.
    - Interview languages vary (Portuguese, English); transcripts are in English or translated into English.
    - Dates range from July to December 2015; durations range from ~10 minutes to ~1.5 hours.

- Language and translation
  - Original notes in Elomwe and Portuguese; translations to English provided for transcripts.
  - Some entries include both the original language and translated English versions.

- Data structure and file naming
  - Files are named to reflect content type and location (e.g., FGD_<location>, Interview_<type>), with consistent documentation of the interview context.
  - 19 transcripts in total, all stored as RTf documents.

- Metadata and provenance
  - For each entry: location, participant counts, gender breakdown, roles (producer, trader, technician, manager, etc.), data date, language, translator/assistant presence, and transcript language.
  - Anonymization of interviewee names is maintained.
  - Some FGDs document the use of a 33-question catalog and note the data collection method (e.g., question catalogue or open/semistructured interview).

- Data quality and processing
  - Transcripts indicate the presence of translators and note translation workflow (Elomwe → Portuguese → English; some data originally in Portuguese).
  - Variation in data collection methods across entries ( FGDs with 33-question catalog vs. open interviews; some with semi-structured guidelines).
  - Duration and language details provided to support comprehension and analysis.

- Governance, access, and reuse considerations
  - Anonymization is in place; however, translations introduce potential fidelity considerations that may require provenance notes and translation metadata.
  - Data appears suitable for qualitative analysis of stakeholder perspectives on soya production networks, supply chains, and associated practices.
  - For sharing and reuse, maintain a data dictionary and provenance trail, preserve original language files alongside English translations, and document any embargoes or access restrictions if they exist.

- Practical notes for data stewardship
  - Ensure consistent metadata schema across all entries (content type, location, participant counts, gender, roles, dates, languages, translation notes).
  - Preserve both original language transcripts and English translations; track translation quality and translators.
  - Provide clear discovery terms (e.g., soya producers, traders, TechnoServe, SDAE, Gurue, 2015) to facilitate dataset discovery and cross-referencing.
  - Plan for versioning and updates if additional transcripts are added or translations are revised.
