# Interview guideline

- Guidelines with questions in Portuguese prepared for interviews with different actor groups to ensure appropriate language and framing.
- Training of assistant/translator: The lead researcher and an assistant/translator conducted most exercises; prior to each session, the assistant was trained on interview objectives and question delivery, with the assistant later conducting some exercises independently.
- Triangulation and focusing: Topics were discussed across multiple groups to validate information and capture multiple perspectives; contextual information from interviews, conversations, and focus groups helped progressively sharpen interview focus.
- Composition of group: Village leaders typically assembled groups as requested; focus groups included men and women with inclusive participation encouraged.
- Translation: A translator fluent in the local language accompanied the researcher; questions were translated between Portuguese and Elomwe as needed.
- Note taking: Both the lead researcher and the assistant took notes.
- Discussion: After each interview, findings were reviewed with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding; clarification was sought from locals when needed.
- Transcript in English: In the office, notes were transcribed into English; assistant notes recorded in Portuguese were translated to English.
- Back-up: Multiple backups of all documents were prepared to safeguard data.
