# Interview guideline

- Overview: Documents guidelines for conducting interviews with different actor groups, with interview questions prepared in Portuguese.

- Training of assistant/translator: Lead researcher works with an assistant/translator; pre-interview training on objectives and question delivery; later stages may have the assistant conduct exercises independently.

- Triangulation and focusing: Repeated discussions across diverse groups to validate information; context from interviews, conversations, and focus groups helps refine interview focus.

- Composition of group: Village leader typically gathers participants; focus groups include men and women; all invited to contribute.

- Translation: Researcher accompanied by a native-language translator/assistant; questions translated between Portuguese and Elomwe as needed.

- Note taking: Both the lead researcher and the assistant take notes.

- Discussion: Post-interview discussions with the assistant or colleagues to improve understanding; clarifications sought from locals when needed.

- Transcript in English: Field notes translated back to English for recordkeeping; assistant notes in Portuguese are translated to English.

- Back-up: Multiple backups created for all documents.

- Relevance to data stewardship: 
  - Ensures traceability and provenance through documented processes and translations.
  - Supports data quality and consistency via standardized interviewing practices and triangulation.
  - Improves metadata and usability through clear documentation of translation and transcription steps.
  - Facilitates reproducibility and auditability by maintaining organized backups and structured notes.
