# Details of data structure

- The dataset comprises 19 rich text format (rtf) documents, each containing transcripts from interviews conducted in a single village. All interviewees are anonymized.

- Focus Group Discussions (FGD)
  - Villages covered include Mahara, Mcunua, Natxoa, Nuisse, Moquito, Serra, Muhelo, Nakuphi, Namiepe, Palacue, and an emergent farmer group.
  - Group sizes range from 4 to 8 producers; compositions include both men and women, with one group listing a school coordinator or a secretario.
  - Each FGD lasted about 1 hour (with Namiepe lasting about 1.5 hours).
  - All FGDs were led by a researcher with a translator/assistant (Portuguese-Elomwe) and conducted in local languages with transcripts available in English.
  - Some FGDs used a 33-question catalogue; notes were often taken in Elomwe and later translated into Portuguese and English.
  - Data collection dates span October to November 2015.

- Interviews (non-FGD qualitative interviews)
  - TechnoServe: One open interview with a TechnoServe technician, about 1 hour, conducted 14.07.2015 in Portuguese; transcript available in English.
  - Traders: 
    - Interview_trader1: Multiple traders at buying points along main roads; about 10 minutes per interview; conducted in Portuguese; dates 11.07.2015–16.07.2015; transcript in English.
    - Interviews_trader2: Two informal traders in Gurue; about 20 minutes each; Portuguese; dates 22.10.2015 and 03.12.2015; transcripts in English.
    - Interview_trader.large: Manager of a larger trading company; questions answered in Portuguese and translated to English; dates 08.12.2015 and 03.12.2015; transcripts available in English and Portuguese.

    - Interview_company2: Another private soy-producing company; ~1.0 hours; 16.07.2015; English.
    - Interview_company3: Third private company management; ~1.5 hours; 08.07.2015; English.
  - SDAE Gurue:

- Language, translation, and data handling
  - Transcripts are primarily in English, with many source materials in Portuguese and Elomwe.
  - A translator/assistant (Portuguese-Elomwe) supported FGDs; some notes were taken in Elomwe and later translated.
  - Anonymization of interviewees is maintained; some datasets include original language notes, with translations available in English.
  - The dataset notes that open accessibility and metadata quality can be affected by multilingual transcription and translation processes.

- Data structure and provenance
  - Each document is labeled to reflect the data collection method (FGD or Interview) and the subject/group (e.g., FGD_Mahara, Interview_TechnoServe).
  - Dates and languages are recorded for each document, facilitating temporal analysis and cross-language comparison.
  - The materials collectively capture perspectives from small-scale soy producers, traders, company managers, technicians, and emergent farmers across multiple villages.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a multi-stakeholder qualitative baseline on small-scale soy production, market access, and actor perspectives within a village network.
  - Demonstrates practical data collection workflows relevant to monitoring framework pilots: use of FGDs and semi-structured interviews, multilingual data capture, and translation workflows.
  - Highlights the importance of anonymization, metadata, and transparent documentation when sharing dataset outputs and derived indicators.

- Limitations and considerations
  - Data are from 2015; applicability to current monitoring contexts may require updating or triangulation with newer sources.
  - Variability in language and translation may affect consistency across transcripts; careful metadata management is needed for reuse.
  - The qualitative nature and village-specific focus limit generalizability but are valuable for in-depth understanding of local dynamics and stakeholder relationships.
