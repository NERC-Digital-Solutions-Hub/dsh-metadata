## Language and translation

- Transcripts mainly in English, with source notes in Portuguese and Elomwe
- Translator/assistant involvement documented in several entries

## Temporal scope

- Data collection dates span July to December 2015, with most FGDs in October and November 2015 and interviews scattered across July, October, November, and December 2015
- Specific dates noted per document (e.g., 10.10.2015; 19.10.2015; 25.11.2015; 08.12.2015)

## Data quality and structure notes

- Anonymization of interviewees maintained
- Transcripts often involve translations from local languages to English
- Some outputs include early prototypes or notes, with potential for further refinement and reuse

## Potential data uses for Data Support

- Integrate these transcripts with other data sources to support exploratory analysis and data products
- Create dashboards or self-serve reports on supply chain insights, producer perspectives, and market dynamics
- Improve data collection and translation workflows for future multi-language qualitative datasets
