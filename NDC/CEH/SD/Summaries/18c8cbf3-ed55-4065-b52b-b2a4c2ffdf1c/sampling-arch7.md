# Sampling Design

## Period and study site
- Period: July 2015 – December 2015
- Study site: Gurue district, Zambezia province

## Village selection and rationale
- Built a land scarcity gradient from villages with abundant land to those with intense land constraints due to expanding agricultural activity and population density
- Ten villages selected along the gradient with similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation

## Identification of value chain actors
- Snowball sampling used to identify relevant actors
- Actors identified: village small-scale soya producers, emergent soya farmers, managers of commercial soy operations, district officer, NGO technicians, formal and informal traders

## Sampling strategy
- Small-scale soya producers: focus groups in all selected villages (group size 5–7 producers)
- Emergent farmers: identified via snowball sampling; one farmer to bring together colleagues for a focus group
- Informal traders: randomly interviewed at buying points along streets
- All other actors of interest: contacted for interviews
- Data collection methods: semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions
- Field logistics: interviews conducted on-site (village center, roads, plantation offices); translator (Portuguese to Elomwe) present; notes and later English electronic transcripts
- Triangulation: information validated by discussing topics with different groups/individuals and from multiple perspectives

## Data collection methodologies
- (Semi-)structured interviews: conducted in relevant action locations
- Focus group discussions: led by village leader, 1–2 hours
- Informal communications: ongoing daytime interactions; notes recorded; translator used
- Documentation and translation: notes in a notebook; electronic transcripts prepared later in English
- Guiding themes for interviews: soya production, soya marketing, land availability and distribution, agricultural inputs, constraints and challenges

## Guidelines and topics (Portuguese guide)
- Categories covered: Production, Marketing, Land (Terra), Contracts, Support (Apoio), Land allocation, Production inputs, Market dynamics, and related constraints
- Includes detailed questions for (i) large-scale soya-producing private companies and (ii) core topics such as crops grown, hectares used for soy, yields, inputs and suppliers, storage/processing, buyer profiles, prices and margins, contract terms, land tenure (DUAT), social/extension support, worker details, and governance aspects

## Data collection fields and structure
- Data collected per village and participant
- Topics include: year production started, motivations for starting soybean cultivation, presence of producer associations, donor/NGO projects, scale of production, land availability, deforestation considerations, yields per hectare, agronomic practices (soil management, seed inoculation, rotations, pests), input sources and costs, credit access, workers (temporary vs permanent), local soybean consumption, storage capacities, collective marketing, timing of sales, market destinations and buyers, pricing mechanisms, quality variations, and experiences with buyers, suppliers, and government
- Additional sections cover land allocation (how land was acquired, prior land use, conflicts, preferences for land, decision processes), inputs provisioning (sources, costs, credit, quality, and reuse for other crops), and market/processing/infrastructure (storage, processing, transport, contracts, margins, and risks)

Note on GIS relevance for this document
- Provides granular, field-level data points suitable for mapping: village locations, land scarcity gradient, hectares under soybean, DUAT status, land allocation and access, distances to markets and buyers, storage/processing facilities, and transport routes
- Values of multi-actor data collection and triangulation support robust spatial analyses of production, land use, and market flows across the study area
