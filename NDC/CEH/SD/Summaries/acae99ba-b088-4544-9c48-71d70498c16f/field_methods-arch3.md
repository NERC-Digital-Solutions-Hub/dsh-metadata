# Materials and methods

- Study design and sampling sites
  - Designed to represent different levels of endotoxin exposure: urban background (empty carpark near a dual carriageway), rural background near farmland (≥2.5 km from major towns), a composting facility processing green and food waste, and an intensive chicken farm (up to 23,000 chickens across 8 sheds; sampling conducted when 7 sheds were in use).
  - Sampling locations included: rural background near farmland, urban background near traffic, near windrows at the composting site (20–50 m from windrows), and boundary sampling 20–50 m from chicken sheds.
  - Sampling conducted in summer and winter.
  - Boundary and on-site sampling designed to capture varying exposure contexts around each site.

- Instrumentation and sampling protocol
  - Osiris particulate monitor used to measure total suspended particulates (TSP), PM10, and PM2.5; also logged temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction every minute; operated at 0.6 L/min for at least 30 minutes at each sample location, concurrently with bioaerosol sampling.
  - Two eight-stage non-viable Andersen samplers (GF/A filters) positioned 1 m above ground; connected to calibrated vacuum pumps (28.3 L/min); sampling consisted of at least three 1-hour runs per sampling day (yielding six filter sets).

- Sample processing and analysis
  - Endotoxin analysis:
    - Filters depyrogenated before sampling; post-sampling extraction using 30 mL (multi-filter) or 15 mL (single-filter) pyrogen-free water with shaking for 1 hour and 10 minutes of sonication.
    - Centrifugation to remove glass fibre; supernatant assayed for endotoxin using a kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay with Glucashield to prevent glucan interference.
    - Standard curve endotoxin range 50 to 0.005 EU/mL; 50 µL sample with 50 µL reconstituted lysate; 90-minute incubation at 37°C with 405 nm read.
    - Each sample assayed in duplicate.
  - Viable microorganisms:
    - On-site sampling using single-stage Andersen samplers with nutrient agar (NA), MacConkey agar (MAC), and malt extract agar (MEA) per AfOR Protocol (2009).
    - Plates prepared in advance; on-site exposure: 2 minutes (NA/MAC) or 10 minutes (MEA); four duplicates per location; field blanks (plates loaded but not exposed) and control plates included.
    - Incubation: NA/MAC at 37°C, MEA at 40°C to favor thermotolerant fungi (e.g., A. fumigatus); 48 hours plus a check at 3–4 days.
    - Counting: colonies counted with positive hole correction applied when >20 colonies on a plate; results expressed as colony-forming units per cubic metre of air (CFU/m3). LOD for viable microorganisms with single-stage Andersen samplers: 4 CFU/m3.

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Rigorous decontamination procedures for sampling equipment (e.g., depyrogenation of tools at 250°C for ≥4 hours).
  - Use of field blanks and control plates to monitor contamination.
  - Parallel processing of samples (duplicates for endotoxin; four duplicate bioaerosol samples per location).
  - On-site calibration and standardization of pump flow (28.3 L/min) and sampling conditions to ensure comparability across sites and times.

- Data outputs and reporting
  - Endotoxin concentrations reported in EU/mL from the LAL assay.
  - Viable microorganisms reported as CFU/m3.
  - Size fractionation for particulates: nine size fractions across ranges 10.0–5.8 µm, 5.8–2.1 µm, 2.1–0.43 µm, and <0.43 µm (filters processed to provide four stated ranges; actual analysis yielded nine size fractions).
