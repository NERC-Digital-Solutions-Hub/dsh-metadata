# Materials and methods

- Sites were chosen to represent different levels of endotoxin exposure, including:
  - Urban background site (empty carpark near a dual carriageway)
  - Rural background site (farmland, at least 2.5 km from major towns)
  - Composting facility (green waste and food waste; activities such as turning, screening, shredding)
  - Intensive chicken farm (up to 23,000 chickens across 8 sheds; sampling when birds were 12, 15, 21, and 27 days old; boundary sampling 20–50 m from sheds)
- Sampling timing:
  - Summer and winter sampling at multiple sites
  - Boundary sampling conducted 20–50 m from windrows or chicken sheds

- Instrumentation and measurements:
  - Osiris particulate monitor used to measure total suspended particulates (TSP), PM10, and PM2.5 via light-scattering
  - Osiris operated at 0.6 L/min for at least 30 minutes per location
  - Temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction logged every minute during the sampling period

- Air sampling for viable and non-viable organisms:
  - Two eight-stage non-viable Andersen samplers with GF/A filters
  - Filters connected to calibrated vacuum pump, operated at 28.3 L/min
  - Sampling day protocol included at least 3 × 1-hour runs, producing six filter sets per day
  - Pre-sampling decontamination: filters, tweezers, and glassware depyrogenated by heating to 250°C for ≥4 hours
  - On-site handling: filters transported in clean petri dishes and analyzed within 24 hours

- Endotoxin analysis (non-viable fraction):
  - Filters extracted with pyrogen-free water (30 mL for multiple filters, 15 mL for single filters)
  - Shaken for 1 hour, then sonicated for 10 minutes
  - Centrifugation to remove residual glass fibers; supernatant assayed for endotoxin via kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay
  - Plate-based assay setup: 50 µL sample mixed with 50 µL lysate (Glucashield to prevent glucan interference)
  - Standard curve: 50–0.005 EU/mL
  - Incubation: 37°C, 90 minutes; measurements read at 405 nm
  - Each sample assayed in duplicates

- Viable microorganisms (culture-based analysis):
  - Single-stage Andersen samplers used with:
    - Nutrient agar (NA)
    - MacConkey agar (MAC) No. 3
    - Malt extract agar (MEA)
  - Plates prepared in advance and loaded onto samplers; contaminated checks via ethanol-cleaned surfaces between runs
  - Sampling durations: NA and MAC for 2 minutes; MEA for 10 minutes
  - Field and control measures: four duplicate samples per location; field blanks (plates loaded but not exposed) and on-site purity controls
  - Incubation conditions:
    - NA and MAC: 37°C
    - MEA: 40°C (to favor thermotolerant fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus)
  - Incubation duration: 48 hours, with follow-up checks after 3–4 days
  - Colony counting: colonies counted and expressed as colony-forming units per cubic metre of air (cfu/m³); positive hole correction applied if >20 colonies per plate
  - Detection limit: 4 cfu/m³ for the single-stage Andersen sampler

- Data handling and quality assurance:
  - On-site contamination controls included control plates and field blanks
  - All samples compared to corresponding blanks to ensure purity
  - Samples analyzed on the same day as collection or per established AfOR protocol (for viable counts)

- Data types and reporting:
  - Endotoxin concentrations reported in EU/mL
  - Viable microorganism concentrations reported as cfu/m³
  - Size-fractionation for particulates included nine size fractions, consolidated into the following ranges: 10.0–5.8 µm, 5.8–2.1 µm, 2.1–0.43 µm, and <0.43 µm
  - Osiris-derived environmental parameters recorded (temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction) and correlated with sample locations and times
  - Documentation included sample location, sampling date/time, duration, site description, and methodological details to support reproducibility and data governance

- Standards and provenance:
  - Protocols aligned with established AfOR (Association for Organics Recycling) guidelines for viable sampling
  - Meticulous sample handling, decontamination, and duplicate measurements to support data integrity and traceability
