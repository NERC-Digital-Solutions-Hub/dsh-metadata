# PHE Endotoxin Analysis

## Overview
- Characterises bioaerosol emissions from commercial compost (PAS 100) and chicken litter using a 20 m^3 controlled test chamber.
- Runs involve aerosolising 25–50 g of material for 30 minutes under monitored temperature (22–24°C) and relative humidity (46–60%).

## Experimental Materials and Setup
- Materials: PAS 100 compost, chicken litter (visit 2), stored at 4°C.
- Sampling: eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler with GF/A glass fibre filters; nine initial size fractions consolidated to four ranges.
- Aerosol generation and distribution: purpose-built aerosol generator plus a fan for even distribution.
- Air flow: 28.3 L/min during 30-minute sampling per run.

## Sampling Procedure
- Repeats: multiple runs conducted with and without aerosolisation.
- Depyrogenation: filters, tweezers, and glassware heated to 250°C for at least 2 hours prior to sampling.
- Fractionation: nine size fractions initially; filters sometimes combined to yield four combined ranges: 10.0–9.0, 9.0–2.1, 2.1–0.43, <0.43.

## Endotoxin Extraction
- Filters removed and stored in 15 mL (single) or 40 mL (multiple) LAL water.
- Extraction: filters shaken for 1 hour at 25°C, then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 minutes; clear supernatant collected.

## Endotoxin Assay
- Method: kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay.
- Reagents: 50 µL of sample with 50 µL of lysate reconstituted with glucashield to prevent glucan interference.
- Standards: endotoxin standard curve from 5 to 0.005 EU/mL.
- Procedure: incubate at 37°C, read at 405 nm for 90 minutes.
- Replicates and controls: samples assayed in duplicates; includes pyrogen-free water blanks and controls.

## Data and Analysis Considerations
- Outputs: endotoxin concentrations per filter and per size fraction; certain filters combined to reduce complexity into four size ranges.
- Detection range: standard curve from 5 to 0.005 EU/mL informs concentration calculations.
- Notes: glucan interference mitigated with glucashield; pyrogen-free controls used to verify assay specificity.

## Quality Assurance and Reproducibility
- Rigorous decontamination and handling protocols (250°C depyrogenation, clean glassware).
- Duplicate testing and inclusion of blanks and controls to ensure data reliability.
