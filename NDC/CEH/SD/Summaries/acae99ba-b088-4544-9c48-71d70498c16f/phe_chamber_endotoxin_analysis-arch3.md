# PHE Endotoxin Analysis

## Objective and scope
- Characterises bioaerosol endotoxin emissions from commercial compost and includes a visit with chicken litter from an intensive farm.
- Conducted in a controlled 20 m3 test chamber; multiple experimental runs with and without aerosolisation; each run lasts 30 minutes.

## Experimental setup
- Materials: Final grade (PAS 100) compost and chicken litter stored at 4°C; 25–50 g per run aerosolised.
- Environment: Chamber temperature 22–24°C; relative humidity 46–60% during sampling periods.
- Aerosolisation and distribution: Purpose-built aerosol generator plus a fan for even distribution.

## Sampling, preparation, and storage
- Decontamination: Tweezers and glassware depyrogenated at 250°C for at least 2 hours.
- Sample collection: Endotoxin captured with an eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler using GF/A filters; flow maintained at 28.3 L/min for 30 minutes.
- Post-sampling handling: Filters stored in 15 mL or 40 mL of LAL water depending on single vs multiple filters; filters shaken for 1 hour at 25°C to extract endotoxin.
- Derived fractions: Nine size fractions obtained; some filters combined to yield four aggregated size ranges (10.0–9.0, 9.0–2.1, 2.1–0.43, and <0.43 μm).

## Endotoxin extraction and assay
- Extraction processing: Centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 minutes to clarify extract.
- Assay method: Kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay.
- Reagents: Lysate reconstituted with glucashield to prevent glucan interference.
- Measurement: 50 μL sample with 50 μL lysate in a 96-well plate; incubated at 37°C; read at 405 nm for 90 minutes.
- Standard curve: Endotoxin standards from 5 to 0.005 EU/mL.
- Replicates and controls: Each sample assayed in duplicate; appropriate controls and blanks included.

## Quality control and data handling
- Replicates and controls ensure measurement reliability.
- Detailed recording of method steps (depyrogenation, filtration, fractionation, incubation conditions) supports traceability and potential data governance considerations.
- Data produced: Quantified endotoxin concentrations for each size fraction, enabling assessment of size-resolved bioaerosol endotoxin emissions.
