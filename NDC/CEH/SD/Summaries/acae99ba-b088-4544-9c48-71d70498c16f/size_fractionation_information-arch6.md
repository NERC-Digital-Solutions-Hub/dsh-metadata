# The eight stage non-viable Andersen sampler was used for the size fractionation of endotoxin

## Objective
- Fractionate endotoxin by particle size using the eight-stage Andersen sampler.

## Method setup
- Eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler.
- Each stage loaded with a glass fibre filter.
- Two samplers run together for 1 hour per sample; exception: source sampling at compost and farm sites where 1 sampler is run for 15 minutes per sample.

## Size fractions (stages)
- Preseparator: >10.0 µm
- Stage 0: 9–10 µm
- Stage 1: 5.8–9 µm
- Stage 2: 4.7–5.8 µm
- Stage 3: 3.3–4.7 µm
- Stage 4: 2.1–3.3 µm
- Stage 5: 1.1–2.1 µm
- Stage 6: 0.65–1.1 µm
- Stage 7: 0.43–0.65 µm
- Backup filter: <0.43 µm
- CTL: Control Filter taken into the field and then extracted in the usual way (size fraction N/A)
- LNE: Loaded Not Exposed Filter loaded onto the Andersen without airflow and then extracted in the usual way (size fraction N/A)

## Data processing groups (analysis simplification)
- For ease of analysis, filters are analyzed together in size fractions:
  - 0-1: 5.8–10 µm
  - 2-4: 2.1–5.8 µm
  - 5-7: 0.43–2.1 µm
  - B/UP: <0.43 µm
  - CTL and LNE: N/A for size fraction analysis
- The sampling files contain additional details on each sampling visit.

## Run organization and data labeling
- Each set of filters is assigned a letter (A–F), with typical sequencing:
  - A and B run together in the first hour
  - C and D run together in the second hour
  - E and F run together in the third hour

## Additional notes
- Source sampling at compost and farm sites used 1 sampler for 15 minutes per sample.
- CTL and LNE serve as controls in the extraction process and are not assigned a size fraction designation.
