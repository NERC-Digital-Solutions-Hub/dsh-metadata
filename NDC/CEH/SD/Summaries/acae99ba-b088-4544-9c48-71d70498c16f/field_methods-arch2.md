# Materials and methods

## Study sites and sampling design
- Sites chosen to represent different levels of endotoxin exposure: urban background, rural background near farmland (≥2.5 km from major towns), a composting facility handling green and food waste, and an intensive chicken farm.
- Sampling locations: near compost windrows (summer and winter; 20–50 m from windrows) and boundary areas 20–50 m from chicken sheds.
- Chicken farm sampling: during active periods, 7 of 8 sheds used; chickens sampled at 12, 15, 21 and 27 days old.
- Seasonal coverage: sampling conducted in both summer and winter.

## Instrumentation and measured parameters
- Particulate monitoring: Osiris instrument measured total suspended particulates (TSP), PM10, PM2.5, and logged temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction every minute; operated at 0.6 L/min for at least 30 minutes per location.
- Bioaerosol sampling (non-viable): Two eight-stage non-viable Andersen samplers (GF/A filters) operated at 28.3 L/min, placed ~1 m above ground; sampling included at least 3 x 1-hour runs per day (yielding 6 filter sets daily).
- Size fractionation: nine size fractions across filters (10.0–5.8, 5.8–2.1, 2.1–0.43, >0.43 µm).
- Veiled QA controls: control filters without pump operation and routine blanks to check contamination.

## Sampling procedures
- Pre-sampling decontamination: tweezers and glassware depyrogenated at 250°C for ≥4 h.
- Transport and processing: filters transported in clean containers and analyzed within 24 h.
- Endotoxin extraction: combined filters with 30 mL (multiple) or 15 mL (single) pyrogen-free water; shake 1 h at room temperature, then sonicate 10 min; centrifuge to remove residual glass; supernatant used for LAL assay.
- Endotoxin analysis: kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay with Glucashield to prevent glucan interference; 50 µL sample + 50 µL lysate; standard curve 50–0.005 EU/mL; incubate 37°C, read at 405 nm for 90 min; samples assayed in duplicate.

## Endotoxin data processing
- Endotoxin concentrations calculated from standard curve; expressed in EU/mL.

## Viable microbiology (bioaerosol) analysis
- Sampling: single-stage Andersen samplers used with nutrient agar (NA), MacConkey agar No. 3 (MAC), and malt extract agar (MEA).
- On-site handling: plates prepared in advance; exposed for 2 minutes (NA/MAC) or 10 minutes (MEA); duplicate sampling at each location; field blanks and control plates included; equipment cleaned between runs with 70% ethanol.
- Incubation and identification: plates incubated and checked at 48 h, then 3–4 days at 37°C for bacteria and 40°C for fungi (to favour thermotolerant fungi like A. fumigatus); colonies counted; positive hole correction applied when >20 colonies per plate.
- Output: colony forming units per cubic metre (CFU/m3) calculated; LOD for viable microorganisms with single-stage Andersen sampler is 4 CFU/m3.

## Data quality assurance and handling
- Rigorous decontamination, use of blanks/control plates, and immediate lab processing (within 24 h) to minimize contamination.
- Standardized calibration and flow stabilization (pump set to 28.3 L/min; pre-run warm-up) to ensure consistency across sampling days.
- Data generated include particulate concentrations (TSP, PM10, PM2.5), environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind), endotoxin concentrations (EU/mL), and viable bioaerosol concentrations (CFU/m3) across diverse environmental settings and seasons.
