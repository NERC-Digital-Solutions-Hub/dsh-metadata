# The eight stage non-viable Andersen sampler was used for the size fractionation of endotoxin.

## Objective
- Size-fractionate endotoxin using an eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler and prepare combined fractions for analysis.

## Experimental setup
- Eight-stage Andersen sampler; each stage loaded with a glass fibre filter.
- Two samplers run together for 1 hour per sample; for source sampling at compost and farm sites, 1 sampler run for 15 minutes per sample.
- Stage order and size ranges:
  - Preseparator
  - Stage 1: >10.0 µm
  - Stage 2: 9–10 µm
  - Stage 3: 5.8–9 µm
  - Stage 4: 4.7–5.8 µm
  - Stage 5: 3.3–4.7 µm
  - Stage 6: 2.1–3.3 µm
  - Stage 7: 1.1–2.1 µm
  - Stage 8: 0.65–1.1 µm
  - Backup filter: <0.43 µm
  - CTL (Control Filter taken into the field and then extracted in the usual way)
  - LNE (Loaded Not Exposed Filter loaded onto the Andersen without airflow and then extracted)

## Size-fraction grouping for analysis
- Filters analyzed together in the following size fractions:
  - 0-1: 5.8–10 µm
  - 2-4: 2.1–5.8 µm
  - 5-7: 0.43–2.1 µm
  - B/UP: <0.43 µm
  - CTL and LNE: not applicable (N/A)

## Sampling and data handling
- Each set of filters was assigned a letter (A–F). Generally:
  - A and B run together for the first hour
  - C and D for the second hour
  - E and F for the third hour
- Sampling files contain additional details for each sampling visit.

## Notes
- The document references additional information available in the sampling files for each visit.
