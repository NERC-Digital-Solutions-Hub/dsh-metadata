# Materials and methods

- Study design and sites
  - Selection representing different endotoxin exposure levels: urban background, rural background, a composting facility, and an intensive chicken farm.
  - Rural background near farmland (≥2.5 km from major towns); urban background in an empty car park ~100 m from a dual carriageway.
  - Composting facility processes green and food waste; sampling near compost windrows during turning, screening, shredding; occasional waste delivery or compost removal.
  - Intensive chicken farm with up to 23,000 chickens across eight 60 x 20 m sheds; sampling when chickens were 12, 15, 21, and 27 days old; boundary sampling 20–50 m from sheds.
  - Sampling occurred in summer and winter.

- Instruments and environmental measurements
  - Osiris particulate monitor for airborne particle concentrations and environmental variables; measures TSP, PM10, PM2.5; logs temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction every minute.
  - Two eight-stage non-viable Andersen samplers with GF/A filters; calibrated pump and flow 28.3 L/min; sampler height and placement aimed at human breathing zone (1.5 m) with stagnation-point design.

- Sampling procedures
  - Filters prepared and decontaminated before sampling; on-site handling minimized contamination with ethanol-treated surroundings.
  - On each sampling day: at least 3 x 1-hour runs for filters; six filter sets per day; field blanks and blanks routinely processed.
  - Boundary and site-specific sampling distances maintained as described.
  - On-site plate sampling for viable organisms using single-stage Andersen samplers; four duplicate plates per location; media included nutrient agar (NA), MacConkey (MAC), and malt extract agar (MEA).

- Endotoxin analysis workflow
  - Filters extracted with pyrogen-free water; shaking for 1 hour, followed by 10 minutes of sonication.
  - Debris removed by centrifugation; supernatant assayed for endotoxin using kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay.
  - Standard curve with reference endotoxin (50 to 0.005 EU/mL); incubated at 37°C with 405 nm readout for 90 minutes.
  - Each sample assayed in duplicate.

- Viable microorganisms sampling and culture
  - Plates incubated per AfOR Protocol (2009) with NA, MAC, and MEA media.
  - Plates exposed for 2 minutes (NA, MAC) or 10 minutes (MEA); four duplicates per location; field controls and blanks included.
  - Incubation conditions: 37°C (bacteria) and 40°C (thermotolerant fungi) for 3–4 days; colonies counted and adjusted using positive hole correction when exceed 20 colonies per plate.
  - Outcome expressed as colony forming units per cubic meter of air (CFU/m3); limit of detection for single-stage Andersen set at 4 CFU/m3.

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Depyrogenation and contamination controls implemented at multiple stages; inline-flow meter calibration; pumps warmed to ensure stable flow.
  - On-site sterilization steps and controlled sampling environment to minimize cross-contamination; controls included field blanks and control plates.
  - Immediate lab processing of samples; identical timing for endotoxin and viable microorganism analyses where applicable.

- Data outputs and metrics
  - Environmental particle concentrations (TSP, PM10, PM2.5) and environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, wind) from Osiris.
  - Bioaerosol metrics: endotoxin concentration (EU/mL) from LAL assay; viable microorganism counts (CFU/m3) by size-fraction filtering and culture.
  - Size-resolved fractions for endotoxin and viable counts and corresponding detection limits.
  - Documentation includes sampling locations, dates, times, flow rates, exposure durations, and analytical conditions to support reproducibility.

- Data management implications for data leaders
  - Comprehensive, site-diverse data collection strategy enabling assessment of endotoxin exposure variability across environments.
  - Standardized procedures, replicates, and controls to ensure data quality, traceability, and comparability.
  - Rich metadata (sites, dates, times, environmental conditions, sampling protocols, analytical methods) to support discoverability, reuse, and integration with broader data ecosystems.
  - Clear documentation of data processing steps (e.g., positive hole correction, LAL standard curves, incubation conditions) to facilitate transparency and future replication.
