# Materials and methods

- Study design and sites
  - Sites chosen to represent varying endotoxin exposure: urban background, rural background, composting facility, and an intensive chicken farm.
  - Sampling conducted in summer and winter; boundary sampling 20–50 m from windrows (compost) or sheds (chicken farm); urban site in a nearby empty car park about 100 m from a dual carriageway; rural site near farmland at least 2.5 km from major towns.
  - Chicken farm configuration: up to 23,000 chickens across 8 sheds; sampling occurred when chickens were 12, 15, 21, and 27 days old.

- Instrumentation and environmental measurements
  - Osiris particulate monitor (light-scattering) to measure total suspended particulates (TSP), PM10, and PM2.5; also logged temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction every minute; operated at 0.6 L/min for ≥30 minutes per location.

- Airborne microbiology sampling
  - Two eight-stage non-viable Andersen samplers with GF/A 81 mm filters; flow set to 28.3 L/min; sampling performed for 1 hour per run, with at least 3 runs per day (yielding 6 filter sets per day).

- On-site sample handling and decontamination
  - Filters, tweezers, and glassware depyrogenated by heating to 250°C for ≥4 hours.
  - After sampling, filters transported to the lab in clean containers and analyzed within 24 hours.
  - Field controls and blanks included to monitor contamination.

- Endotoxin analysis
  - Endotoxins extracted by mixing filters with 30 mL (multiple filters) or 15 mL (single filters) of pyrogen-free water; shaken for 1 hour, then sonicated for 10 minutes.
  - Suspended endotoxin transferred, centrifuged to remove glass fibre, supernatant assayed using kinetic chromogenic LAL assay with Glucashield to prevent beta-glucan interference.
  - Standard curve prepared with endotoxin standards from 50 to 0.005 EU/mL.
  - Plate incubated at 37°C with a 405 nm readout for 90 minutes; each sample assayed in duplicate.

- Viable microorganisms analysis
  - In accordance with AfOR Protocol (2009): NA, MAC, and MEA plates prepared on site.
  - Plates loaded into Andersen samplers on a treated surface; inline-flow meter calibrated; sampling times: 2 minutes for NA/MAC, 10 minutes for MEA.
  - Four duplicate samples per location; field blanks and control plates included; plates incubated the same day.
  - Incubation conditions: 48 hours, then 3–4 days at 37°C for bacteria and 40°C for fungi (to favor thermotolerant fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus).
  - Colony counts converted to colony-forming units per cubic meter (CFU/m³); positive hole correction applied if colonies exceed 20 on a plate.
  - Detection limit for viable microorganisms with single-stage Andersen sampler: 4 CFU/m³.
