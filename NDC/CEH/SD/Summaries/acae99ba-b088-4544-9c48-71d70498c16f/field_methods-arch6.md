# Materials and methods

- Objective and approach
  - Assess endotoxin and bioaerosol exposure across diverse site types using particulate monitoring and culture-based microbial analysis.
  - Combine physical air measurements with chemical (endotoxin) and microbiological (viable organisms) data to enable exposure assessment and cross-site comparisons.

- Study sites
  - Rural background site: near farmland, at least 2.5 km from major towns.
  - Urban background site: empty car park ~100 m from a dual carriageway.
  - Composting facility: processes green and food waste; activities include turning, screening, shredding; sampling 20–50 m from windrows during summer and winter.
  - Intensive chicken farm: up to 23,000 chickens across eight 60 × 20 m sheds; sampling when chickens are 12, 15, 21, and 27 days old; boundary sampling 20–50 m from sheds.

- Sampling instruments and data streams
  - Osiris particulate monitor
    - Measures total suspended particulates (TSP), PM10, and PM2.5 via light scattering.
    - Operated at 0.6 L/min for at least 30 minutes per location, concurrently with bioaerosol sampling.
    - Logs temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction every minute.
  - Andersen samplers (two eight-stage non-viable samplers)
    - Head height ~1 m above ground; mounted with calibrated vacuum pump at 28.3 L/min.
    - Sampling schedule: at least 3 × 1-hour runs per sampling day (total of 6 filter sets per day).
    - Boundary and site-specific sampling distances as noted above.

- Sample handling and preparation
  - Contamination control: depyrogenation of tweezers and glassware at 250°C for ≥4 hours; field blanks and untreated controls used.
  - On-site and lab workflow: filters transported in clean containers and analyzed within 24 hours of sampling.
  - Filter treatment: nine size fractions extracted from filters (10.0–5.8, 5.8–2.1, 2.1–0.43, and <0.43 μm).
  - Blanks and controls: control filters (exposed to sampler without pump) and blanks routinely included.

- Endotoxin analysis
  - Extraction: filters mixed with either 30 mL (multi-filter) or 15 mL (single-filter) pyrogen-free water; shaken 1 hour at room temperature; sonicated 10 minutes; centrifuged to remove glass fiber.
  - Assay: kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay with Glucashield to prevent glucan interference.
  - Detection: 50 μL sample added to 96-well plate with lysate; standard endotoxin curve from 50 to 0.005 EU/mL.
  - Reading: plate incubated at 37°C; absorbance read at 405 nm for 90 minutes.
  - Replication: each sample assayed in duplicate.

- Viable microorganisms analysis
  - Sampling and culture media: single-stage Andersen samplers used with nutrient agar (NA), MacConkey agar (MAC), and malt extract agar (MEA) per AfOR Protocol (2009).
  - Plate preparation and handling: media prepared in advance; plates loaded in clean area; exposed using a flow-calibrated pump; within-field contamination controls employed.
  - Exposure times: NA and MAC for 2 minutes; MEA for 10 minutes.
  - Incubation: plates incubated and checked at 37°C (bacteria) and 40°C (fungi) to favor thermotolerant fungi such as A. fumigatus.
  - Replicates and controls: four duplicate samples per location; field blanks and control plates included; plates incubated on-site and returned to the lab for analysis the same day.
  - Output: colony-forming units per cubic meter (CFU/m^3); use of positive-hole correction when colonies exceed 20 per plate.
  - Detection limit: LOD for viable microorganisms with single-stage Andersen sampler = 4 CFU/m^3.

- Data quality, processing, and integration
  - QA/QC: contamination controls (blanks, field controls), standardized decontamination procedures, duplicate endotoxin assays, and duplication in microbial counts.
  - Data alignment: concurrent Osiris particulate data with endotoxin and viable microorganism measurements across sites and days to enable cross-variable analyses.
  - Reporting units: endotoxin in EU/mL; particulate concentrations in μg/m^3 (via PM measurements); CFU/m^3 for viable organisms; and size-resolved fractions for aerosols.
