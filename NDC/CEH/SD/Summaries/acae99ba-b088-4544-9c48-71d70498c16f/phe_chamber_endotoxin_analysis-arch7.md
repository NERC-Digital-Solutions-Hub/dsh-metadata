# PHE Endotoxin Analysis

## Overview
- Characterises bioaerosol emissions from compost (and chicken litter on visit 2) in a controlled 20 m3 chamber.
- Endotoxin concentrations determined across multiple particle-size fractions using a kinetic chromogenic LAL assay.
- Data generated include environmental conditions, sampling details, and endotoxin measurements suitable for downstream mapping or spatial analyses in GIS contexts.

## Experimental Setup and Materials
- Chamber: 20 m3 volume; controlled environment.
- Materials: final grade (PAS 100) compost and chicken litter (visit 2); stored at 4°C.
- Sampling framework: eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler with GF/A 81 mm glass fibre filters.
- Conditions: temperature 22–24°C; relative humidity 46–60%.

## Sampling Procedure
- Aerosol generation: 25–50 g of compost or chicken litter aerosolised with a purpose-built generator; distribution aided by a fan.
- Experimental runs: 30 minutes each; included periods with and without aerosolisation; multiple repeats.
- Flow and timing: sampler operated at 28.3 L/min for 30 minutes per run.
- Inlet preparation: filters and glassware depyrogenated at 250°C for ≥2 hours prior to sampling.

## Sample Handling and Preparation
- Post-sampling: filters stored in 15 mL of LAL water (single filters) or 40 mL (multiple filters).
- Fractionation: nine size fractions obtained; some filters combined to reduce to four size ranges: 10.0–9.0, 9.0–2.1, 2.1–0.43, and <0.43 μm.
- Endotoxin extraction: filters shaken for 1 hour at 25°C; liquid centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 minutes to remove glass fibre; clear supernatant collected.

## Endotoxin Measurement
- Assay: kinetic chromogenic LAL assay.
- Procedure: 50 μL sample + 50 μL reconstituted lysate with glucashield (to prevent glucan interference) in a 96-well plate.
- Standards: control standard endotoxin from 5 to 0.005 EU/mL.
- Incubation: 37°C, 90 minutes; read at 405 nm.
- Replication and controls: each sample assayed in duplicate; include pyrogen-free water controls and blanks.

## Data Characteristics and Quality Assurance
- Data outputs: endotoxin concentrations per sample and per fraction/range; includes material type (compost vs. chicken litter) and aerosolisation status.
- Data integrity: depyrogenation steps, duplicate measurements, and inclusion of controls/blanks to ensure assay validity.
- Fractionation detail: explicit mapping of size fractions to broader ranges to support comparative analysis.

## GIS Relevance and Potential Data Uses
- Spatial/size-resolved data within a controlled chamber can be represented as multi-layer maps showing endotoxin concentration by particle size under different materials and aerosolisation conditions.
- Metadata (material type, temperature, humidity, sampling workflow) enables temporal or scenario-based GIS analyses for exposure assessment and policy-relevant visualization.
- Potential to integrate with other GIS datasets to model dispersion and public health risk in broader environmental contexts.
