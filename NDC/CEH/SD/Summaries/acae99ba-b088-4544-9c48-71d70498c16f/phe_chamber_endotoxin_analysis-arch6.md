# PHE Endotoxin Analysis

- Objective and setup
  - Characterised bioaerosol endotoxin emissions from commercial compost in a 20 m³ test chamber; included chicken litter from an intensive farm for Visit 2.
  - Timeframe: multiple experimental runs with periods of no aerosolisation and aerosolisation; each run lasted 30 minutes.
  - Conditions: chamber temperature 22–24°C; relative humidity 46–60%.

- Materials and aerosol generation
  - Final grade compost (PAS 100) stored at 4°C; chicken litter also stored at 4°C.
  - 25–50 g of material aerosolised with a purpose-built aerosol generator.
  - Distribution aided by a fan; replicates conducted with repeated sampling.

- Sampling, fractionation, and data collection
  - Depyrogenation: tweezers and glassware heated to 250°C for at least 2 hours prior to sampling.
  - Endotoxin collection: eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler with GF/A glass fibre filters; flow maintained at 28.3 L/min for 30 minutes.
  - Sample handling: filters stored in 15 mL (single) or 40 mL (multiple) of LAL water.
  - Fractionation: nine size fractions obtained; some filters combined to yield four broader ranges (10.0–9.0, 9.0–2.1, 2.1–0.43, and <0.43 μm).
  - Extraction: filters shaken 1 hour at 25°C; liquid clarified by centrifugation (1000 × g, 15 min).

- Endotoxin measurement (data generation)
  - Assay: kinetic chromogenic LAL (Limulus Amebocyte Lysate) with glucashield to prevent glucan interference.
  - Procedure: 50 μL sample + 50 μL lysate per well in a 96-well plate; incubation at 37°C with 405 nm readings for 90 minutes.
  - Calibration and controls: standard curve from 5 to 0.005 EU/mL; controls and blanks using pyrogen-free water.
  - Replicates: each sample assayed in duplicate.

- Data products and potential analyses
  - Primary outputs: endotoxin concentration (EU/mL) per sample and per size fraction; data derived from kinetic plate readings and standard curve.
  - Data handling: fractionated data can be compiled to compare emissions with and without aerosolisation and between compost and chicken litter.
  - Quality/Reliability: inclusion of duplicates, blanks, and pyrogen-free controls; measures taken to prevent glucan interference.
