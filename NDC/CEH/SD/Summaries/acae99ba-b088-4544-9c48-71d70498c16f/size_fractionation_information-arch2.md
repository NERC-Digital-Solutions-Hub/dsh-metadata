# The eight stage non-viable Andersen sampler was used for the size fractionation of endotoxin.

## Overview
- Describes the use of an eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler to size-fractionate endotoxin.
- Filters (glass fibre) are loaded in each stage; sampling schedules vary by site.

## Experimental Setup
- Two Andersen samplers run together for 1 hour per sample (except at compost and farm sites, where 1 sampler runs for 15 minutes per sample).
- Stages include: Preseparator, and stages 0–7 with size fractions defined as:
  - >10 µm (Preseparator)
  - 9–10 µm (Stage 0)
  - 5.8–9 µm (Stage 1)
  - 4.7–5.8 µm (Stage 2)
  - 3.3–4.7 µm (Stage 3)
  - 2.1–3.3 µm (Stage 4)
  - 1.1–2.1 µm (Stage 5)
  - 0.65–1.1 µm (Stage 6)
  - 0.43–0.65 µm (Stage 7)
  - <0.43 µm (Backup Filter)
- CTL (Control Filter) and LNE (Loaded Not Exposed) are included in the setup but are not analyzed as exposed samples.

## Size Fractionation Scheme (for analysis)
- To reduce sample burden, filters are analyzed in combined size fractions:
  - 0-1: 5.8–10 µm
  - 2-4: 2.1–5.8 µm
  - 5-7: 0.43–2.1 µm
  - B/UP: <0.43 µm

## Sampling Schedule and Run Pairing
- Each set of filters is assigned a letter:
  - A and B run together for the first hour
  - C and D run together for the second hour
  - E and F run together for the third hour
- The sampling files contain additional details for each sampling visit.

## Data Handling and Documentation
- The procedure yields endotoxin size-distribution data across defined micron ranges.
- Site-specific adjustments exist (15-minute sampling at compost and farm sites).
- Sampling files provide per-visit context to support interpretation and QA/QC.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring (Analysts)
- Demonstrates a standardized method for collecting and fractionating environmental endotoxin data, supporting consistent health and policy monitoring over time.
- Data are organized into consistent size fractions, enabling cross-site comparisons.
- Emphasizes the value of documenting per-visit sampling details and maintaining traceable run configurations (lettered sets) for data integrity and reproducibility.
- Highlights the importance of storing and linking underlying sampling data (filter sets, run timings) to enhanced dataset utility and potential data sharing.
