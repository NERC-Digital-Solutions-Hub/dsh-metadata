# PHE Endotoxin Analysis

## Overview
- Characterisation of bioaerosol endotoxin emissions from compost and chicken litter in a controlled 20 m^3 test chamber.
- Uses final grade (PAS 100) compost and chicken litter stored at 4°C; aims to determine endotoxin concentrations across size-fractionated aerosols.
- Endotoxin quantified by kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay; results produced as EU/mL per size fraction.

## Experimental Setup
- Materials and conditions:
  - 20 m^3 chamber; compost and chicken litter aerosolised with a purpose-built aerosol generator.
  - 25–50 g per run; distribution aided by a fan; runs include aerosolisation and no-aerosolisation; each run lasts 30 minutes.
  - Temperature 22–24°C; relative humidity 46–60%.

## Sampling and Fractionation
- Depyrogenation:
  - Tweezers, glassware heated to 250°C for at least 2 hours prior to sampling.
- Sampling apparatus:
  - Eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler with GF/A 81 mm glass fibre filters.
  - Flow maintained at 28.3 L/min for 30 minutes.
- Sample handling:
  - After sampling, filters placed in LAL water (15 mL for single filters, 40 mL for multiple).
  - Some filters combined to reduce fractionation profile (target fractions: 10.0–9.0, 9.0–2.1, 2.1–0.43, <0.43 μm).
- Extraction:
  - Filters shaken for 1 hour at 25°C to extract endotoxin.
  - Extracted liquid clarified by centrifugation (1000 x g, 15 minutes).

## Endotoxin Assay
- Assay method:
  - Kinetic chromogenic LAL assay.
  - 50 μL sample + 50 μL lysate with glucashield to prevent glucan interference.
  - Standard curve with endotoxin concentrations from 5 to 0.005 EU/mL.
  - Incubation at 37°C, reading at 405 nm for 90 minutes.
  - Each sample assayed in duplicate; include pyrogen-free water controls and blanks.

## Quality Assurance and Data Handling
- Rigorous decontamination and handling procedures to prevent contamination.
- Use of duplicates, appropriate controls, and standard curves to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.
- Data produced include endotoxin concentrations for each size fraction, enabling standardized reporting and downstream integration with environmental monitoring datasets.

## Outputs and Reproducibility
- Multi-fraction endotoxin concentration data per experimental run.
- Methodology supports standardized data generation suitable for reporting, comparison across runs, and potential integration with broader environmental health datasets.

## Relevance to Environmental Monitoring (Analyst Perspective)
- Demonstrates a standardized workflow for characterising bioaerosol endotoxin emissions from agricultural materials.
- Emphasises data quality assurance, traceability, and clear outputs (fractionated endotoxin concentrations) for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Aligns with goals of making datasets more valuable and accessible for reuse and integration with other environmental data sources.
