# The eight stage non-viable Andersen sampler was used for the size fractionation of endotoxin.

## Objective
- Describe the use of the eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler to fractionate endotoxin by particle size.

## Methods (Sampler and sampling protocol)
- Equipment: Eight-stage Andersen sampler loaded with glass fibre filters; two samplers run together per sample for 1 hour, except for source sampling at compost and farm sites where 1 sampler runs for 15 minutes per sample.
- Size-fractionation scheme (stages and µm ranges):
  - Preseparator >10.0
  - Stage 1: 9–10
  - Stage 2: 5.8–9
  - Stage 3: 4.7–5.8
  - Stage 4: 3.3–4.7
  - Stage 5: 2.1–3.3
  - Stage 6: 1.1–2.1
  - Stage 7: 0.65–1.1
  - Stage 8: 0.43–0.65
  - Backup filter: <0.43
- Simplified data analysis fractions:
  - 0-1: 5.8–10
  - 2-4: 2.1–5.8
  - 5-7: 0.43–2.1
  - B/UP: <0.43
  - CTL (Control Filter): N/A for size fraction
  - LNE (Loaded Not Exposed Filter): N/A for size fraction

## Data organization and labeling
- Each set of filters assigned a letter, with parallel runs:
  - A and B conducted during the first hour
  - C and D during the second hour
  - E and F during the third hour
- Sampling files contain detailed information for each sampling visit.

## Data quality and governance considerations
- Documentation of size-fraction assignments and sampling timing is essential for traceability.
- CTL and LNE controls have no specified size fraction, highlighting the need to manage metadata accordingly.
- Grouping of filters into broader size fractions aids analysis but requires clear mapping back to original stage data.
- Source-site sampling variations (15-minute runs) should be captured in metadata to ensure comparability across sites.

## Practical implications for data leadership
- Emphasize rigorous data provenance: record stage-to-fraction mappings, run times, and sample pairings.
- Maintain clear metadata for controls and special-site procedures to prevent misinterpretation.
- Ensure data systems support linking of sampling files, filter assignments (A–F), and final aggregated fractions for downstream analysis.
