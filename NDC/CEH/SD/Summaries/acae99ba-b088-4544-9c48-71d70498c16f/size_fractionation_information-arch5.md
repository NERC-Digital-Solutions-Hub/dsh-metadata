# The eight stage non-viable Andersen sampler was used for the size fractionation of endotoxin.

## Purpose and Method
- Used to size-fractionate endotoxin samples with an eight-stage Andersen sampler.
- Each stage loaded with a glass fibre filter; two samplers run together for 1 hour per sample (except at compost/farm source sampling where 1 sampler runs for 15 minutes per sample).

## Size Fractions by Stage
- Preseparator
- Stage 0: >10.0 µm
- Stage 1: 9–10 µm
- Stage 2: 5.8–9 µm
- Stage 3: 4.7–5.8 µm
- Stage 4: 3.3–4.7 µm
- Stage 5: 2.1–3.3 µm
- Stage 6: 1.1–2.1 µm
- Stage 7: 0.65–1.1 µm
- Stage 8 (Backup filter): <0.43 µm
- (Control and non-exposed filters included for field extraction and testing)

## Data Consolidation for Analysis
- Filters analyzed in reduced size-fraction groups:
  - 0-1: 5.8–10 µm
  - 2-4: 2.1–5.8 µm
  - 5-7: 0.43–2.1 µm
  - B/UP: <0.43 µm
  - CTL: N/A
  - LNE: N/A

## Sampling and Documentation Details
- Each filter set assigned a letter (A/B run together first hour; C/D second hour; E/F third hour).
- Sampling files contain more detailed visit information.
- Indicates a structured labeling and time-sequenced approach to data collection.

## Data Management and Governance Considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure complete metadata: instrument type (eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler), stage-to-size mappings, unit (µm), sampling durations, and pairing scheme (A/B, C/D, E/F).
- Capture notes on deviations (e.g., 15-minute sampling at source sites) to maintain data provenance.
- Document data reduction approach (consolidation into 0-1, 2-4, 5-7, B/UP) for consistent downstream analysis.
- Include field controls (CTL, LNE) and their handling status (N/A in this excerpt) for transparency.
- Prepare data for sharing by aligning with standard ontologies and ensuring sampling files contain visit-level context.
