# PHE Endotoxin Analysis

- Purpose and scope
  - Characterisation of bioaerosol emissions from compost and chicken litter in a controlled 20 m3 test chamber.
  - Compare emissions with and without aerosolisation across multiple experimental runs.
  - Size-fractionated sampling to determine endotoxin distribution across particle sizes.

- Experimental materials and conditions
  - Final grade (PAS 100) compost and chicken litter (visit 2) stored at 4°C.
  - Aerosol generation using a purpose-built aerosol generator; distribution aided by a fan.
  - Each run: 25–50 g of material aerosolised; run duration 30 minutes; environmental range 22–24°C and 46–60% relative humidity.

- Sampling and particle sizing
  - Endotoxin collected with an eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler using GF/A glass fibre filters on each stage.
  - Flow maintained at 28.3 L/min for 30 minutes per sampling period.
  - Nine size fractions obtained; combined to approximate four ranges: 10.0–9.0, 9.0–2.1, 2.1–0.43, and <0.43 µm.

- Sample handling and preparation
  - Depyrogenation of tweezers and glassware at 250°C for ≥2 hours.
  - Post-sampling filters stored in 15 mL or 40 mL of LAL water (depending on filter group).
  - Endotoxin extraction: filters shaken for 1 hour at 25°C; centrifuged at 1000 x g for 15 minutes to clarify.

- Endotoxin measurement (LAL assay)
  - Kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay.
  - 50 µL sample + 50 µL lysate reconstituted with glucashield to mitigate glucan interference.
  - Standard curve: 5–0.005 EU/mL.
  - Incubation: 37°C with 405 nm detection for 90 minutes.
  - Each sample assayed in duplicate; controls and blanks included.

- Data collected and processing
  - Endotoxin concentrations derived for each size fraction (and compiled into the four fraction ranges).
  - Some filters were extracted together to reduce the fractionation profile.
  - Analytical workflow includes decontamination steps, replication, and inclusion of controls/blanks to support data quality.

- Data quality and governance considerations for data leaders
  - Rigor of decontamination and handling to prevent contamination.
  - Use of duplicates and controls to ensure assay reliability.
  - Clear documentation of sampling conditions (material type, aerosolisation status, chamber conditions) to support data provenance.
  - Metadata requirements: sample identifiers, run numbers, material type, fraction range, extraction details, and assay parameters for reproducibility.
  - Data interoperability: standardized fractionation ranges and consistent assay methodology to enable cross-study comparisons.
