# The eight stage non-viable Andersen sampler was used for the size fractionation of endotoxin

## Method overview
- An eight-stage non-viable Andersen sampler with glass fibre filters was used to size-fractionate endotoxin.
- Filters were loaded per stage, and two samplers were run together for 1 hour per sample (except at compost and farm sites, where 1 sampler was run for 15 minutes per sample).
- A backup filter was included for <0.43 µm fraction.

## Sampling protocol
- Source sampling at compost and farm sites used shorter 15-minute runs per sample.
- Each set of filters was assigned a letter (A–F) to indicate concurrent runs: A and B for the first hour, C and D for the second hour, and E and F for the third hour.
- The sampling files provide additional site- and visit-specific details.

## Size fractionation details
- The eight stages fractionate into:
  - Preseparator
  - Stage 0: >10.0 µm
  - Stage 1: 9–10 µm
  - Stage 2: 5.8–9 µm
  - Stage 3: 4.7–5.8 µm
  - Stage 4: 3.3–4.7 µm
  - Stage 5: 2.1–3.3 µm
  - Stage 6: 1.1–2.1 µm
  - Stage 7: 0.65–1.1 µm
  - Backup filter: <0.43 µm
- For analysis, filters were pooled into broader size fractions to reduce sample count:
  - 0-1: 5.8–10 µm
  - 2-4: 2.1–5.8 µm
  - 5-7: 0.43–2.1 µm
  - B/UP: <0.43 µm
  - CTL and LNE are labeled as controls (CTL and LNE), but size fraction is not applicable (N/A).

## Data handling and labeling
- Each filter set was given a letter designation (A–F) to coordinate simultaneous runs.
- The 0–1, 2–4, and 5–7 fractions were created to streamline analysis and reporting.
- CTL (Control Filter) was collected in the field and extracted in the usual way; LNE (Loaded Not Exposed) was prepared by loading onto the Andersen without airflow.
- CTL and LNE have size-fraction N/A.

## Quality control and governance considerations
- The protocol supports traceability through stage-specific fractions, run timing, and per-site adjustments.
- Shorter sampling at some sites introduces potential comparability considerations.
- Metadata inclusion (site, visit, run letter, and fraction) is essential for data transparency and reuse.
- Data sharing and metadata completeness are important for ensuring datasets meet quality and governance standards.
