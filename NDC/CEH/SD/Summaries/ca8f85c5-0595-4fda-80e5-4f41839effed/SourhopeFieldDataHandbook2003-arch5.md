# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Aim and Scope
- Documents baseline field data for the Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Programme at a single experimental site (Rigg Foot, Sourhope) with long-term, multi-faceted data collection.
- Data support analysis of soil–plant–microbial interactions under varied treatments and environmental conditions.
- Provides comprehensive vegetation and soil data, metadata, archival links, and guidance for data governance and reuse.

## Data Types and Content
- Vegetation data
  - Presence/absence records for plant species across plots/subplots; species codes and dominance by plot.
  - Data structured to enable classification (e.g., NVC associations, Twinspan groups) and indicator species analysis.
- Soil data
  - Soil profiles describing horizons (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx) with depth ranges and narrative descriptions (color, texture, structure, roots).
  - Chemical and physical properties by horizon: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI), pH (H2O and CaCl2), and Mg/other cations.
  - Auger core data (0–30 cm) per plot with the same parameters as horizon data.
  - Archival horizon descriptions and per-horizon measurements linked to MLURI barcodes.
- Experimental design and treatments
  - Five blocks (1–5) with main plots labeled A–F; initial treatments include Control, Lime, Nitrogen (N), Lime+N, Biocide, and Fallow (later adjusted).
  - Nested subplots layout (within each main plot) and management practices (grazing exclusion, cutting regimes, fencing).
- Data coding and provenance
  - Standardized identifiers: block, plot, subplot, horizon, sample IDs; barcoded archival samples.
  - Data include both raw observations (presence/absence; horizon measurements) and derived metrics (C:N, LOI, etc.).

## Experimental Design and Data Structure
- Location and Setup
  - Sourhope field site on Rigg Foot slope (approx. 309 m a.s.l.), with five north–south blocks on a slope; each block contains six main plots (A–F) and a nested 15-subplot sampling framework.
- Treatments and Sampling
  - Initial treatments: Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Lime & Nitrogen, Biocide; Fallow design initially, with subsequent revisions.
  - Management: regular cutting (every three weeks) with removal of cuttings; grazing largely excluded since late 1990s; fencing to prevent grazing.
  - Sampling cadence (e.g., vegetation and soil sampling in August 1998) with selective subplots targeted for analyses.
- Outputs and Documentation
  - Tables and appendices summarize species occurrence (Tables 2–5), plot-level composition, dominance, and block-level summaries; horizon- and block-specific soil data (Tables 6–9; Appendices).
- Data structure and archiving
  - Data organized by block/plot/subplot and horizon; barcoded samples stored and linked to archival IDs; emphasis on reproducibility and re-analysis.

## Methods and Sampling
- Vegetation sampling
  - 50 × 50 cm quadrats within five of the fifteen subplots per main plot; 25 sampling points per quadrat; data capture includes presence/absence with potential abundance inference.
  - Analyses via Twinspan, National Vegetation Classification (NVC) matching (U4d and related subcommunities), and association analyses.
- Soil sampling
  - 0–30 cm auger cores (approximately 30 cores per plot in a W-pattern) blended to a plot sample.
  - Profile pits (1 m or deeper) for horizon description and horizon-specific sampling.
  - Archival samples stored at -80°C (CEH Merlewood); barcoded horizon data linked to samples.
- Data processing and quality
  - Statistical analyses include Twinspan groupings, NVC matching, and association analyses; notes on data limitations due to partial subplot sampling and block anomalies.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Provenance
- Limitations
  - Subplot coverage varied (some analyses used only a subset of subplots); some blocks showed anomalous soil values (Ca, Na, Mg, pH patterns).
  - Data captured at a single baseline time point (1998) with implied future longitudinal data not included in this handbook.
- Variability and interpretation
  - Dominant grass species largely consistent across plots; indicator species identified for analyses.
  - Local microhabitat variation (drainage, moisture, horizon properties) influences measured parameters, necessitating careful normalization when comparing blocks.
- Provenance and archiving
  - Documentation and authorship: Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003 (multiple authors).
  - Metadata include precise grid references, altitude, slope, drainage class, soil series, parent material, and rock type.
  - Archiving: soil samples stored at CEH Merlewood (-80°C); horizon/barcode linkage preserved; data linked to NVC/Twinspan classifications.

## Metadata, Archiving, and Publishing
- Provenance and metadata
  - Detailed location metadata (grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material, rock type) to support discoverability and reuse.
  - Horizon nomenclature and operational codes standardized; sample IDs and barcodes ensure traceability.
- Archiving and access
  - Raw and derived data are archived with linkage to archival IDs; physical samples linked to digital records.
  - Recommendations for publishing include DOIs/persistent identifiers, data narratives, versioning, and clear usage licenses.
- Interoperability and standards
  - Data aligned with ecological classification schemes (NVC, Twinspan) and standardized vegetation/horizon coding to facilitate integration with other datasets.
  - Encourage data dictionaries mapping codes to full species names and horizon symbols; explicit measurement units and calibration details.

## Data Governance, Standards, and Interoperability
- Governance and discoverability
  - Rich multi-modal dataset (vegetation and soil chemistry) across a well-defined experimental design, with explicit metadata and archival linkage.
  - Supports discoverability, reuse, and reproducibility across research networks with large dataset holdings.
- Standards and interoperability
  - Use of standardized vegetation codes, horizon nomenclature, and soil property units; crosswalks to classification schemes (NVC, Twinspan) for harmonization.
  - Need for consistent data dictionaries, metadata schemas, and documentation of measurement methods, units, and calibration.

## Recommendations for Data Stewards
- Documentation and schemas
  - Create comprehensive data dictionaries and metadata schemas covering spatial metadata (block/plot/subplot/horizon), sampling dates, methods, taxonomic metadata (codes to species names and synonyms), soil properties, and treatment assignments.
- Archiving and access
  - Preserve digital data and physical samples with linkage to archive IDs; provide usage licenses, citation requirements, and access notes.
- Interoperability and standards
  - Align with community standards for soil and vegetation data; map codes to full names; standardize units and detection limits; publish as structured datasets with provenance narratives.
- Longitudinal and quality enhancements
  - Document sampling coverage metadata for each block/plot; flag anomalous blocks with explanatory notes; integrate longitudinal follow-up data and changes in treatments over time.
- Data quality improvements
  - Encourage complete subplot coverage or explicit coverage metadata; ensure DOIs/persistent IDs for datasets and archived samples; maintain versioned data releases.
