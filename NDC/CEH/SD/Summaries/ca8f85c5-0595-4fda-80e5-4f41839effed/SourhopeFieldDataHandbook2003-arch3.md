# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Documentation of the Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Site baseline and experimental data collected for the Soil Biodiversity Programme.
- Aims to study soil-vegetation interactions, biodiversity in upland grassland, and long-term environmental change to inform policy and land-management decisions.

## Site background and context
- Location: Sourhope Experimental Farm (north of Kelso), with blocks and varied elevations; soils include brown forest soils, gleys, peats, and stony soils, underlain by andesitic lavas.
- History: Previous work under HRFO/MLURI focused on hill sheep production, pasture improvement, liming/fertiliser use, and grazing strategies; cobalt/copper deficiency noted.
- Climate: Humid Euoceanic climate with significant annual rainfall and seasonal temperature variation.
- Land cover and use: Predominantly grassland with moor, conifer blocks; managed for hill sheep, cattle, goats; genetic studies on elite goats and wool traits.
- Facilities: On-site offices, MLURI laboratories, hostel, computer network; ECN (Environmental Change Network) and Micronet involvement for long-term measurements.

## Research program and objectives
- Long-term focus on sustainable systems balancing agricultural production and environmental objectives.
- Projects include management of Nardus pastures, grazing effects on floristic change, diet selection of grasses by herbivores, wool production traits, and parasite resistance.
- ECN and Micronet involvement to measure soil, air, water quality and biodiversity; aim to link soil microbial/plant communities to nutrient cycling, productivity, ecological diversity, and policy outcomes.

## Experimental design and monitoring framework
- Establishment: 1998 on the north-facing slope of Rigg Foot at ~309 m above sea level.
- Layout: Five blocks (1–5), each with six main plots (12 x 20 m) and designated subplots (A–F) within each plot; Ecotron plot included for controlled environment studies.
- Treatments (main plots):
  - Control
  - Lime applied annually
  - Nitrogen added (NH4NO3, twice yearly)
  - Lime + Nitrogen
  - Biocide
  - Fallow (reallocated as needed)
- Grazing: Annual sheep grazing historically; plots fenced to exclude grazing during the experiment.
- Sampling scope: Vegetation and soil sampling across blocks with stratified layout to capture gradient and slope position; some analyses sampled only a subset of subplots.

## Vegetation sampling and analysis
- Sampling method: 50 x 50 cm point quadrats across randomly selected subplots; 25 points per quadrat; presence/absence data used (with potential abundance inference).
- First survey: July 1998.
- Analyses:
  - Twinspan to identify frequent co-occurring species and community patterns.
  - National Vegetation Classification (NVC) matching; most plots designated U4d (Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland) with Luzula multiflora-Rhytidiadelphus loreus subcommunity.
  - Indicator species identified (e.g., Deschampsia flexuosa, Agrostis canina, Ranunculus repens, Carex binervis, Juncus effusus).
- Key findings:
  - Dominant species include Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta, Poa pratensis; Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus widespread.
  - Species richness varies along slope (up to 17 species in some plots; lower in others).
  - Community structure centers on a core grass group; edge vs interior plot differentiation with localized associations (e.g., D. flexuosa with Molinea caerulea).
  - Some plots near block boundaries approach adjacent NVC communities (e.g., near U5b).

## Soil sampling and analysis
- Sampling design:
  - 0–30 cm auger cores: 30 cores per plot, collected in a W-pattern; bulked to form plot samples.
  - Profile pits: 1 m pits above each block to describe horizons and collect horizon samples.
  - Archival samples prepared for immediate analysis and storage at -80°C (CEH Merlewood).
- Chemical and physical analyses:
  - Variables: weight, %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Typical results (0–30 cm): acidic pH ~4.6, LOI ~16%, %N ~0.5%, %C ~7–8%; Ca and Mg dominate cation exchange; K and Na lower; depth-related pH rise and higher LOI in surface horizons.
  - Inter-block variation: notable differences in Ca, Na, Mg, and pH between blocks; some blocks show anomalies.
- Statistical findings:
  - Strong correlations: %N with %C and LOI; %C with %N, C:N, Na, Mg, LOI.
  - Multivariate patterns (PCA) indicate most variation explained by %N, %C, C:N, Ca, K, Mg, LOI, moisture loss; pH forms a smaller axis.
- Profile results:
  - Horizons described as FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, BCx, C, with textures and moisture regimes indicating brown forest soils with gleying in some blocks.
- Block-level data (examples):
  - Block 4 and Block 5 profiles show horizon structure, elemental concentrations, pH, LOI, and moisture dynamics; auger samples provide horizon-specific chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, pH).

## ECN and data management
- Sourhope is a core ECN site measuring soil, air, water quality, and biodiversity for long-term environmental change.
- Data and samples are archived and shared according to project plans (archival storage at CEH Merlewood).
- Metadata quality and data governance are emphasized; open data sharing is pursued but can be a barrier, requiring data provenance, standardization, and governance frameworks.

## Block-level data highlights (Sourhope blocks 4 and 5)
- Detailed soil profiles and analyses for blocks 4 and 5 show substantial horizon-specific variation in texture, color, structure, moisture, pH, and nutrient content.
- Auger samples provide granular, horizon-level chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na) and physicochemical properties (LOI, moisture loss, pH).
- Vegetation data at the sub-plot and plot level illustrate species presence/absence patterns and community composition across blocks and plots.

## Limitations and monitoring considerations
- Sampling scope: Only about one-third of subplots sampled for vegetation analyses; results are indicative rather than exhaustive for the site.
- Data richness vs accessibility: Extensive data collected across vegetation, soils, horizons, and chemistry; data sharing can be constrained by metadata quality and governance requirements.
- Spatial heterogeneity: Significant block- and horizon-level variability in soils and microclimate necessitates careful stratification and cautious extrapolation in monitoring frameworks.
- Long-term integration: The site’s ECN linkage and long-term data make Sourhope valuable for informing policy on land management, extensification, and biodiversity conservation; robust data governance and archiving are essential to maximize utility.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Emphasize multi-layer data (vegetation, soil chemistry, horizons) and long-term continuity.
- Prioritize high-quality metadata, standardized data formats, and transparent data governance to enable data sharing and reuse.
- Manage and document spatial heterogeneity through stratified sampling and block-level analyses.
- Leverage Sourhope as a benchmark site within broader environmental monitoring networks to inform policy decisions on land-use changes and biodiversity targets.
