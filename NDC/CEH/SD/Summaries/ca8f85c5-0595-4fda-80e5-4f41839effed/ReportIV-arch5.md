# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme Sourhope Site Summary of Activity 2002

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on an intensive field experiment at Sourhope to study soil biodiversity and the links to above-ground plant communities.
- Primary monitoring targets: above-ground biomass production (productivity), plant species composition, and relative abundance (diversity); site management drives major botanical changes.

## Experimental design and data collected

- Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
- Plots: each block contains 6 main plots; main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells used for research group allocation.
- Treatments (randomized): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA).
- Management actions (since 1999): monthly mowing to ~6 cm; insecticide application after mowing on insecticide plots; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime on designated plots.
- Data collection (since 1998–1999): 
  - Weather: on-site Automatic Weather Station (Feb 1999 onward).
  - Above-ground productivity: regular clipping from 0.5 m2 cells, dried and weighed.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998 (0.5 m2 quadrat, 25-point); annual July/August point analyses in 2000, 2001, 2002 using 100-point grid within a 0.5 m2 cell; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
  - Soil measurements: soil pH at ~5 cm depth; soil moisture (theta probe) at the botanical survey cells (Aug 2002).
  - Additional small-scale surveys: vegetation cover in small squares, biomass sorting by species, disturbance plots, etc.
- Data management and scope: 16 phase I projects plus Phase II fieldwork; soil samples totalled 11,621 from start to 2002; several datasets and appendices document treatments, plots, species, weather, and biomass data.

## Key findings by theme

- Mowing effect
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across most treatments.
  - Festuca rubra expanded, particularly in fertile (N and/or lime) plots.
  - Bryophytes expanded across the site, aided by a ~6 cm sward height maintained by mowing and the absence of grazing.
  - Stress-tolerant plant species expanded in unfertilised plots; disturbance reduction (no grazing) influenced community structure and diversity.

- Fertilisation effect
  - Biomass productivity increased in plots with nitrogen and/or lime; the strongest productivity in plots with both N and lime.
  - Soil pH in limed plots rose toward ~7.0; high lime rates may be linked to potential chlorosis and reduced soil moisture under certain conditions.
  - In fertilised plots, functional groups shifted: CSR-type (competitive-stress tolerators) increased with higher pH and more benign growth conditions; stress-tolerant species remained prominent in unfertilised plots.
  - The relationship between pH and biomass varied by treatment; N-only plots showed different patterns than lime-influenced plots.

- Insecticide effect
  - Shannon diversity (plant diversity) was highest in insecticide-treated plots, suggesting herbivore interactions may influence plant community structure.
  - While a direct causative link is not definitively established, the data align with expectations that altering herbivory can affect diversity.

- Trampling effect
  - In 2002, production declines in newly surveyed C2 plots likely reflect trampling during periods of 13CO2 pulse experiments rather than treatment effects alone.

- Community composition and functional groups
  - PCA and point analysis reveal clear separation between improved (fertilised/limed) and unimproved plots.
  - Bryophyte hits increased in most treatments, especially unimproved plots; moss abundance rose relative to vascular plants in several years.
  - Shifts in functional groups (stress-tolerators, CSR/CS-R, SR/CSR) became statistically significant by 2002, with fertilised plots favouring competitive-stress combinations and unimproved plots favouring stress-tolerators.

- Biomass and productivity patterns
  - Long-term trend shows increasing biomass across treatments since 1999, though 2002 biomass generally lower than 2001 in many plots.
  - Block location on the slope affected productivity, with lower productivity higher on the slope (Block 5 vs Block 1).

## Data quality, gaps, and governance considerations

- Data richness and heterogeneity
  - Multiple data types across years: biomass, point analysis, bryophyte IDs, species lists, soil pH, soil moisture, weather data, and 13CO2-related experiments.
  - Clear documentation of measurement methods, sampling design, and treatment allocations (Appendix 1 and 2; Appendix 3 species lists; Appendix 5 weather data; Appendix 6 biomass; Appendix 7 biomass rankings; Appendix 8 species rank data).

- Data quality challenges and gaps
  - 2002 weather station malfunction caused missing data for July–November; Konza weather station data used as substitutes for missing periods.
  - Control 2 plots had limited survey years (not surveyed in 2000–2001); careful handling required for cross-year comparisons.
  - Some datasets are highly aggregated (e.g., annual biomass by plot) and require careful metadata for re-use.

- Metadata and data standardization needs (implications for Data Stewards)
  - A consistent data dictionary covering: plot/block IDs, treatment codes, year, measurement units, and methods.
  - Taxonomic harmonization: formal species codes and full taxonomic names (Appendix 3) to ensure cross-year comparability.
  - Documentation of data processing: use of log transformations (biomass for ANOVA) and derived metrics (percentage of Control baselines, PCA scores).

- Data accessibility and discoverability
  - Datasets are embedded in a project report with extensive appendices; consider packaging into a formal data repository with DOIs, data dictionaries, and access notes.
  - Linkages between datasets (biomass, point analysis, bryophytes, soil properties, weather) should be maintained to enable integrated discovery.

## Datasets, documentation, and provenance

- Core datasets to preserve and publish
  - Above-ground biomass by plot (1999–2002) and cumulative biomass (1999–2002).
  - Point analysis survey results (2000–2002), including species hits by treatment and bryophyte components.
  - Bryophyte and vascular plant species lists (Appendix 3).
  - Soil pH measurements (5 cm depth) and their temporal changes per plot.
  - Soil moisture measurements at botanical survey cells (Aug 2002).
  - Weather data from the on-site station (1999–2002) with notes on missing periods.
  - 13CO2 pulse experiment data (Field activity notes; related data in Phase II studies).
  - Dataset metadata describing plots, blocks, subplots, and treatments (Appendix 1–2).

- Provenance and methods
  - Documented site layout, randomization, and treatment allocation (Appendix 1).
  - Detailed methods for biomass clipping, drying, and weighing; point analysis methodology; bryophyte identification approach (Section 2; Appendix 3).
  - Statistical analyses described (split-plot ANOVA, PCA) and year-by-year results (Figures and Tables in Results/Discussion).

## Practical recommendations for data stewardship

- Create a consolidated data package
  - Combine raw data and derived metrics into a single, well-documented repository.
  - Include data dictionaries, codebooks, and a data provenance file describing measurement methods, units, and transformations.

- Standardize metadata and taxonomic references
  - Use a consistent taxonomy reference for all plant and bryophyte names; provide a mapping to Appendix 3 codes.
  - Define plot identifiers (Block, Plot, Sub-plot, Cell) and treatment codes with stable IDs for cross-year linkage.

- Ensure data quality and traceability
  - Maintain QA checks for missing data (e.g., weather gaps) and document any substitutions or imputations.
  - Preserve both raw (e.g., untransformed biomass weights) and derived data (e.g., ln-transformed biomass; treatment-normalized biomass).

- Plan for data sharing and discoverability
  - Publish datasets with DOIs and include a data usage license.
  - Provide user-friendly summaries linking datasets (biomass, species, soil, weather) to facilitate reuse by data users with diverse needs.

- Maintain governance for ongoing updates
  - Establish a clear schedule for future data uploads (post-2002) and version control.
  - Document any changes to measurement protocols or plot management that could affect data comparability.

## Endnotes and references within the study context

- The study provides a comprehensive, multi-year dataset linking management practices (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide), plant community dynamics (including bryophytes), and soil conditions (pH, moisture) with productivity outcomes.
- The data reveal robust treatment effects on biomass and species composition, with notable long-term trends and treatment-dependent functional-group shifts.
- These insights, alongside the detailed appendices, offer rich opportunities for meta-analysis and cross-site comparisons but require careful data governance to enable reliable reuse.
