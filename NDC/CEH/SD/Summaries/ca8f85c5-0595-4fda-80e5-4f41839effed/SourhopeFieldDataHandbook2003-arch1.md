# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- A comprehensive record of the Sourhope field site focusing on long-term soil–vegetation relationships in upland grasslands.
- Documents site history, climate, geology, soils, vegetation, land use, research agenda, and the experimental framework used to study soil and vegetation dynamics.
- Aims to enable data-driven analysis, cross-study comparisons, and data discoverability through structured metadata and documentation.

## Site context and key characteristics
- Location: Sourhope Farm, Bowmont valley, Scotland; altitude 213–605 m; humid upland climate with mean annual rainfall ~952 mm.
- Geology/Soils: Old Red Sandstone andesitic lavas; soils range from acid brown forest soils to peat-derived variants and stony skeletal soils on steeper slopes.
- Land use and facilities: Predominantly grassland with moor and conifer areas; on-site labs, accommodation, and network linkages to larger research infrastructure.
- Research programme: Long-term ecological and agricultural experiments focused on indigenous vegetation management, sustainable hill grazing, soil microbial–plant interactions, and genetic studies (e.g., cashmere goats, wool production).

## Experimental design and site layout
- Primary site: Rigg Foot, established 1998 on a north-facing slope; divided into blocks and plots with a controlled design.
- Structure: Five blocks (1–5) containing multiple plots (e.g., 12 × 20 m main plots subdivided into 4 × 4 m subplots; additional Ecotron plots for controlled-environment studies).
- Treatments (main plot level): Control, Lime, Nitrogen (NH4NO3), Lime + Nitrogen, Biocide, and originally Fallow (not continued); randomised within blocks.
- Grazing history and fencing: Stock excluded during certain periods; peripheral fauna present; mammal-proof fencing implemented around the experimental area.
- Ecotron component: An 8 × 24 m Ecotron plot with 12 subdivisions for controlled environment studies.

## Vegetation data collection and classification
- Plot-level vegetation sampling: 50 × 50 cm quadrats scattered across randomly selected subplots; 25 points per quadrat recorded for presence/absence and abundance.
- Temporal scope: Early surveys conducted in 1998; site characteristics noted for seasonal variability and shifts in dominance.
- Species and diversity: Richness around 25 recorded species per area; dominant taxa include Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, and Nardus stricta; richness tends to increase downslope.
- Vegetation classification: Association analyses (Twinspan) and comparisons with National Vegetation Classification (NVC) systems.
  - Primary pattern: Four principal groups of associated species.
  - NVC mapping: Majority of plots align with U4d (Festuca ovina–Agrostis capillaris–Galium saxatile grassland; Luzula multiflora–Rhytidiadelphus loreus subcommunity). A moister subset aligns with U5b (Nardus stricta–Galium saxatile grassland) in damp areas.
- Indicator and associations: Key indicator species include F. ovina, R. repens, D. flexuosa, and H. mollis; edge plots show particular associations; moister/damp areas show distinct patterning.

## Soil sampling, analyses, and horizon data
- Sampling methods: Auger sampling (0–30 cm) in a W-pattern per plot; one horizon profile pit per block to describe horizons and profile characteristics; horizon samples archived for analysis.
- Measured soil properties: Texture and structure observations, horizon descriptions, pH (water and CaCl2), moisture loss (LOI), %N, %C, C:N ratio, and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) across horizons.
- Horizon progression: Profiles labeled FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, BCx, C, with detailed descriptions of color, structure, moisture, root presence, and stone content.
- Block-specific soil chemistry: 
  - General trends include acidic surface horizons (pH ~4.5–4.8), high LOI indicating organic matter content, and variable N and C contents by horizon.
  - Exchangeable cations show Ca as most abundant, Mg following, with generally low Na; pH correlates with Ca and Mg.
  - Notable block-to-block variation: Blocks 4 and 5 often show anomalous values requiring consideration in analyses.
- Auger sample chemistry: Individual auger samples (4A–4F; 5A–5F) include %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, LOI, moisture loss, pH, and other metrics; provides high-resolution, horizon-level data to complement main plots.
- ECOTRON soil site: Dedicated ECOTRON plot data include a separate soil analysis (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH) and a parallel vegetation survey.

## Data management, accessibility, and documentation
- Data archiving and provenance: Early data management involved plot and horizon sampling archives; data linked to ECN/MLURI/CEH frameworks to support cross-study analyses.
- Metadata and discoverability: Emphasis on making datasets discoverable with metadata and structured data presentation; appendices provide block-by-block soil and vegetation data, horizon descriptions, and laboratory measurements.
- Appendices and detailed data: Appendix A consolidates block-level soil and vegetation data, site details, horizon descriptions, and per-horizon laboratory measurements; ECOTRON and Block 5 datasets are included with detailed per-plot and per-horizon records.

## Key takeaways for data-driven analysis
- The Sourhope site provides a well-structured, multi-block experimental framework with controlled treatments and long-term sampling to explore soil–vegetation relationships in upland grasslands.
- Vegetation patterns show a stable core community with clear slope and moisture gradient associations; UVC/NVC designations (notably U4d as the primary group) aid comparability across plots.
- Soil data reveal strong links between soil organic matter (LOI), nitrogen and carbon contents, and exchangeable cations, with horizon- and block-level variation that must be accounted for in comparative analyses.
- The integrated dataset supports analyses of management treatments (lime, nitrogen, biocide) on both plant communities and soil chemistry over time, enabling correlations and predictive insights about action impacts.
- The documentation emphasizes data quality, traceability, and accessibility to enable reuse and cross-study synthesis.
