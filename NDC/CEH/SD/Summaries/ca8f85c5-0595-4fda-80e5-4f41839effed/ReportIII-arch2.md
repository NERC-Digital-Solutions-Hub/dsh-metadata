# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- A large-scale field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme to monitor environmental conditions and policy-relevant outputs over time.
- Monitoring was designed to provide a broad context for detailed studies, using standardized methods to enable year-to-year comparisons and linking with other research groups.
- Data types collected annually include automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, with plots subjected to different nutrient and management treatments.

## Monitoring framework and site context

- Established at Sourhope Farm, with a Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998) guiding monitoring and experimental design.
- Measurements and dates aligned with Report II to facilitate cross-year comparisons and data linkage.
- Data management included storage and uploading to appropriate data portals; standardized analyses (ANOVA, PCA) used to interpret results.

## Notable 2001 events affecting management

- Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May 2001) limited site visits; post-May sampling proceeded under a government-approved protocol and an Officer in Charge.
- Site management plan largely maintained; minor disruption included missing the first biocide application in May.
- Change of site officer in May 2001.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather largely unremarkable; rainfall near long-term averages (839 mm in 2001, following a very wet year previously).
- Total annual radiation similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than in prior years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- A consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak biomass typically in July–August.
- 2001 biomass estimates were substantially higher than in 1999–2000, likely due to a combination of personnel change and the switch from manual to mechanical mowing in 2001.
- Biomass normalized to the C1 control showed sustained positive effects of nitrogen and/or lime, with the Nitrogen and Lime treatments most effective.
- ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year × treatment interaction; no significant block effect.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime continued to raise soil pH in the top 5 cm: average pH 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (Aug 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat survey showed 58% more “hits” than 2000, suggesting a denser sward, possibly due to reduced grazing since 1998.
- Treatment differences in species composition:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001.
  - Festuca species (F. ovina, F. rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide or N & Lime plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) favored Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis; unimproved plots (Control, Biocide) retained more acid-tolerant species (e.g., Agrostis capillaris, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
- Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting possible diversity decline with high fertility.
- PCA showed clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; improved plots corresponded to more extreme PCA positions.
- Abundance-biomass relationships: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes tended to decline as biomass increased.
- Increased litter in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime indicated faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F exhibited more acidic plots, likely influenced by plot composition (many controls/biocide in those columns) and slope orientation.
- Biomass across plots varied, with higher biomass often in centrally located plots (e.g., certain Nitrogen and Lime plots).
- A strong positive correlation existed between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks detected.

## Data, methods and accessibility

- Data collection schedule summarized (Table 1) with multiple measurements per year:
  - Above-ground biomass: five mowing events per summer; plots sampled using 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots S, T, U, V.
  - Botanical surveys: mid-summer using Point Quadrat frames; 100 cells per grid, with species touches recorded.
  - Soil pH, moisture and temperature data from the Automatic Weather Station and soil samples (0–5 cm depth).
- Analytical approaches: split-plot ANOVA for biomass by year and treatment; PCA for botanical composition; correlation analyses between biomass and species abundance.
- Data management involved regular data transfer to the MLURI data manager and consistent documentation of field methods.

## Conclusions and implications for monitoring

- Nutrient (nitrogen) and lime inputs shift plant communities toward more productive, fertility-associated species, increase biomass, and raise soil pH, with associated changes in species composition and litter dynamics.
- There is clear spatial heterogeneity within the site that influences biomass and community responses, which underscores the importance of accounting for site structure in monitoring and analysis.
- Despite external disruption (FMD), the monitoring framework produced year-to-year comparisons and demonstrated the value of standardized, multi-metric environmental monitoring for evaluating ecological responses to management and policy-relevant interventions.
