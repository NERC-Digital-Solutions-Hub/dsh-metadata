# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Aimed to provide a contextual monitoring framework for broader groups, enabling links to other data and year-to-year comparisons.
- Document outlines experimental design, data types, collection timing, and management implications; notes disruptions in 2001 due to Foot and Mouth restrictions and a change of site officer.

## Monitoring scope and data types
- Automatic Weather Station
  - Continuous weather measurements on site (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture).
  - 1999–2001 trends: 2001 rainfall near long-term average after very wet 2000; soil moisture and temperatures detailed; data transmitted to CEH Data Manager.
- Above-ground biomass
  - Biomass harvested from plots across five mowing occasions each summer; data used to compare treatments and years.
  - 2001 biomass higher than previous years, likely due to personnel change and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Normalization against a reference plot (C1) to isolate treatment effects; ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; notable year-by-treatment interactions.
- Soil pH
  - Soil pH measured in the top 5 cm; lime and nitrogen (N) additions raise pH, with limed plots reaching higher pH (e.g., around 6.19 in October 2001; 6.38 in N+L plots).
  - Control plots show little change since baseline (1998).
- Botanical composition
  - Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) to assess species abundance; robust cross-surveyor consistency (no significant difference between surveyors).
  - 2001: total species hits increased by 58% vs 2000; shifts in dominant species across treatments.
  - Improvements with N and/or Lime: Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis more abundant; reductions in Agrostis capillaris across treatments.
  - Unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) show higher species richness (24) than improved plots (18) in 2001.
  - Principal Components Analysis separates improved plots (N and/or L) from unimproved plots; biomass correlates positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, negatively with Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
  - Increased litter with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover at higher soil fertility.
- Site heterogeneity
  - Spatial variation observed: some right-hand columns exhibit more acidic conditions and different vegetation patterns.
  - Biomass distribution shows central plots often with higher biomass; strong positive correlation between surface pH and biomass.

## Management and data collection context
- Measurement schedule and methods detailed in Table 1; e.g., mowing schedules, biomass harvest, and point quadrat surveys.
- Weather data collected locally and uploaded; site management impacted by FMD restrictions (visitor access limited Feb–May 2001) and a change of site Officer in Charge.
- Data handling
  - Data management and QA processes implied (e.g., data collation by a named Data Manager; use of Genstat 5 for analyses; cross-year comparisons and normalizations).

## Key implications for monitoring framework design
- Treatment effects and interactions
  - Nitrogen and lime consistently boost productivity; combining N and lime yields the strongest biomass response.
  - pH shifts due to lime/N have downstream effects on plant community composition and litter production.
- Biodiversity considerations
  - Fertilized plots tend toward species associated with improved pastures; diversity appears to decline slightly in the most improved plots, while unimproved plots maintain higher species richness.
- Temporal and logistical factors
  - Changes in management (e.g., cutting method) can substantially affect measurements; normalization and calibration against reference plots are essential for year-to-year comparability.
- Spatial heterogeneity
  - Site-wide heterogeneity must be accounted for in design and analysis (blocked design, spatial correlations) to avoid confounding treatment effects.
- Data governance and accessibility
  - Centralized data collection (weather data to Data Manager) and rigorous measurement protocols support transparency and future reuse.
  - The architecture highlights the importance of metadata completeness, consistent protocols, and clear documentation to facilitate data sharing and reproducibility.
