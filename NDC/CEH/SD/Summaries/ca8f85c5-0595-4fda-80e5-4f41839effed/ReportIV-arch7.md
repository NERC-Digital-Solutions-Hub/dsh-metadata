# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report 2002

- Four-year summary of the Sourhope field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on above-ground biomass production, plant species composition, and diversity.
- Site context: Sourhope farm, Scottish Borders; site fenced from grazing in 1998; mowing regime introduced in 1999 (approx. 6 cm sward height); five prescribed plot-level treatments (Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime) and an insecticide treatment; 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient.
- Key aim for botanical work: assess how management (fertility, liming, mowing, insecticide) alters productivity, species composition, and functional group structure (CSR framework).

## How the study was conducted (Methods)

- Site structure:
  - 5 replicate blocks; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m × 0.5 m sampling cells used for data collection.
  - Treatments allocated randomly; 16 projects across Phase I and II.
- Management steps (yearly since 1999):
  - Mowing: monthly May–Sept to ~6 cm, across the whole site.
  - Insecticide: Dursban 4 OPA applied to insecticide plots after mowing.
  - Fertilisation: nitrogen and/or lime added to designated plots in spring (and lime occasionally with higher rates).
- Data collection:
  - Weather: on-site Automatic Weather Station (Feb 1999 onward).
  - Above-ground productivity: harvests from random 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots S, T, U, V; samples dried at 80°C and weighed; data collected since 1999.
  - Baseline vegetation: 1998 0.5 m2 baseline survey; later surveys use 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid (point analysis) in 2000, 2001, 2002.
  - Point analysis: 25-point baseline, then 100-point grid per cell in 2000–2002; bryophytes identified to higher taxonomic detail in 2002.
  - Soil measures: soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe in 2002); additional soil data collected for various studies.
  - Other surveys: vegetation cover in small squares; biomass by species; various small-scale botanical surveys (2000–2002).
- Data handling:
  - Analysis includes split-plot ANOVA (logged biomass) with treatment, year, and interaction terms; PCA on point analysis data; diversity indices (Shannon) computed from point analysis data.

## What the results show (Results)

- 3.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2002: low rainfall in April and September, wetter periods in February, July, and late-year; winter 2001/02 was milder than previous winters.
- 3.2 Above-ground biomass estimates
  - Overall biomass increased from 1999 to 2002 across treatments, but 2002 biomass lowered relative to 2001 in many plots.
  - Fertilised plots (nitrogen and/or lime) show the strongest productivity; the nitrogen+lime treatment remains the most productive.
  - Control 2 plots generally less productive than Control 1, and productivity declines more on the downslope blocks.
  - Block (slope position) effects: stronger productivity in lower-sloped blocks in some years; slope-related patterns consistent with site gradient.
  - Statistical results: significant treatment effects, year effects, and treatment×year interactions.
- 3.3 Interaction of soil pH, moisture, and above-ground productivity
  - Lime dramatically increases soil pH toward ~7 in the upper soil layer; nitrogen also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (drier, more lime-treated plots tend to be higher pH).
  - Positive overall relationship between higher pH and biomass when all treatments are considered; within some treatments, this relation becomes weaker or reverses (notably when both nitrogen and lime are added).
- 3.4 Point Analysis survey
  - 2002: clear treatment-related differences in frequency of encounters with species; improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) are dominant in fertilised plots; unimproved plots show more Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum hits.
  - Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts) increase across the site; greatest bryophyte involvement in unimproved plots; bryophyte frequency is significantly lower in nitrogen or lime treated plots.
  - Litter hits: 2001–2002 show higher litter hits in fertilised plots; diversity indices (Shannon) rise from baseline but show treatment-dependent changes, with a notable 2002 decline in the nitrogen+lime plots.
  - Functional group dynamics: three main plant functional groups (stress-tolerators S; competitive-stress-ruderals CSR; SR/CSR) accounted for the majority of hits (69–95% per plot). Nitrogen+lime plots show expansion of C-S-R species; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerant species; SR/C-S-R groups decrease with lime and/or insecticide treatments.
  - Multivariate patterns (PCA): lime-treated plots cluster separately; some nitrogen-treated samples resemble limed plots; generally separates improved vs unimproved plots; key species (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, Trifolium repens) associate with fertile conditions, while Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp., Luzula spp. align with poorer conditions.
  - Overall trend: bryophytes increase in proportion, particularly in unimproved plots; vascular plant hits show shifts in community structure driven by fertility and disturbance changes.

## Interpretation and implications (Discussion)

- 4.1 Mowing effect
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline by about 40% since 2000 across all treatments, suggesting a site-level response to mowing rather than a treatment-specific effect.
  - Festuca rubra expands, especially in lime- and nitrogen-rich plots; stress-tolerant species expand across most plots except those receiving nitrogen+lime.
  - Mosses expand with regular mowing and reduced grazing, possibly due to the ~6 cm sward height maintenance and absence of grazing.
- 4.2 Fertilisation effect
  - Long-term productivity gains linked to nitrogen and lime; combined N+L yields the highest productivity, though there is evidence this may be approaching a plateau as pH approaches 7 and soil moisture decreases.
  - High lime rates push pH to near-neutral, potentially reducing productivity in very dry periods; nitrogen addition may contribute to moisture stress under drought conditions.
  - Functional shifts: increased C-S-R dominance in N+L plots suggests plants exploiting the more benign conditions; lime effects appear particularly influential on C-S-R rather than nitrogen alone.
- 4.3 Insecticide effect
  - The insecticide (Dursban) results are not straightforward; while some evidence aligns with increased diversity in certain contexts, definitive links between herbivore suppression and diversity are cautious without more data.
  - Possible mechanism: late-successional, more palatable species may gain under reduced herbivory, while in infertile conditions overall diversity remains comparatively high.
- 4.4 Trampling effect
  - The C2 plots (which experienced trampling during labelled CO2 pulse experiments) show reduced productivity relative to C1 plots, likely due to trampling pressure, especially during intense activity periods.

## Overall takeaways for data-driven GIS work

- The Sourhope dataset links spatially varying treatments (fertility, lime, insecticide) with plant productivity, composition, and functional-type dynamics across a slope gradient.
- Key spatial-differentiating factors include treatment location (which block on the slope), and the distribution of sward height (mowing), moisture, and pH across plots and cells.
- The CSR framework provides a useful lens for modeling functional shifts across space and time in response to management regimes.
- Bryophyte expansion and shifts in vascular plant dominance are detectable via point-analysis spatial surveys and can inform map-based biodiversity indicators.
- Longitudinal data (1999–2002) enable spatial-temporal trend mapping of productivity, species composition, and functional-group distribution under different management scenarios.
