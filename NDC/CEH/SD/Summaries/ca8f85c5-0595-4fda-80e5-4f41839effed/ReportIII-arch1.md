# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The Sourhope field site in the Scottish Borders was used for intensive soil biodiversity monitoring under the NERC programme, with a Baseline Data Survey in 1998 and annual monitoring to aid interpretation across research groups. In 2001, site management faced government FMD restrictions (visitor access February–May) and a change of officer in charge.

## 2. RESULTS

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 weather data were generally unremarkable.
  - Rainfall near the long-term average; radiation similar to prior years.
  - Slightly cooler average temperatures and higher average soil moisture content in 2001 relative to earlier years.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Across treatments, biomass followed a consistent hierarchy, with peak production in July–August each year.
  - 2001 saw a substantial biomass increase compared with previous years, likely due to a change in personnel and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
  - When biomass was normalised to the Control 1 (C1) year-to-year, nitrogen and/or lime treatments showed stronger positive effects on productivity.
  - ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass showed:
    - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L added) vs non-improved plots.
    - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
    - No significant differences between blocks.

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Lime application continued to raise surface soil pH (0–5 cm) by October 2001: ~6.19 in limed plots and ~6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime (N&L) plots.
  - Nitrogen alone also increased pH, though to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed no significant change since August 1998 baseline.

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - July 2001 Point Analysis matched the July 2000 protocol; inter-surveyor differences were not significant.
  - The total number of “hits” in 2001 was about 58% higher than in 2000, suggesting denser sward, possibly due to grazing removal in 1998.
  - Treatment-specific changes (relative abundance by hits):
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments (remaining most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots).
    - Festuca species increased across all treatments; Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina were especially frequent in fertilised plots (P. pratensis in limed and N&L plots).
    - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more Poa pratensis and Poa trivialis; unimproved plots remained more associated with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Diversity notes: unimproved treatments harboured 24 species, while Nitrogen & Lime plots harboured 18, suggesting a possible early trend toward reduced diversity in more fertility-enhanced plots.
  - PCA (point quadrat) generally separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; control plots tended to cluster with bryophytes and low-diversity assemblages.
  - Biomass–species relationships: higher biomass correlated with greater abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; abundances of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass increased.
  - Litter frequency increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## 3. SITE HETEROGENEITY

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) contained more acidic plots, partly reflecting higher proportions of Control or Biocide plots in those columns.
  - Underlying spatial patterns suggested lower pH in Nitrogen and/or Lime plots in these columns.

- 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
  - Several outlier plots with the lowest biomass occurred in various treatments, while higher biomass was typically found in plots more centrally located on the site (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
  - There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No significant difference in biomass between blocks (statistical not significant).
