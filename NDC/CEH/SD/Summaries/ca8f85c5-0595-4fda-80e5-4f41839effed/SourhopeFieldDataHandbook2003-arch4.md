# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- Context: Detailed soil profile data for Rigg Foot at Sourhope, focusing on Block 4, with associated soil analyses, auger samples, vegetation surveys, and connections to Block 5 and Ecotron data. Laboratory identifiers and measured properties are documented to support long-term data governance and cross-site analyses.

## Data Assets Included

- Soil profile descriptions by horizon and depth (Block 4)
- Chemical analyses per horizon (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH in water and CaCl2)
- Soil weight measurements for horizons
- Auger sample analyses (5A–5F) with corresponding soil chemistry and pH data
- Vegetation survey data associated with Block 4 plots and subplots
- Detailed horizon naming and boundary descriptions (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx)
- Site metadata: depth ranges, boundary types, presence of roots, stones, and soil texture descriptors
- Related data for ECOTRON PLOT (Block 4) and Block 5 data for broader context

## Data Structure and Key Variables

- Horizons and depths (Block 4): 
  - LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm)
  - Descriptions include moisture status, root presence, boundary type, and stone content
- Chemical analyses per horizon:
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio
  - Calcium (Ca), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg) in meq/100 g
  - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI)
  - pH in H2O and pH in CaCl2
  - Sample weights (mg)
- Auger samples (4A–4F, later 5A–5F): 
  - %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg
  - %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2)
- Vegetation data (Block 4 and ECOTRON PLOT):
  - Species presence/absence and totals per plot/subplot
  - Indicators of community composition and dominance shifts
- Site and soil context:
  - Bedrock/parent material, soil series, and related metadata
  - Horizon-specific texture and mottling notes
  - Depth-specific soil structure descriptions (block-level and horizon-level)

## Sampling Design and Methods

- Block-based site layout:
  - Block 4 with multiple horizons sampled from topsoil to subsoil (0–95 cm range)
  - Block 5 data available for broader context (0–100 cm horizons)
- Sampling approach:
  - Descriptive soil profiles with horizon-level sampling
  - Laboratory analyses conducted on horizon samples (N, C, LOI, pH, exchangeable cations)
  - Auger sampling to capture surface and subsurface variation (5A–5F, etc.)
- Vegetation surveys:
  - Plot and subplot level vegetation presence/absence data collected
  - Species totals and indicator species identified where detectable
- Data provenance:
  - Each horizon and sample linked to MLURI/CEH identifiers and barcodes
  - Clear delineation of depth intervals, boundary types, and boundary sharpness

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Observations

- Data quality notes:
  - Comprehensive horizon-level chemistry and pH measurements are provided for Block 4 and Block 5 horizons
  - Auger samples provide additional chemical profiles, enabling cross-depth comparisons
- Limitations and gaps:
  - Some Na data are missing or not reported for certain horizons
  - Vegetation data is patchy in places (subset of plots/subplots sampled), limiting full-plot representativeness
  - Block-to-block variability observed; profiles show heterogeneity across depth and horizon, affecting broad generalizations
- Data consistency:
  - Units and methods appear consistent within the block; cross-block metadata and documentation support comparability

## Data Governance, Access, and Use

- Data provenance and archiving:
  - Horizon and sample data are accompanied by MLURI barcodes and Wt (mg) measurements
  - Archival data support long-term storage and potential re-analysis
- Metadata and documentation:
  - Detailed horizon descriptions, boundary types, and soil-chemistry tables accompany the profiles
  - Appendices and supplementary tables provide granular backing data
- Re-use potential:
  - Enables cross-domain analyses linking soil chemistry, texture, and depth with vegetation patterns
  - Supports longitudinal and cross-site comparisons within Sourhope and with broader ECN/Micronet networks

## Practical Takeaways for Data Leaders

- Multi-modal data integration:
  - Combines horizon-level soil chemistry, physical descriptions, auger sampling, and vegetation surveys into a cohesive data asset
- Robust experimental context:
  - Clear horizon naming, depth intervals, and boundary descriptors facilitate reproducibility and cross-site comparison
- Data quality management:
  - Recognize data gaps (e.g., missing Na values, incomplete vegetation coverage) and plan targeted follow-up sampling and standardized metadata
- Governance and accessibility:
  - Use of unique barcodes and centralized archival storage supports traceability, provenance, and collaboration with partner networks
- Actionable implications:
  - The dataset supports soil-vegetation interaction analyses, soil fertility and acidity assessments, and long-term monitoring within a standardized, well-documented framework
