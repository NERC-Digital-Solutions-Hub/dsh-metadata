# SUMMARY

- Context and programme aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on linking above-ground plant responses with soil biodiversity and related processes at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - The project combines multiple sub-projects to study soil biota, soil processes, and feedbacks to vascular plant communities.

- Experimental design and data-collection framework
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots with 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells.
  - Treatments (plot-level and site-level)
    - Plot-level: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4).
    - Site-level: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept).
  - Data collection starting 1998–1999, with ongoing data streams across 1999–2002:
    - Plant productivity: above-ground biomass harvested from random 0.5 m2 cells, processed after mowing.
    - Botanical surveys: baseline (1998) and annual 0.5 m2 point analyses (2000–2002) using 100-hole grid with 25-pin-positions; bryophytes identified to species in 2002; detailed Appendix 3 species lists.
    - Soil measurements: soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe, measured July/August 2002); baseline pH in 1998.
    - Weather data: on-site Automatic Weather Station (1999–2002) including rainfall, radiation, and temperature metrics.
    - Additional small-scale surveys: vegetation cover, biomass sorting by species, and various project-specific sampling efforts (Appendices 3–8).

- Key data totals and sources
  - 11,621 soil samples to date; 11621 samples collected since project start.
  - 2002 field activities included major project-fieldwork by Phase II teams and CO2-trace gas flux studies with CEH mobile labs.
  - Weather data 1999–2002 (with 2002 gaps due to a station malfunction later substituted from Konza data).
  - Appendices compile: annual biomass by plot (Appendix 6), rank analyses (Appendix 7), and species/bryophyte lists (Appendix 3).

- Major findings (data-driven signals)
  - Fertilisation effects on productivity
    - Nitrogen and/or lime increase above-ground biomass; plots with both nitrogen and lime show the strongest productivity gains.
    - Fertilised plots may approach or reach a plateau, potentially due to high soil pH and reduced soil moisture; productivity may decline if pH rises further or moisture declines.
    - The slope of the site influences productivity, with lower gains on steeper/slightly drier blocks.
  - Mowing effects on community structure
    - Consistent decline of Agrostis spp. (capillaris and vinealis) since 2000, across all treatments, suggesting a site-level response to mowing vs. grazing.
    - Festuca rubra expands, particularly in nutrient-enriched plots, aligning with shifts toward more fertile conditions.
    - Regular mowing and lack of grazing promote bryophyte expansion (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus), linked to a ~6 cm sward height.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity
    - Highest plant diversity observed in insecticide-treated plots in some metrics; evidence is circumstantial regarding direct causation (reduced herbivory may allow palatable species to persist).
    - Diversity patterns align with considerations from historical insect-plant studies, but attribution to the insecticide is not definitive.
  - Trampling effects
    - In the C2 plots, 2002 productivity fell sharply, likely due to trampling during intense activity (e.g., 13CO2 pulses), rather than treatment effects alone.
  - Functional group shifts and diversity metrics
    - CSR framework: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress (C-S-R), and stress-ruderal (SR/C-S-R) groups dominate; N&L plots favor CSR expansion, unimproved plots favor S.
    - 2002 Point Analysis shows increasing bryophyte frequency in unimproved plots; fertilised plots show reduced bryophyte hits, with shifts in dominant vascular species (e.g., Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in fertile plots).
    - Shannon diversity declined in N&L plots from baseline, while insecticide plots showed notable diversity increases; overall, diversity responds to treatment mix and disturbance regime.
  - Relationship among soil properties and productivity
    - Lime raises soil pH toward ~7.0 in upper soil layers; soil moisture is negatively correlated with pH.
    - Across all plots, higher pH generally correlates with higher biomass, though this relationship weakens or reverses within certain treatment combinations (e.g., N+L).
  - Bryophyte dynamics
    - Bryophyte hits increased overall across years, especially in unimproved plots, contributing to shifts in biomass composition.
    - Bryophyte dynamics interact with underlying plant community structure and nutrient status.

- Data quality, limitations, and considerations for interpretation
  - 2002 weather-data gaps due to a station malfunction; some data replaced from Konza station data during missing periods.
  - Fieldwork intensity and access constraints (e.g., post-foot-and-mouth restrictions in 2001) affected data collection cadence.
  - The causal links between specific management actions (e.g., insecticide) and diversity metrics remain interpretive without further targeted experiments.

- Implications for data management and governance (Data Leaders perspective)
  - Demonstrates the value of long-term, multi-variable field datasets to diagnose system-level responses and trade-offs between productivity and biodiversity.
  - Highlights the need for robust metadata, standardized measurement protocols, and transparent data provenance to enable cross-year analyses (e.g., biomass, point analyses, soil chemistry, and bryophyte data).
  - Emphasizes coordinated data across plots, treatments, blocks, and time to support cross-functional analyses and community-scale inferences.

- Accessibility and further resources
  - Primary data are organized in appendices (Appendix 2–8) and project reports; species lists and survey results are documented in Appendix 3 and related appendices.
  - Detailed methodologies and treatment summaries are available from project PIs and via the Soil Biodiversity programme materials.
