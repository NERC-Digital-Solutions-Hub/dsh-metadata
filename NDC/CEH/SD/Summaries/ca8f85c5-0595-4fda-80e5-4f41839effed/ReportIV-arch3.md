# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Overview
  - Four-year monitoring of a large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) within the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Focus on changes in above-ground productivity (biomass), plant species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) in response to management treatments.
  - Five treatments established: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, plus an Insecticide treatment. All plots mowed regularly; nitrogen and/or lime applied in spring; insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) applied after mowing on insecticide plots.
  - Major findings relate to three management processes: mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide use; trampling during 13CO2 pulses also affected some plots.

- Experimental Design and Data Collection
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots randomized, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m2 sampling cells used for data collection.
  - Site management: annual mowing to approximately 6 cm; insecticide applied post-mowing; nitrogen and/or lime added to designated plots in spring.
  - Data collected:
    - Weather: continuous data from an on-site Automatic Weather Station since Feb 1999.
    - Above-ground productivity: annual clipping of a random 0.5 m2 cell per sub-plot; samples dried and weighed.
    - Botanical surveys: baseline survey in 1998; subsequent fixed-area point analyses (July/August) in 2000, 2001, 2002 using a 0.5 m2 cell with a 100-point grid and 25-pin drops; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
    - Soil chemistry and moisture: soil pH measured at ~5 cm depth since 1998; soil moisture measured with a theta probe in 2002; additional soil sampling and micro-surveys conducted.
    - Data volume: field sampling and site activity through 2002 totaled over 11,600 soil samples collected since start.
  - Data governance and metadata: detailed appendices describe site layout, treatments, species lists, weather data, biomass measurements, and point-analysis results.

- Treatments and Site Activity
  - Site-level and plot-level management tasks (since 1999):
    - Regular mowing across the whole site (approx. 6 cm).
    - Insecticide application on insecticide plots after mowing.
    - Fertility treatments: Nitrogen and Lime applied to designated plots (two-year schedule with year-specific timing).
  - Data collection activities:
    - 1999–2002 weather data; 1999–2002 biomass sampling; baseline 1998 vegetation survey.
    - 2000–2002 repeated point analyses to track species composition; bryophytes recorded more comprehensively in 2002.
    - Soil pH and moisture measurements across treatments and sampling times.
  - Notable field events:
    - Research activity resumed post foot-and-mouth restrictions in 2002.
    - 2002 saw the introduction of new sampling on Control 2 plots and the use of labelled 13CO2 pulses by some projects; a weather-station malfunction caused data losses for part of 2002.

- Key Findings by Theme

  - Mowing effect
    - Reduction in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across most plots (approx. 40% decline since 2000).
    - Festuca rubra expanded, especially in lime- and nitrogen-fertilised plots.
    - Bryophytes expanded broadly, aided by a consistent sward height (~6 cm) and lack of grazing.
    - Stress-tolerant (S) species increased across treatments; ruderal SR/C-S-R groups declined with increased disturbance removal.
    - Overall, mowing and reduced disturbance favored mosses and stress-tolerant taxa, with fertility modulating how strongly these shifts occurred.

  - Fertilisation effect
    - Productivity (above-ground biomass) increased with nitrogen and/or lime; plots receiving both (N+L) showed the strongest biomass accumulation.
    - Lime raised mean soil pH toward 7.0 in upper soil, with nitrogen having a smaller positive effect on pH.
    - A positive pH–biomass relationship overall, but the relationship varied by treatment; in plots with both N and lime, biomass–pH trends differed, suggesting moisture limitations or chlorosis under high pH.
    - Higher pH and fertility favored competitive, growth-rich functional types (C-S-R) while stress-tolerators benefited more in unfertilised plots.

  - Insecticide effect
    - Dursban 4 OPA treatment’s impact on diversity is unclear; evidence suggests possible indirect effects via herbivore suppression that could benefit certain palatable species, but a direct causal link to Shannon diversity is not established.
    - Results align with literature showing insect herbivory can shape diversity in complex, context-dependent ways.

  - Trampling effect
    - The C2 plots showed markedly reduced productivity in 2002, attributed to trampling during intensive sampling linked to 13CO2 pulse experiments rather than a treatment effect.

- Biodiversity, Community Structure, and Functional Groups

  - Species composition and abundance
    - Shifts toward Festuca rubra and other fertile-condition grasses in fertilised plots; unimproved plots maintained higher relative abundance of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
    - Bryophyte hits rose across treatments, notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, increasing bryophyte share of total hits (up to ~20% in 2002).
  - Diversity metrics
    - Shannon diversity indices showed treatment-specific responses: declines in nitrogen + lime plots (~15% below baseline by 2002) and increases in several other treatments (range roughly 2–29% depending on treatment).
  - Functional groups (CSR framework)
    - Three predominant functional groups (S, C-S-R, SR/C-S-R) dominated the plots across years, representing 69–95% of vascular plant hits in 2000–2002.
    - In N+L plots, C-S-R species became more dominant; stress-tolerant (S) and SR/C-S-R groups rose in unimproved plots.
    - By 2002, significant differences among treatments emerged for all three groups, with C-S-R and SR/C-S-R favored in fertilised/fertility-enhanced plots and S favored in unimproved plots.
  - Multivariate patterns
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the 2002 point-analysis data separated improved (fertilised/limed) plots from unimproved plots; lime-treated plots formed a distinct group.
    - Within the species-level data, certain grasses (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra) associated with higher fertility distinguished improved plots from unimproved.

- Data Quality, Gaps, and Governance Considerations for Monitoring Frameworks
  - Data richness and longevity: multi-year, multi-treatment design with replicated blocks enables robust trend detection for biomass, diversity, and functional group shifts.
  - Metadata and standardization: explicit, well-documented measurement protocols (e.g., mowing to 6 cm, 0.5 m2 clipping, 100-point point analysis) and detailed appendices (site map, species lists, treatment summaries) support reproducibility and cross-site comparability.
  - Data gaps and reliability: 2002 weather data losses due to station malfunction; incomplete Control 2 data for 2000–2001; some trampling-related data issues in C2 plots. These highlight the need for robust data backup, redundancy, and clear data-quality flags.
  - Data accessibility and governance: the study demonstrates the value of sharing site-level metadata, treatment regimes, and species lists; ensuring openness of underlying data while safeguarding sensitive information remains a key governance issue.
  - Implications for monitoring design
    - Long-term, multi-factor experiments are powerful for detecting interaction effects between management actions and soil-plant dynamics.
    - Incorporating functional trait frameworks (like CSR) aids interpretation of community responses to nutrient status, disturbance regime, and soil chemistry.
    - Systematic, repeatable sampling protocols and comprehensive metadata are essential for data reuse and cross-study synthesis.

- Conclusion
  - The Sourhope site provides a comprehensive demonstration of how mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide use, in combination with soil chemistry and moisture dynamics, drive pronounced changes in productivity, species composition, bryophyte prevalence, and functional-group structure over time.
  - The monitoring framework effectively captures longitudinal ecological responses, but success hinges on consistent data collection, rigorous metadata, and robust data governance to address gaps and enable broader data sharing and reuse.
