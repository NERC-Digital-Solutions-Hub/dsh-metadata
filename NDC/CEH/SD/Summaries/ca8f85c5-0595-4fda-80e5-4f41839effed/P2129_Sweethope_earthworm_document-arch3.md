# Earthworm diversity and the integration of physical, biochemical and microbiological functions. Professor D W Hopkins

- Context and aims
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (established 1999) focusing on linking soil biodiversity with functional ecological processes.
  - Sourhope/Sweethope field setup used to study interactions between earthworms, soil microbial processes, organic matter transformations, and physical soil structure.
  - 24 projects funded within the programme; emphasis on biodiversity, soil processes, and functional roles of soil biota.

- Study design: Sweethope mesocosm experiment
  - Main Sourhope plots were isolated from the Sweethope site to prevent contamination during earthworm inoculation.
  - 100 soil boxes (approx. 8 t) buried at Sweethope; half the soil hand-sorted to remove earthworms for control comparisons.
  - Earthworm inoculation targeted representative functional groups present on site:
    - Epigeic: Lumbricus rubellus (20 individuals/box)
    - Endogeic: Allolobophora chlorotica (15 individuals/box)
    - Anecic: Lumbricus terrestris (4 individuals/box)
  - Treatments
    - No earthworm inoculation
    - One epigeic species (A)
    - One endogeic species (B)
    - One anecic species (C)
    - All three groups (ABC)
  - Lime treatment mirrored on main Sourhope plots; boxes were designed to be earthworm-proof with fine mesh lids and drainage holes; grass was cut regularly to maintain lid integrity.

- Data collection and structure
  - Two primary datasets collected at the end of the Sweethope mesocosm experiment (October 2001):
    - Dataset 1009: Sweethope Endpoint Botanical Composition Data
      - Fields: SAMPLE_ID, SAMPLING_DATE, BLOCK, MAIN_PLOT, SUB_PLOT, CELL_X, CELL_Y, TREATMENT (C=Control, L=Limed), SPECIES, BOTANICAL_COMPOSITION (Braun-Blanquet scale 0–6)
      - Purpose: record plant species presence and cover in each treatment plot at experiment end.
    - Dataset 1010: Sweethope Endpoint Earthworm Survey Data
      - Fields: SAMPLE_ID, SAMPLING_DATE, BLOCK, MAIN_PLOT, SUB_PLOT, CELL_X, CELL_Y, TREATMENT (C/L), SPECIES, ABUNDANCE (total per m2), BIOMASS (per m2)
      - Purpose: census earthworm abundance and biomass by species per unit area.
  - Methods
    - Earthworm census via hand-sorting (preferred over chemical extraction to avoid plot contamination).
    - Specimens preserved in 40% ethanol, identified to species using Sims & Gerard (1985) keys.
    - Abundance and biomass calculated per square metre of soil.

- Site and sample details
  - Location: Sourhope upland grassland, southern Scottish Borders; main site with Brown Forest Soils; steep north-facing slope.
  - Enclosure: 100 m west of main plots; designed to minimize cross-contamination during inoculation.
  - Sampling timing: botanical data collected 16–17 October 2001; earthworm census conducted concurrently with end of experiment.

- Data quality, access, and governance
  - Quality control: numeric range checks, format conformity, and logical integrity checks.
  - Data stewardship: datasets subject to QA procedures; NERC disclaims warranty of accuracy and does not assume liability for data use or outcomes.
  - Metadata and sharing: dataset structures and documentation provided; data sharing and governance considerations noted (barriers and responsibilities highlighted in related programme documentation).
