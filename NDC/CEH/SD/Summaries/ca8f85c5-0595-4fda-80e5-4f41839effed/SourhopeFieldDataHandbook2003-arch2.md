  - Part of a standardized soil-vegetation monitoring approach, with QA/archiving practices aligned to the Sourhope ECN framework.
  - Data intended for storage, sharing, and reuse within national monitoring networks.

- Practical implications
  - Provides a baseline for nutrient status and organic matter content in upland soils under hill grazing.
  - Supports interpretation of vegetation responses to soil chemistry and management practices (e.g., liming, N inputs) within Block 4’s experimental context.

# BLOCK 5: SOIL AND VEGETATION DATA (RIGG FOOT, SOURHOPE)

- Site context (Block 5)
  - Grid reference: NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; soil drainage: imperfect.
  - Major soil: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous/andesite.

- Soil profile observations (Block 5)
  - Profiles across horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg (depths roughly 0–100 cm)
  - Selected horizon characteristics:
    - Ah/A horizon: very dark colours; sandy silt loam with substantial roots; higher C and N contents near the surface.
    - FH/H: high humus content; elevated %C and %N in surface horizons; greater LOI and moisture loss in upper horizons.
    - AB/Bg/BCg: transition to clay loams with mottling; lower C and N relative to Ah/H; persistent acidity.
    - Cg: clay-rich horizon with lower nutrient levels but notable Ca and Mg in some blocks.
  - Chemical highlights (selected blocks/horizons):
    - %N: variable, ranging from near-zero in some deeper horizons to above 2% in surface horizons.
    - %C: highest in FH/Upper horizons (up to ~33–34% in FH; ~31% in H) and lower in subsoils.
    - C:N: commonly 10–16 across horizons.
    - Ca: generally high in surface horizons (e.g., up to ~11.9 meq/100 g in FH) and variable in deeper horizons.
    - pH: generally acidic; pH(H2O) roughly 4.3–5.2; pHCaCl2 roughly 3.5–4.5.
    - %Moisture loss and %LOI: high in surface horizons (LOI up to ~67% in FH), decreasing with depth.
  - Horizon structure and textures are consistent with Brown forest soils with gleying, showing clear horizon differentiation and block-to-block variability.

- Soil auger analyses (Block 5)
  - Sample set: 5A–5F (auger analyses) and related analyses
  - Observed ranges (illustrative):
    - %N: ~0.53–0.62
    - %C: ~6.99–9.07
    - C:N: ~12.94–14.74
    - Ca: ~2.58–5.07 meq/100 g
    - Mg: ~1.51–2.89 meq/100 g
    - K: ~0.59–0.83 meq/100 g
    - Na: ~0.14–0.17 meq/100 g
    - %Moisture loss: ~4.60–5.19
    - %LOI: ~4.83–20.10
    - pH(H2O): ~4.70–4.95
    - pH CaCl2: ~3.53–4.14
  - Notable variability across subplots, with higher LOI and Ca in some samples and pronounced acidity in CaCl2 measurements.

- Vegetation survey (Block 5)
  - Subplots 5A–5F show species totals and presence across multiple species groups (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc, etc.).
  - Species richness varies by subplot, with some plots showing relatively high totals (e.g., totals over 40–50 species in some subplots) and others showing lower richness, reflecting microtopography and management history.

- ECOTRON soil site and vegetation (ECOTRON PLOT)
  - Soil: Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76; Na 0.15; K 0.62; Mg 1.7; %Moisture loss 4.79; %LOI 17.42; pH H2O 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82.
  - Vegetation: Subplots show varying counts of taxa across Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, P, with presence/absence and totals indicating moderate to high species richness and a mix of grasses and forbs.

- Data management and network context
  - Sourhope is an ECN site contributing to long-term soil, air, water quality and biodiversity monitoring.
  - Hosted within SERAD Micronet (1998–2002) to explore relationships among soil microbes, plant communities, and nutrient status.
  - Data are quality assured, archived (including -80°C sample storage), and linked to MLURI/CEH platforms for long-term access and reuse.

- Enduring value and challenges (analyst perspective)
  - Value: multi-layered, long-term data linking vegetation composition, soil chemistry, horizon development, and management treatments within a hill grazing system.
  - Challenges and aims:
    - Integrate Block 4–5 Sourhope data with climate, hydrology, biodiversity, and historical management data to broaden analyses and cross-site comparability.
    - Improve access to underlying raw data, metadata, and treatment histories to support policy scrutiny and data-driven decision-making.

- Practical applications
  - Establishes baseline reference conditions for upland grasslands under varied nutrient regimes and disturbance.
  - Provides standardized methods and datasets to monitor soil-vegetation interactions, nutrient cycling, and carbon dynamics under lime, nitrogen, biocide treatments, and grazing management.
