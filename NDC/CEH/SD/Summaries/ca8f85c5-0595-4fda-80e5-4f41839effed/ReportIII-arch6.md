# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide a broad data context to support detailed studies: weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition.
- 1999–2001; site management affected by Foot and Mouth restrictions in 2001 and a change of site officer mid-2001.
- Data are organized to facilitate cross-year comparisons and links to other research groups (e.g., through tables and figures paralleling Report II).

## Data collection and methods
- Measurements and dates: referenced Table 1; monitoring across weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical surveys.
- Above-ground biomass
  - Sampling: five mowing occasions per summer (May–September); random 0.5 m2 cells in sub-plots S, T, U, V within each plot.
  - Processing: clippings dried at 80°C; weights summed to yield annual biomass; ln-transformed for ANOVA.
- Botanical composition
  - July 2001 point quadrat survey: 100 x 5 cm cells; large pins dropped to record species hits.
  - Two surveyors covered roughly half of quadrats each; reproducibility checked.
  - Species abundance tracked as “hits” per treatment; PCA used to explore community shifts.
- Soil pH
  - Upper 5 cm soil sampled; October 2001 pH measurements; baseline pH from August 1998 for comparison.
- Weather data
  - Automatic Weather Station on site; daily measures (rainfall, radiation, temperature); data downloaded and transmitted to CEH’s data manager.
- Treatments and site events
  - Treatments include Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide; applied 1998–2001.
  - 2001: FMD restrictions limited site access; one management change (Officer in Charge) in May 2001.
- Data analysis
  - ANOVA (Genstat 5) on ln-transformed biomass; inter-year analyses; PCA for botanical data.
  - Significance testing for treatment effects, year effects, and their interactions.

## Key results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline measures near long-term averages.
- Rainfall: ~839 mm (lower than 1999–2000 peaks but close to average).
- Radiation: ~3473 MJ m-2; little change year-to-year.
- Temperature: average air/soil temperatures slightly lower than prior years.
- Soil moisture: generally higher than previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear, consistent biomass hierarchy by treatment; peak biomass typically in July/August.
- 2001 biomass substantially higher than earlier years, attributed to staffing changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Normalising biomass to the C1 (control) treatment showed:
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime additions significantly boost biomass versus unimproved plots.
  - Nitrogen & Lime combination often most effective.
- ANOVA on log biomass:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) versus non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition raises soil pH in the top 5 cm:
  - Limed plots: ~6.19
  - Nitrogen & Lime plots: ~6.38
- Nitrogen alone also raises pH, but less than lime.
- Control plots show little pH change since baseline (1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 sampling: total hits 58% higher than July 2000, indicating denser sward; no significant surveyor difference.
- Treatment effects on species
  - Agrostis capillaris (dominant in 2000) declined across all treatments in 2001; remained dominant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. increased across treatments, especially in Nitrogen and Nitrogen+Lime plots.
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) more prominent in fertilised plots (notably N and N&L).
  - Species associated with less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
- Diversity
  - 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting a trend toward reduced diversity in more productive plots.
- Community structure
  - Principal Components Analysis generally separates nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from controls/biocide.
  - Biomass correlates positively with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis; correlations decline for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes as biomass increases.
  - Litter frequency increases in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetative turnover with increased fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity across the site observed; columns E and F (right-hand slope) show more acidic plots, influenced partly by higher proportions of unimproved plots in those columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Some outlier plots show very low biomass across treatments; central plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime in 2E; Lime in 2C; Biocide in 2D; Control 1 in 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks overall.

## Data quality and management

- Reproducibility check for botanical survey:
  - No significant difference between the two surveyors (p = 0.18).
- Data integration and provenance:
  - Weather data managed by site team and CEH data manager.
  - Biomass, pH, and botanical data aligned with plot-level treatments and year.
- Documentation and schedules:
  - Detailed measurement schedules and measurement protocols provided (Table 1 and accompanying appendix materials).

## Data products and recommendations

- Potential data products for end users
  - Time-series dashboards of biomass by treatment and year (1999–2001).
  - pH maps and biomass maps across the site to illustrate heterogeneity.
  - Scatter plots of biomass vs. surface pH by treatment; probability distributions of biomass per year.
  - PCA biplots and species-abundance heatmaps to show community shifts by treatment.
  - Correlation analyses linking dominant species abundance to biomass and fertility indicators.
- Data management notes
  - Maintain cross-year comparability by continuing consistent mowing and sampling protocols.
  - Preserve multi-operator data quality checks for botanical surveys.
  - Ensure clear linkage between site management events (e.g., FMD restrictions) and data interpretation.

Appendix highlights
