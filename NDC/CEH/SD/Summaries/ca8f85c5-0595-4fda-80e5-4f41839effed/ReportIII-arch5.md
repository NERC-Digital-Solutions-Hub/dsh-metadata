# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction (summary)
- Large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Purpose: provide context for groups’ datasets, enable cross-year comparisons, and link site-level measurements with detailed studies.
- Site management included in Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998). Two 2001 events affected management: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change of Officer in Charge.
- Data and measurements were planned to facilitate comparisons across years and treatments, with explicit data collection dates and protocols.

## Data types, measurements, and methods
- Measurements and data types:
  - Automatic Weather Station (site rainfall, temperature, radiation, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground biomass (seasonal harvests across May–September; plots in multiple sub-plots; dry mass).
  - Soil pH (upper 5 cm).
  - Botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001 matched July 2000 protocol; 100 5 cm cells per quadrat; 25 pins per cell).
- Experimental design and treatments:
  - Five treatments across plots: Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide.
  - Split-plot design with multiple blocks; annual biomass data aggregated per plot.
  - Data processing: biomass values were ln-transformed for ANOVA; Results normalized against a control (C1) for year-by-year comparisons.
- Data collection schedule and provenance:
  - Table 1 (data collection dates for key measurements) and Table 3 (1999–2001 weather data) illustrate measurement cadence.
  - Data management: Automatic Weather Station data downloaded regularly and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager; weather data shared with CEH Merlewood.
  - Appendix 1 provides annualised above-ground biomass per plot.

## Key results (sections 2.1–2.4)

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average; radiation stable; slight drop in average temperature; soil moisture modestly higher than prior year.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak biomass in July/August.
  - 2001 biomass markedly higher than 2000, attributed to staff changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass normalized to C1 to assess true treatment effects; significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effect.

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Lime additions continued to raise soil pH (upper 5 cm):
    - Limed plots: average pH 6.19 (Oct 2001).
    - Nitrogen & Lime plots: average pH 6.38.
  - Nitrogen alone raised pH modestly; Control plots remained largely unchanged since Aug 1998 baseline.

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - July 2001 protocol replicated from 2000; no significant inter-surveyor differences.
  - 58% more total hits in 2001 than 2000 across treatments, suggesting increased sward density (potentially due to reduced grazing since 1998).
  - Species-level changes by treatment:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, except still dominant in Control1 and Limed plots.
    - Festuca spp. increased across treatments; particularly F. ovina in N, and F. rubra in N & L plots.
    - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis); less-diverse communities observed in the most improved plots (24 species in unimproved vs 18 in N+L plots).
  - Multivariate analysis (PCA) generally separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots associated with bryophytes and Nardus stricta; improved plots showed more Festuca rubra and related species.
  - Biomass vs species composition correlations:
    - Positive correlation between Festuca rubra / Poa pratensis abundance and biomass.
    - Declines in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with increasing biomass.
  - Litter frequency increased in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity (section 3)

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Spatial heterogeneity across the site observed; columns E and F tended to have more acidic plots, linked to a higher proportion of Control/Biocide plots in those columns.
  - Suggests underlying spatial structure influencing pH and community composition.

- 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
  - Biomass readings show outliers with the lowest biomass in several plots; central-location plots often yielded higher biomass (e.g., N+L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
  - Positive correlation between surface pH and biomass.
  - No significant difference in biomass between blocks, indicating block-level spatial effects were not driving major differences.

## Management events and data quality considerations
- 2001 Foot and Mouth restrictions limited site access Feb–May; work proceeded under an agreed protocol during restricted period.
- Change of Officer in Charge mid-2001; potential impacts on data collection continuity and site management.
- 2001 shift from manual mowing to mechanical shears likely influenced biomass measurements; important for longitudinal comparisons and metadata documentation.
- One biocide application in May 2001 was missed.
- Survey methods showed high consistency across surveyors in 2001; protocol replication with PCA and ANOVA supports cross-year comparability, but method changes and management disruptions should be captured in metadata.

## Data availability and governance implications for Data Stewards
- Data types and governance:
  - Weather data centralized and shared with external data managers; weather-related data are a stable, shared resource.
  - Plant and soil data (biomass, pH, botanical surveys) are plot-level with clear treatment, block, and spatial structure; metadata should document plot layout, column coordinates, and treatment assignments.
  - Historical baseline and year-by-year data (1998–2001) support longitudinal analyses but require careful documentation of methodological changes.
- Metadata and provenance:
  - Capture measurement methods, mowing protocols, and the exact date ranges for biomass harvesting and soil sampling.
  - Document changes in personnel, equipment (manual vs mechanical cutters), and any deviations from planned management (e.g., missed biocide application).
  - Record site heterogeneity context (plot positions, column layout, block structure) to support spatial analyses.
- Data processing and reproducibility:
  - Note data normalization to C1 and ln-transformations used in analyses; include statistical methods (ANOVA, PCA) and the specific year-by-treatment interactions observed.
  - Provide Appendix data (Appendix 1) and figures as reference for downstream analyses.
- Data quality considerations:
  - Inter-surveyor agreement appears robust for point quadrat data in 2001; document any remaining uncertainties.
  - Be mindful of potential biases introduced by changes in cutting method and management disruptions when comparing 1999–2001 results.
- Practical reuse implications:
  - Cross-year comparisons are feasible but require attention to protocol changes and site management events.
  - The dataset supports analyses of treatment effects on biomass and soil chemistry, as well as species-level responses to fertility treatment and liming, within a heterogeneous field site.

## Summary of core takeaways for Data Stewards
- The Sourhope field experiment provides a multi-year, treatment-structured dataset combining weather, biomass, soil pH, and plant community data, with explicit measurement schedules and robust metadata potential.
- 2001 saw notable changes: increased biomass due to methodological and staffing changes, soil pH shifts due to lime and nitrogen, and shifts in plant community composition toward species associated with improved pastures.
- Site heterogeneity is an important contextual factor; metadata should capture spatial layout, column-based variation, and block effects to support proper analysis.
- Data governance should emphasize meticulous metadata for methods, protocols, and management events, enabling reproducibility and accurate cross-year comparisons.
