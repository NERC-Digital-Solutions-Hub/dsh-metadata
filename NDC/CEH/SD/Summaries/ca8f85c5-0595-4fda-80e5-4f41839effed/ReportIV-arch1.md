Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report 2002

## Overview
- Four-year field experiment at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders) studying soil biodiversity and above-ground plant responses.
- Focus on productivity (above-ground biomass), species composition, and diversity across treatments.
- Experimental design: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block with 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m2 sampling cells used for data collection.
- Five site-wide and plot-level management tasks since 1999, including mowing, insecticide application, and fertilisation (nitrogen and lime) with combinations thereof.

## Treatments and Principal Effects
- Mowing (regular cuts to ~6 cm): major driver of botanical change.
  - Promotes Festuca spp. (Festuca rubra) and suppresses Agrostis spp.; bryophyte (mosses) expansion likely due to sward height and reduced disturbance.
  - Decline in two Agrostis species observed across all treatments since 2000; site-level mowing likely a key factor beyond specific treatments.
- Fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime):
  - Clear, consistent increases in above-ground productivity in fertilised plots; greatest gains when nitrogen and lime are combined.
  - Lime raises soil pH toward ~7.0; high lime rates linked to potential moisture stress and chlorosis in some vegetation; productivity may peak and then decline in highly limed plots.
  - Functional shifts: nitrogen and lime together favor competitive, C-S-R plant types; unfertilised plots favor stress-tolerators (S).
- Insecticide (Dursban 4, applied post-mow in insecticide plots):
  - Diversity (Shannon index) highest in insecticide plots; mechanism linking reduced herbivory to diversity is not definitively established, though patterns align with some literature on herbivore–plant diversity interactions.
  - Caveat: evidence is circumstantial; exact insect control levels not fully quantified in all plots.
- Trampling (noted in C2 plots during 13CO2 pulses):
  - Dramatic drop in productivity in C2 plots likely due to trampling during labeled CO2 pulse experiments rather than a chronic treatment effect.

## Data Collection and Methods
- Site design: 5 blocks on a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m2 sampling cells across sub-plots S, T, U, V.
- Treatments:
  - Control 1: No treatment
  - Control 2: No treatment
  - Nitrogen
  - Lime
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA)
- Data types:
  - Weather: on-site Automatic Weather Station (precipitation, temperature, radiation, soil moisture)
  - Biomass: regular clipping of 0.5 m2 cells, dried and weighed
  - Vegetation surveys: baseline and annual point analysis (0.5 m2 cell with 100-point grid; 25-grid pin; bryophyte separation enhanced in 2002)
  - Soil: pH (5 cm depth), soil moisture (theta probe)
  - Species lists and detailed Appendix data (vascular plants and bryophytes)
  - Data analysis: ANOVA (split-plot), PCA, and other statistical summaries; biomass expressed relative to controls; CSR functional-type classification (stress tolerators, competitors, ruderals)
- Timeline: data collected annually from 1999–2002; some 2002 data gaps due to weather-station malfunction (missing July–Nov data; substituted with Konza station data for affected measures).

## Results Snapshot
- Biomass productivity
  - 2002: overall biomass lower than 2001 across most treatments, but long-term trend shows biomass increasing from 1999 baseline.
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L) plots remained the most productive; Control 2 plots among the least productive.
  - Block-level gradient effects: Block 5 showed larger declines (16%), while Block 1 showed up to 30% decline in biomass; indicates slope position influences measured productivity.
- Soil chemistry and productivity
  - Lime application substantially increased soil pH to near 7.0 in upper soil layers; nitrogen also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
  - There is a strong negative relationship between soil moisture and soil pH (r ≈ -0.68); improved plots (higher pH) tended to be drier.
  - Positive overall association between higher soil pH and biomass across all plots, though this relationship weakens within N-only or Lime-only plots and becomes negative in plots with both N and Lime.
- Plant functional groups and community structure
  - Point Analysis surveys show improved (fertilised) plots dominated by Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots dominated by Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Bryophyte abundance (mosses) increased across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; overall bryophyte hits rose from 10.8% (2001) to 19.9% (2002).
  - Shannon Diversity Index: 2002 values fell by 15% in N&L plots relative to baseline, while other treatments showed increases (2–29% range).
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) shows clear separation between improved (lime/N and lime) and unimproved plots; some nitrogen-treated samples cluster with limed plots.
- Species abundance shifts (point analysis)
  - Two common improved-pasture grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) are disproportionately represented in fertilised plots.
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline; Festuca ovina declines; Festuca rubra increases, indicating a shift toward more fertile conditions.
  - Bryophytes (notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) more abundant in numerous plots; bryophyte dominance increases correlate with lower vascular plant Monocots/Dicots balance in unimproved plots.
  - Functional groups (S, CSR, SR/CSR) show shifts: C-S-R species expand in N&L plots; S (stress-tolerators) expand in unimproved plots; SR/CSR reduced in lime and inoc insecticide plots.
- Insecticide effects on diversity
  - Diversity indices often higher in insecticide plots, but direct causal links to insect control remain uncertain; potential mechanism may involve allowing more palatable, diverse species to persist in a comparatively infertile environment.

## Discussion: Interpretations and Patterns
- Mowing effect
  - Removing grazing disturbance plus regular mowing favors stress-tolerant and moss-dominated communities; reduced disturbance likely facilitates Festuca rubra expansion in fertile plots and moss proliferation across the site.
  - Disturbance reduction may explain declines in SR/C-S-R species across treatments.
- Fertilisation effect
  - Nutrient enrichment increases productivity, particularly when combined with lime; high lime rates may increase pH to levels that constrain moisture availability and induce stress in some taxa.
  - Nutrient-rich environments favor competitive, C-S-R species; in unfertilised plots, stress-tolerant species benefit as nutrients are progressively lost from clipping removal.
- Insecticide effect
  - Patterns consistent with some insect-plant interaction literature: reduction in herbivory might support a broader array of palatable species; however, evidence insufficient to claim a direct causal link to increased diversity.
- Trampling effect
  - The 2002 drop in C2 plot productivity is attributed to trampling during intense sampling-related activity (13CO2 pulses) rather than a sustained treatment effect.
- Biodiversity and functional composition
  - The study demonstrates measurable shifts in biodiversity metrics (Shannon index, PCA grouping) and functional composition (CSR dynamics) in response to management practices.
  - Bryophytes play an increasingly prominent role in unimproved plots, and their rise corresponds with reduced nutrient input and disturbance.

## Data Quality, Access, and Gaps
- Data richness: extensive biomass, species, bryophyte, soil, and microclimate data across four years; 11621 soil samples collected since start.
- Data gaps: 2002 weather data gaps due to a station malfunction; some plots’ insecticide and nitrogen/lime interactions not fully resolved due to data gaps or limited replication in certain years.
- Data accessibility: datasets and metadata intended to be discoverable via Soil Biodiversity portals; full appendices provide detailed species lists and per-plot measurements.

## Key Takeaways for Data-Driven Analysis
- Longitudinal patterns show fertilisation (especially N+L) elevates productivity but can reduce diversity over time; disturbance removal (mowing) shifts communities toward stress-tolerant and bryophytic assemblages.
- Soil chemistry (pH) and moisture mediate productivity and species composition; higher pH generally associates with higher biomass but interacts with specific fertilizer regimes.
- Functional-group composition (CSR framework) provides a robust lens to interpret community responses to treatments, highlighting shifts from stress-tolerators to competitors under nutrient enrichment.
- Insecticide effects on plant diversity are suggested but require more controlled, direct measurement to establish causality.
- For replication and future analyses, consider mixed-model approaches to capture block, year, and treatment interactions; leverage PCA/ordination results to link species-level changes to functional group shifts; explore time-lag effects of lime-induced pH changes on biomass and diversity.
