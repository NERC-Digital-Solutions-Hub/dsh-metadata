# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, the site has been monitored for above-ground biomass production (productivity), plant species composition and diversity to understand how mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide treatment affect plant communities and ecosystem function.
- The project uses a factorial field design with five replicate blocks, multiple plots per block, and a 0.5 m2 sampling cell system to collect consistent, comparable data over time.
- Data collected span climate, soil, vegetation, and species composition, enabling analysis of how management treatments influence productivity, community structure, and functional traits.

## Data Collected and Study Design

- Site and treatments
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated randomly.
  - Treatments include: Control 1, Control 2 (no treatments), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen + Lime, Insecticide; managed with monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–September) and post-mow insecticide applications (Dursban 4 OPA) on designated plots; nitrogen and/or lime applied in spring.
- Data collection and measures
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (rainfall, radiation, air and soil temperatures, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground biomass: annual 5-sample harvest per plot (0.5 m2 cell), dried and weighed; data collected since 1999.
  - Baseline and Point Analysis surveys: 0.5 m2 cells with 25-point baseline survey (1998); annual 0.5 m2 cell point analyses in 2000–2002 using a 100-hole grid to record species presence at the soil surface; bryophytes identified to species level in 2002.
  - Soil pH: measured in 5 cm depth (H2O) at baseline (1998) and August 2002; soil moisture measured with theta probe in 2002 at survey cells.
  - Additional small surveys: vegetation cover, biomass sorting by species, and various targeted ecological surveys.
  - Species data: extensive vascular plant and bryophyte lists; 2002 dataset includes a comprehensive bryophyte component and a detailed species rank-abundance analysis.
- Data analysis approaches
  - Biomass analyses with split-plot ANOVA (Genstat) across years (1999–2002) and treatments.
  - Correlations and regressions between soil pH, moisture, and above-ground productivity.
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of point-analysis data to differentiate treatment groups by species composition.
  - Shannon Diversity Index calculations to assess changes in diversity across years and treatments.
  - Functional-group classifications (stress-tolerators S; competitive-stress-ruderals CSR; SR/CSR) to interpret shifts in plant strategy over time and under treatments.

## Key Findings

- Mowing effects
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across most plots, suggesting a site-level response to mowing rather than a treatment-specific effect.
  - Festuca rubra expanded particularly in the more fertile, lime- or nitrogen-treated plots, indicating competitive release under higher nutrient availability.
  - Bryophytes (mosses) expanded across the site, likely aided by the ~6 cm mowing height and historical lack of grazing, with moss prevalence higher in unimproved plots.
  - Overall, there was a general shift toward stress-tolerant species in unimproved plots, with reductions in SR/C-S-R groups under mowing disturbance.

- Fertilisation effects
  - Productivity (biomass) increased with nutrient amendments; plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime showed higher productivity than unfertilised plots, with the strongest gains in plots where both nitrogen and lime were applied.
  - Mean soil pH rose toward 7.0 in limed plots, correlating with higher productivity in the upper soil profile; however, very high pH and lowered soil moisture in some lime-treated plots could reduce productivity under drought.
  - The relationship between pH and biomass was positive on average, but within treatments the pattern varied; specifically, in nitrogen-plus-lime plots the pH-biomass relationship could become negative, suggesting complex soil-plant interactions at high pH.
  - Functional-group shifts occurred: CSR (competitive-stress) species became more dominant in nitrogen-and-lime plots, while stress-tolerant species thrived more in unimproved plots. In unimproved and lime-only plots, stress-tolerant species tended to benefit most from disturbances and nutrient changes.

- Insecticide effects
  - The insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) plots showed higher vascular plant diversity in some comparisons, but direct causality between reduced herbivory and increased diversity is not conclusively established in this dataset.
  - The observed patterns align with prior studies showing herbivore-mediated changes in plant communities, though results depend on insecticide type and life-history groups of plants.

- Trampling and other factors
  - The C2 plots (first-time 2002 sampling) experienced unusually low productivity, likely due to trampling during intense activities associated with 13CO2 pulse experiments, rather than a long-term treatment effect.

- Biodiversity and functional groups
  - Point-analysis data reveal clear treatment-driven shifts in the relative abundance of key functional groups (stress tolerators, CSR, SR/CSR), with significant differences emerging by 2000–2002.
  - Bryophyte hits rose across treatments, with varying effects on overall plant diversity depending on the combination of treatments.

- Data notes and variability
  - 2002 weather data included missing periods due to a weather-station malfunction; data from nearby station were substituted for July–Nov 2002.
  - Control 2 plots were not surveyed in 2000–2001 in some appendices, affecting cross-year comparability for those datasets.
  - Across plots and years, biomass generally rose from 1999 to 2002, but in 2002 there were notable reductions in several treatments, with the most pronounced declines in certain plots on steeper slopes.

## Data Quality, Gaps and Limitations

- Notable data gaps
  - 2002 weather data gaps due to on-site station issues; partial data replacement used from a nearby station.
  - Some plot-level surveys (e.g., Control 2) were omitted in 2000–2001 in certain datasets.
- Data volume
  - The project has generated a large dataset across soils, plant surveys, and biomass, including over 11,000 soil samples to date.
- Analytical complexity
  - Mixed results across treatments and years require careful interpretation of interactions (treatment × year) and context of environmental drivers (pH, moisture, nutrient status).

## Data Products and Opportunities for Data Support

- Potential data products for end users
  - Interactive dashboards: biomass by treatment over time; comparison of N, Lime, N+L, and Insecticide effects across years.
  - Environmental drivers: dashboards linking productivity with soil pH, soil moisture, and weather variables.
  - Biodiversity visuals: PCA plots and diversity indices (Shannon) by treatment and year to illustrate community shifts.
  - Functional group dynamics: charts showing proportions of S, CSR, SR/CSR groups by treatment over time.
  - Species-level insights: rank-abundance heatmaps showing dominant species under each treatment, including bryophyte dynamics.
- Data management considerations for Data Support
  - Maintain clear data provenance: treatment, block, year, and subplot identifiers; document any missing data periods (e.g., 2002 weather gaps).
  - Create a data dictionary and metadata for all datasets (biomass, soil pH, moisture, point analyses, species lists).
  - Facilitate data reuse by providing standardized formats (CSV/TSV/JSON) and machine-readable species codes (Appendix 3 references).
  - Connect datasets (biomass → soil chemistry → biodiversity metrics) to enable integrated analyses and dashboards.
  - Share outputs and early prototypes to promote data use, feedback, and iterative product development.
