Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report 2002

## Overview
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders).
- Focused on above-ground biomass productivity, plant species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) under five main treatments across replicated blocks.
- Three key management processes driving botanical change: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and insecticide application.
- Aimed to understand how soil biodiversity links to above-ground plant communities and how functional groups respond to management.

## Site, Treatments and Data Collection
- Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; plots randomly assigned to treatments.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1 (unmanipulated), Control 2 (unmanipulated), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA).
- Site management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept); insecticide applied after mowing in designated plots; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime as specified.
- Data collection (since 1999–2002): 
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station.
  - Above-ground productivity via 0.5 m2 clips per plot, dried and weighed (five cuts per summer; 1999–2002).
  - Baseline and annual vegetation surveys using 0.5 m2 plots and 100-point quadrats (2000, 2001, 2002), plus species lists (Appendices).
  - Soil sampling for pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe) across plots/cells; additional small-scale botanical surveys and biomass sampling.
  - Ongoing site activity: Phase I projects largely finished by 2002; Phase II ongoing with fieldwork and 13CO2 pulse experiments.

## Key Findings

### Mowing Effect
- Dominant shift away from Agrostis spp. toward Festuca spp. (notably Festuca rubra) as mowing became the regular management.
- Bryophytes (mosses) expanded across the sward height (~6 cm) and were more prevalent in unfertilised plots.
- Stress-tolerant species expanded broadly, especially where disturbance was reduced by removing grazing.

### Fertilisation Effect
- Productivity consistently higher in fertilised plots; strongest response where nitrogen and lime were both applied.
- Potential peak in productivity in plots with both N and lime; mean soil pH in these plots approached 7.0 by 2002.
- Soil moisture appeared lower in N+L plots, potentially increasing drought stress during dry periods and contributing to chlorosis in some vegetation.
- Functional shift: C-S-R (competitiveness-stress-ruderal) species expanded in N+L plots, while stress-tolerant species benefited in unfertilised plots.

### Insecticide Effect
- Diversity changes are not definitively linked to Dursban 4 application; evidence is circumstantial.
- Trends mirror earlier work suggesting reduced herbivory may allow more palatable species to persist, potentially increasing diversity, but causation remains uncertain.

### Trampling Effect
- C2 plots (insecticide/other management changes) showed notable productivity declines in 2002 likely due to trampling during intense data/pulse-labeling activities.

### Plant Diversity and Community Structure (Point Analysis)
- 2002 Point Analysis: 
  - Improved plots (N, Lime, N&L) showed increasing hits by Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots remained dominated by Agrostis spp. but with declines in some species.
  - Bryophyte hits rose across treatments, particularly Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, contributing to bryophyte-dominated early surveys.
  - Litter (dead vegetation) hits showed significant treatment differences from 2001–2002, with higher litter in fertilised plots.
- Community composition analyses (PCA) separated improved vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots formed a distinct group; some nitrogen plots shared characteristics with lime plots.
- Functional groups (S, CSR, SR/CSR) accounted for the majority of hits (69–95%) in plots, with shifts by treatment:
  - C-S-R species expanded most where N and lime were applied.
  - Stress-tolerant (S) species favored unimproved plots.
  - SR/CSR reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.

### Diversity Indices
- Shannon diversity indices rose after 1998 baseline in most treatments, but declined in 2002 for Nitrogen & Lime plots (about 15% lower than baseline), while other treatments showed increases (up to ~29% in some, e.g., insecticide plots).

### Biomass and Productivity Trends
- Overall biomass productivity increased across treatments from 1999 to 2002, but 2002 saw a decline in several treatments relative to 2001.
- The greatest biomass gain remained in plots with both nitrogen and lime; Control 2 plots consistently lagged behind others in productivity.
- A clear slope-related pattern showed block position on the slope affecting productivity, with lower blocks occasionally showing larger fluctuations.

## Data, Monitoring and Implications

- The study demonstrates the value of standardized, time-series monitoring for environmental health:
  - Regularly collected data types: biomass productivity, species composition (vascular plants and bryophytes), functional group composition, soil pH, soil moisture, and weather metrics.
  - Longitudinal, multi-factor analysis (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide, trampling) enables attribution of observed changes to management actions and site conditions.
- Data management and accessibility:
  - Data have been generated across multiple projects with a consistent framework and are organized by plot, treatment, and year.
  - The initiative highlights the importance of making underlying data accessible for cross-study analyses and data integration with other environmental datasets.

## Takeaways for Environmental Monitoring and Policy

- Routine mowing and nutrient management can shift plant communities toward competitive, less diverse states in fertilised plots, while promoting stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities in unfertilised conditions.
- Lime-driven pH increases can enhance productivity up to a point but may reduce moisture availability, potentially limiting long-term productivity gains.
- Insecticide effects on diversity remain uncertain; any observed changes may result from complex plant-herbivore dynamics and the broader environment.
- Trampling during intensive experimental activities can confound biomass estimates and should be accounted for in study designs.
- For environmental monitoring, integrating above-ground vegetation metrics with soil chemistry, moisture, and disturbance regime provides a robust approach to detecting ecosystem responses over time.
