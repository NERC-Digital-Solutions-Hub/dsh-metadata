# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and purpose
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on Sourhope field experiment in the Scottish Borders.
  - Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for more detailed studies and to enable cross-year comparisons and links to other data sets.
  - Baseline data survey completed in 1998; monitoring complemented by standardized measurements across years.
  - 2001 site management was affected by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions and a change of site officer, with protocols maintained to safeguard data integrity.

- Data collected and measurement framework
  - Automatic Weather Station data collected at Sourhope (1999–2001): rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture, with values near long-term averages in 2001.
  - Above-ground biomass: measured across multiple treatments; peaks in July/August; notable 2001 increase likely due to staff changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears; analysis used log-transformed data and ANOVA.
  - Soil pH: upper 5 cm measured; liming raised pH to 6.19 (limed plots) and 6.38 (N + Lime plots); nitrogen alone raised pH modestly; control plots unchanged since baseline (1998).
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) mirrored 2000 methodology; high inter-surveyor agreement confirmed; 58% more total hits in 2001 than 2000; shifts in species dominance with treatments.
  - Data collection schedule and methods: detailed in Table 1; mowing, biomass harvesting, botanical surveys, and soil/biota measurements conducted at specified dates; use of standardized plots and subplots; data managed with Central Environmental/HER databases; Genstat 5 used for analyses (ANOVA, PCA).

- Key results by data type
  - Weather (2.1)
    - 2001 headline weather generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after very wet prior year; radiation similar; slight temperature decrease and higher soil moisture vs. prior years.
  - Above-ground biomass (2.2)
    - Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak biomass in mid-summer (July/August).
    - 2001 biomass higher than 1999–2000, likely due to personnel changes and use of mechanical cutting.
    - Nitrogen and/or Lime treatments most effective for biomass; ANOVA shows significant treatment-year interactions; no significant block effects.
    - Separate analyses show positive links between fertilization (N and/or lime) and biomass; biomass increases correlated with certain species (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis).
  - Soil pH (2.3)
    - Liming consistently raised surface pH; 6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots by Oct 2001.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH modestly; Control plot pH remained near baseline.
  - Botanical composition (2.4)
    - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen+Lime plots, suggesting diversity shifts with improved fertility.
    - Agrostis capillaris declined broadly in 2001; Festuca spp. and Poa spp. became more prevalent in fertilized/improved plots.
    - PCA indicates clear separation of improved plots (N and/or L) from unimproved ones; unimproved plots show more bryophytes and acid-soil-associated species.
    - Biomass and species composition are positively correlated: higher biomass associated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; opposite trend for some species (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) as biomass increases.
    - Increased litter in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

- Site heterogeneity and data variability (3)
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F showed comparatively more acidic conditions; several plots with lower biomass were scattered, but central-area plots often had higher biomass.
  - Site-wide pH and biomass were positively correlated, though no significant differences between blocks were detected.
  - Biodiversity and biomass variation highlight the importance of accounting for spatial structure in analyses.

- Management impacts on data and interpretation
  - FMD restrictions in 2001 limited site access Feb–May; activities proceeded under a formal protocol once access resumed.
  - First biocide application in May 2001 was missed; subsequent applications completed.
  - Change of Officer in Charge (May 2001) coincided with a notable shift in biomass data, addressed by normalizing biomass against a reference plot (C1) to assess treatment effects across years.

- Data quality, governance and future use
  - Inter-surveyor consistency confirmed for Point Quadrat botanical surveys (no significant difference between surveyors).
  - Standardized measurement protocols and cross-year comparability evident; data prepared to support both site-level interpretation and integration with related projects.
  - Results emphasize the need to consider both soil chemistry (pH, fertility) and vegetation dynamics (species composition, biomass) when assessing data assets in long-term field experiments.

- Implications for data strategy and practice
  - The Sourhope dataset demonstrates value in: long-term, multi-variable monitoring; standardized protocols; and explicit handling of site heterogeneity in analyses.
  - When planning data governance, ensure clear documentation of measurement schedules, treatment definitions, and any site-management disruptions.
  - Maintain robust metadata that captures treatment effects, spatial layout, and any protocol deviations (e.g., missing applications due to external events) to support reproducibility and cross-site comparisons.
