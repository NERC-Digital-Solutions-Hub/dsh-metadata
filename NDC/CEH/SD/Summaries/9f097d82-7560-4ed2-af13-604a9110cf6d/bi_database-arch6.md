# A taxonomic, genetic and ecological data resource for the vascular plants of Britain and Ireland

- A comprehensive, open-access data repository linking taxonomic, genetic, and ecological information for native and alien vascular plants in Britain and Ireland (BI).
- Built from the most recent BI flora reference, with taxon names linked to unique identifiers (Kew IDs) and DNA barcode data.
- Includes 3,209 extant species (1,468 native, 1,690 alien, 51 unknown status) plus 18 extinct species; 26 trait categories and extensive metadata.

## Overview of data resource

- Purpose: enable fast, online access for ecological, evolutionary, and conservation analyses; support both fundamental science and applied decision-making.
- Coverage: extant vascular plants in BI (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Isle of Man, Channel Islands) including native and non-native species.
- Taxonomy and standardization: names reconciled to World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) with kew_id and links to WCVP, POWO, and IPNI for stable nomenclature.

## Data contents (types and scope)

- Taxonomy and status
  - Accepted higher taxonomy (order, family) and species-level nomenclature; full native/alien status with hyphenated categories (native, archaeophyte, neophyte, denizen, etc.).
  - Data sources: Stace (2019), PLANTATT/ALIENATT, Alien Plants, BSBI distributions.
- Functional traits (26 traits summarized; most data from TRY)
  - Five key functional traits: Specific Leaf Area (SLA), Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC), seed mass, leaf area, vegetative height (plus maximum height).
  - Coverage: variable by trait; maximum values and species means provided.
- Realized niche and environmental preferences
  - Ellenberg indicator values for light (L), moisture (F), reaction (R), nutrients (N), salinity (S), temperature (T) where available.
  - Supplements Ellenberg data with Central European assessments (Döring) for non-native species to improve coverage.
- Life strategy and growth form
  - Grime CSR framework (Competitor C, Stress-tolerator S, Ruderal R) with imputation for species lacking direct data.
  - Raunkiaer life-form categories (e.g., chamaephyte, hemicryptophyte, etc.) and succulent classification.
- Biomes and origin
  - Associated biomes per species (Ecoflora-derived) and origin region for non-natives (adapted to WGSRPD TDWG level 1).
- Species distributions
  - Distribution metrics as number of 10-km hectads in BI; data sourced from BSBI Distribution Database; separate for Great Britain, Ireland, Channel Islands.
  - Not corrected for sampling bias; intended as trend indicators.
- Hybrid propensity
  - Hybridization data for 641 species (821 combinations after filtering) with a per-species hybrid propensity score and a genus-weighted score.
- DNA barcodes
  - Barcode data (rbcL, matK, ITS2) linked via BOLD for 1,413 BI species; 935 species with all three markers; links to BOLD records.
- Genome size and chromosome counts
  - Genome sizes for 2,117 specimens (including 467 BI-origin measurements newly generated by flow cytometry); chromosome counts for 1,410 species from BI material, plus external sources to fill gaps.
  - BI-origin filter available to exclude non-BI material when needed.
- Data integration and cross-references
  - Fields linking to WCVP, POWO, IPNI; taxonomic status, and URLs for authoritative pages.
  - Supplementary datasets: GS_BI.csv, GS_Kew_BI.csv, chrom_num_BI.csv; Detailed_sources.csv with full references.

## Data generation and methodology

- Species list construction
  - Derived from New Flora of the British Isles (Fourth Edition) index; cleaning to remove hybrids, questionable records, and non-flora taxa; final extant species: 3,209 plus 18 extinct.
  - Unclear_species_marker flag for genera with microspecies complexity to enable exclusion from analyses.
- Taxonomy and nomenclature
  - Names checked with Global Names Resolver, cross-verified against NCBI and WCVP; kew_id assigned; accessibility links provided.
- Native status and distribution
  - Native/non-native status drawn from Stace (2019), PLANTATT/ALIENATT, and Alien Plants; native vs archaeophyte vs neophyte classifications included.
  - Distribution metrics derived from BSBI records; hectad-level occurrences used for BI trend context.
- Functional traits and niches
  - TRY trait data for selected traits; interpolation and imputation where direct measurements are missing; Ellenberg values compiled from PLANTATT and Döring sources.
  - CSR strategies imputed using trait-based methods when direct CSR data were missing.
- Biomes, origin, and ecology
  - Biome assignments from Ecoflora; origin for non-natives described by region of introduction; WGSRPD TDWG level 1 coding used for consistency.
- Genomics and cytology
  - Genome size and chromosome counts obtained from multiple sources; BI-origin origin flag included; new BI material measured via flow cytometry using standardized protocols.

## Data records and access

- Primary data package
  - BI_main.csv: core taxon list with kew_id, taxonomy, traits, distribution, and ecology.
  - Additional data files: chrom_num_BI.csv (chromosome counts), GS_BI.csv and GS_Kew_BI.csv (genome sizes), plus metadata.
- Documentation and provenance
  - Database_structure.csv: data categories and trait coverage explanations.

  - Static data release available at the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre.
  - BIFloraExplorer R package (GitHub) for reproducible access and updates.
  - Links to WCVP, POWO, and IPNI for taxonomy pages embedded in the dataset.

## Technical validation and quality assurance

- Data compilation draws from peer-reviewed sources, field guides, and public databases with explicit references.
- Validation steps include manual name reconciliation, cross-checks against major taxonomic resources, and spot checks during data extraction.
- Unpublished data generated by authors (e.g., genome sizes) follow established protocols or peer-reviewed methods; provenance and calibration details provided.

## Use cases and potential impact

- Facilitates trait-based analyses, species distribution modelling, and ecological forecasting for BI flora under climate change and biodiversity loss scenarios.
- Supports conservation planning, red-list assessments, seed banking decisions, and biodiversity monitoring by providing integrated, harmonized data across taxonomy, genetics, and ecology.
- Enables researchers and policymakers to explore relationships among taxonomy, genome size, traits, niches, distributions, and hybridization within BI flora.

## Limitations and considerations

- Trait and data coverage vary by category (e.g., CSR data coverage limited; non-native barcode data still growing).
- Distribution metrics are indicative and not corrected for sampling bias; caution required for quantitative inference.
- Some microspecies and complex taxa flagged with unclear_species_marker to avoid misinterpretation in analyses.

## Contact and provenance

- Data prepared by a multi-institution team; updates and new releases planned, including expanding non-native barcode coverage and taxonomic updates.
