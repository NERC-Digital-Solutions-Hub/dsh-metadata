# THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS

## Overview
- Describes the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) and how it monitors contaminant concentrations in predatory birds in Britain.
- Focuses on why certain matrices (liver, eggs) are used for specific contaminants and species.
- Highlights the long-term data resource, collaboration with multiple research and policy bodies, and the feedback loop to volunteers.

## Data Collection and Matrices
- Primary matrices: liver tissues and addled/deserted eggs, chosen based on the toxicological significance of contaminants and species biology.
- Rationale for matrix choices examples:
  - Liver for SGARs (anticoagulant rodenticides) due to targeting of clotting factors.
  - Eggs for embryotoxic contaminants when eggshell or contents better reflect exposure in certain species.
- Species considerations: for rare species (e.g., golden eagle, merlin) eggs are sampled to achieve robust data where carcass numbers are low.

## Sampling, Postmortem and Metadata
- Sampling relies on public submissions prompted by advertisements; also receives specimens from taxidermists and wildlife rehabilitation centers.
- Eligibility: only birds that were freeliving before death or in captivity for ≤7 days.
- Submissions: ~400 birds/year; peak submissions in autumn (Sept–Oct) and early spring (Feb–Apr) comprising mainly juveniles.
- On receipt: bird details logged; carcass stored at -20°C until postmortem.
- Postmortem data collected: age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, putative cause of death; additional observations include fat reserves, moult scores, hemorrhaging.
- Tissues archived: whole organs excised and weighed; liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, and subcutaneous fat archived at -20°C.
  
## Eggs Data
- Egg collection: licensed collectors sample addled or deserted eggs from nests; eggs sent to PBMS.
- On receipt and processing: record length, breadth, weight, date of collection, provenance; contents assessed after cracking and homogenized for archiving at -20°C.
- Shell measurements: eggshell thickness index calculated as shell weight (mg) divided by (length × breadth).
- Used data: eggs from merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle, with contents and developmental stage documented.

## Core Monitoring Program and Analyses
- Core analyses:
  - Livers from a stratified sample of sparrowhawks; livers of all herons; one egg per clutch for merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle.
  - Contaminants analyzed: PCB congeners and TEQs, organochlorine (OC) insecticides, mercury; SGARs (difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, flocoumafen) in livers of barn owls and all kestrels and red kites.
  - Gannet eggs (approx. 10 per year from Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig) analyzed for the same contaminants.
- Analysis: conducted by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology using established methods described in related references.
- Outputs: results published in annual reports and scientific papers; a PBMS dedicated webpage provides access to findings.

## Data Outputs, Access, and Feedback
- Feedback to volunteers: post-mortem reports or biometric data provided for each sample; a summary of analyzed contaminant levels shared for submitted samples.
- Data products support ongoing engagement with citizen scientists and maintain the volunteer base.

## Data Archive and Long-Term Resource
- Frozen archive: ~17,500 tissue samples from 6,000 individual birds and ~9,000 egg contents; dating back to 1968.
- Temporal coverage: majority (82%) of tissue samples originate from 1980 onwards.
- Archive value: supports broad environmental toxicology studies, conservation research, piloting/refining new monitoring methods, and assessment of nonchemical threats (e.g., illegal trading, genetic studies in golden eagles).

## Data Governance, Collaboration, and Funding
- Governance and support: PBMS is funded and supported by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England, Environment Agency, and the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use.
- Collaboration: relies on volunteer networks and contributes to policy-relevant knowledge through reports and peer-reviewed work.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates a data-centric, stakeholder-engaged monitoring program that turns heterogeneous, volunteer-sourced specimens into a robust, long-term environmental data asset.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Aligning data collection with toxicological relevance and species biology.
  - Standardized data capture, metadata (age, cause of death, tissue type), and archiving for future use.
  - Transparent data processing and dissemination, plus meaningful feedback loops to contributors.
  - Long-term archiving enabling retrospective analyses and cross-disciplinary use (ecology, toxicology, genetics, policy).
  - Cross-institution collaboration and diversified funding to sustain data assets and impact.
