# THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS - taken from Lee A. Walker, Richard F. Shore, Anthony Turk, M. Gloria Pereira and Jennifer Best, The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme: Identifying Chemical Risks to Top Predators in Britain, 2008, Ambio Vol. 37, No. 6, 466-471.

## Overview
- Describes how the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) operates to monitor contaminant concentrations in top predators in Britain.
- Uses specific biological matrices (liver tissue or eggs) depending on the toxin and the study species.
- Combines field collection by volunteers with centralized post-mortem examination, laboratory analysis, and data dissemination.

## Sampling and Specimen Handling
- Matrices and rationale:
  - Liver for SGARs and certain contaminants (target organ for these pesticides).
  - Eggs for embryotoxic contaminants when adults are scarce or difficult to sample.
- Sample sources and timing:
  - Submissions from the public (advertised), taxidermists, and wildlife rehabilitation centers; only freeliving birds or newly captive for ≤7 days used.
  - Approximately 400 birds submitted annually; peak submissions in autumn (Sept–Oct) and late winter/spring (Feb–Apr).
- Processing on receipt:
  - Details logged; carcasses stored at -20°C until postmortem.
  - Eggs collected from licensed nests, with data on collection date and provenance.
- Postmortem and measurements:
  - Age, sex, body weight, and putative cause of death determined using standard classifications (EURING codes).
  - Additional metrics: fat reserves, moult scores, presence of hemorrhaging; organs excised and weighed; tissues archived at -20°C.

## Data Capture and Metadata
- Comprehensive data collection upon receipt and examination:
  - Detailed metadata for each specimen (age, sex, weight, cause of death, condition of organs, etc.).
  - Egg measurements: length, breadth, weight, contents weight; eggshell thickness index calculated as shell weight/length x breadth.
- Consistency and standards:
  - Uses EURING classification for age and standardized measurement protocols for eggs and tissues.
- Data updates and provenance:
  - Core data are captured at submission and refined through postmortem analyses; archived specimens and associated data are preserved for future studies.

## Laboratory Analyses and Contaminants
- Core analytical program:
  - Livers from stratified samples of sparrowhawks, all herons, and eggs from merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle clutches analyzed for PCBs, OC insecticides, and mercury.
  - Gannet eggs for PCB-related analyses (biennial collection at some colonies).
  - Livers from barn owls and livers of kestrels and red kites analyzed for four SGARs (difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, flocoumafen).
- Conducted by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) using established methods described in cited references.
- Outputs:
  - Results published in annual reports, scientific papers, and on the PBMS website.
  - Feedback provided to volunteers: postmortem reports or biometric data for eggs; a summary of contaminant levels for chemically analyzed samples.

## Data Dissemination and Feedback
- Public-facing outputs:
  - Annual reports and a dedicated PBMS webpage disseminate findings to the scientific community and the public.
- Stakeholder engagement:
  - Volunteers receive timely feedback, strengthening ongoing participation and data quality.

## Archive and Data Reuse
- PBMS frozen archive:
  - ~17,500 tissue samples from ~6,000 birds and ~9,000 egg contents.
  - Majority (82%) of tissue samples originate from 1980 onwards; samples dating back to 1968.
- Archival value:
  - A valuable resource for environmental toxicology and conservation research beyond core PBMS aims.
  - Enables broader studies on nonchemical threats, piloting new monitoring approaches, and genetic or ecological investigations (e.g., population genetics, illegal trade impacts).

## Governance, Collaboration, and Funding
- Partners and funders:
  - PBMS is supported by CEH, JNCC, Natural England, Environment Agency, and the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use.
- Stakeholder relationships:
  - Strong engagement with the public and volunteer network; recognition of contributions in sustained data collection and archive growth.

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- Data governance and standards:
  - Clear provenance from collection to analysis; standardized metadata (age, sex, weight, cause of death, appendages, tissues).
  - Consistent sample handling, storage at -20°C, and documented postmortem procedures.
- Data quality and interoperability:
  - Use of standardized classifications (EURING), measurement protocols, and centralized analyses to ensure comparability across years and species.
- Data lifecycle and sharing:
  - Regular core datasets (annual analyses) with open dissemination via reports and a dedicated webpage.
  - Archival strategy enables long-term data preservation and reuse for new research questions.
- User-centric considerations:
  - Feedback to contributors supports ongoing participation and improves data completeness and accuracy.
