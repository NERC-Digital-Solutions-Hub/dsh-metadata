# The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme: Identifying Chemical Risks to Top Predators in Britain

## Overview
- The PBMS monitors contaminant concentrations primarily in liver tissues and in addled or deserted eggs.
- Matrix choice depends on the chemical’s site of significance and the bird species studied.
- The program adapts to rare species by using eggs when carcass sample sizes are insufficient (e.g., golden eagle, merlin).

## Data collection and sources
- Submissions come from the public (advertised calls), taxidermists, and wildlife rehabilitation centers.
- Only free-ranging birds (or in captivity ≤ 7 days) are used.
- Approximately 400 birds are submitted annually.
- Submissions peak in autumn (Sept–Oct) and early spring (Feb–Apr), with these five months making up about 60% of annual submissions.

## Sampling, processing, and storage
- On receipt, each bird is logged; carcasses are stored at -20°C until postmortem examination.
- Postmortem collects data on age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, and putative death cause; additional observations include fat reserves, moult scores, and hemorrhaging.
- Organs are weighed; tissues (liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, subcutaneous fat) archived at -20°C.
- Eggs from licensed collectors are measured (length, breadth, weight, contents weight); contents are homogenized and archived at -20°C; eggshell thickness index calculated as shell weight (mg) / (length × breadth in mm).

## Core monitoring program and sampling design
- Liver samples from a stratified subset of sparrowhawks and livers from all collected herons are analyzed.
- Contents of one egg from each clutch of merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle are analyzed.
- Gannet eggs (~10 per colony) are analyzed biennially from Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig.
- Livers from a stratified sample of barn owls, plus all kestrels and red kites, are analyzed for specific rodenticide residues (SGARs: difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, flocoumafen).
- All analyses focus on PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, PCB-TEQs), organochlorine (OC) insecticides, and mercury.

## Analytical methods and dissemination
- Analyses are conducted by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology; specific methods are described in other publications.
- Results are published in annual reports, scientific papers, and on a dedicated PBMS webpage.
- Volunteers receive feedback: postmortem reports (for carcasses) or biometric data (for eggs) and a contaminant summary for samples analyzed chemically.

## Archive and research utility
- The PBMS frozen archive contains ~17,500 tissue samples from ~6,000 birds and ~9,000 egg contents; dating back to 1968.
- Most tissue samples come from 1980 onwards (82%).
- The archive supports broader environmental toxicology studies and conservation research (e.g., nonchemical threats, illegal trade investigations, genetic studies in golden eagles).
- It enables piloting and refining new monitoring methods.

## Enduring value and applications
- The PBMS data enable assessment of chemical exposure and potential effects on predatory birds.
- The archive and grid of samples support long-term trend analysis, spatial studies, and policy-relevant monitoring.

## Governance, funding, and acknowledgement
- PBMS is supported by funding from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England, Environment Agency, and the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use.
- Public participants and submitters are essential partners to the program.
