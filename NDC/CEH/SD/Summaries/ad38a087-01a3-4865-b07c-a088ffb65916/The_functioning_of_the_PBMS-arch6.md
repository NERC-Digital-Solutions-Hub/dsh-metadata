# THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS - taken from Lee A. Walker, Richard F. Shore, Anthony Turk, M. Glo ´ria Pereira and Jennifer Best, The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme: Identifying Chemical Risks to Top Predators in Britain, 2008, Ambio Vol. 37, No. 6, 466-471.

## Overview
- Describes the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) and how it operates to identify chemical risks to top predators in Britain.
- Uses different biological matrices (liver vs. eggs) depending on the toxicological relevance for each compound and species.
- Aims to enable monitoring of contaminant exposure across multiple predatory bird species and contexts, including rare species.

## Data Sources and Specimens
- Specimens come from public submissions, taxidermists, and wildlife rehabilitation centers; only freeliving birds or those in captivity for ≤7 days are used.
- Submissions average ~400 birds per year, with peaks in autumn (Sept–Oct) and early spring (Feb–Apr), totaling about 60% in five months.
- On receipt, carcasses are logged and stored at -20°C until postmortem examination (PME).
- Eggs are collected by licensed collectors during nests and sent to PBMS; only addled or deserted eggs are used.

## Sampling and Data Collection
- Postmortem examination records age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, and putative cause of death; major causes include road traffic accidents, other collisions, and starvation.
- Additional observations: fat reserves, moult scores, and hemorrhaging; organs may be weighed and tissues archived (liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, subcutaneous fat).
- Eggs: length, breadth, weight, date and provenance of collection, and contents weight are recorded; eggs are opened, development staged, contents homogenized, and shell thickness index calculated.

## Data Structure and Sample Characteristics
- Age and sex, order of species, and counts are tracked; juveniles dominate submissions, reflected in an approximate 1.8:1 juvenile-to-adult ratio.
- The Programme maintains a frozen archive of samples dating back to 1968, enabling longitudinal and retrospective analyses.

## Laboratory Analysis and Core Monitoring
- Core contaminants analyzed include:
  - PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, PCB-TEQs) and organochlorine insecticides in livers and eggs.
  - Mercury in relevant tissues.
  - SGARs (difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, flocoumafen) in livers (barn owls, kestrels, red kites).
  - Gannet eggs from specific colonies are analyzed biennially for the same suite of compounds.
- Analyses are performed by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology using established methods described in related publications.

## Data Processing and Quality Assurance
- Data are logged at receipt, cleaned, and transformed for integration across matrices (liver and eggs) and species.
- Results are quality-checked and prepared for publication in annual reports, scientific papers, and on the PBMS website.

## Outputs, Feedback, and Public Engagement
- Outputs published annually and in scientific literature; a dedicated PBMS webpage provides access to results.
- Volunteer collectors receive postoperative reports or biometric summaries, along with aggregated contaminant summaries when available.
- Feedback is essential for maintaining strong engagement with volunteers and sustaining data collection.

## Archive, Reuse, and Potential Analyses
- The PBMS archive comprises approximately:
  - 17,500 tissue samples from 6,000 individual birds.
  - 9,000 egg contents.
  - 82% of tissue samples originate from 1980 onward.
- The archive supports broader environmental toxicology studies, piloting and refining new monitoring approaches, and projects addressing non-chemical threats (e.g., illegal trade, population genetics).

## Governance, Partnerships, and Funding
- PBMS is funded by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England, Environment Agency, and the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use.
- The program acknowledges contributions from the public, taxidermists, and wildlife centers as integral to its success.

## Key Insights for Data Support
- The program demonstrates how multi-matrix monitoring (liver vs. eggs) can be tailored to the toxicology of specific compounds and species.
- Emphasizes robust data logging, traceability, and archiving to enable long-term trend analysis and cross-study reuse.
- Highlights the importance of timely feedback to data providers to sustain participation and data quality.
- Shows how aggregated results feed into public reports, scientific publications, and policy-relevant insights for conservation and chemical risk management.
