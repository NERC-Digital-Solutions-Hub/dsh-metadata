# THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS

## Overview
- Describes how the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) operates to identify chemical risks to top predators in Britain.
- Uses different biological matrices (liver tissue and eggs) depending on the toxicological significance of each compound and species considerations.
- Combines public participation, led by volunteers and professionals, with scientific analysis and reporting.

## Sampling and Matrices
- Matrix choice driven by site of toxicological significance per compound:
  - Liver: targeted for SGARs and many organochlorines (e.g., PCBs), due to high affinity and relevance to adult metabolism.
  - Eggs: used for embryotoxins or when certain species yield insufficient carcasses for liver analysis (e.g., rare species like golden eagle and merlin).
- Species-specific sampling rationale:
  - Rare species with low densities (e.g., golden eagle, merlin) rely on eggs to assess chemical exposure.
- Annual intake of samples:
  - Approximately 400 birds submitted each year from the public, taxidermists, and wildlife rehabilitation centers.
- Submission timing:
  - Peak submissions in autumn (Sept–Oct) and late winter/early spring (Feb–Apr), ~60% within five months.
- Eligibility:
  - Only freeliving birds or those in captivity for ≤7 days are used; eggs are collected from licensed nest visits.

## Field Collection and Handling
- On receipt: details logged; carcass stored at -20°C prior to examination.
- Postmortem data collected:
  - Age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, putative cause of death.
  - Additional observations: fat reserves, moult scores, hemorrhaging.
- Tissue handling:
  - Whole organs excised when possible; tissues archived in glass jars at -20°C (liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, subcutaneous fat).
- Eggs handling:
  - Measured for length, breadth, weight; contents weighed and homogenized; shell dried and weighed.
  - Shell thickness index calculated as shell weight (mg) divided by egg length (mm) times breadth (mm).

## Core Monitoring Program and Contaminants
- Core analyses carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).
- Targeted contaminants and sample types include:
  - Livers: stratified sample of sparrowhawks; livers from all herons; livers from kestrels and red kites; contents of one egg per clutch from merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle; gannet eggs biennially.
  - Eggs: contents analyzed from selected eggs (e.g., merlin, golden eagle, white-tailed sea eagle); four SGARs analyzed in livers (difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, flocoumafen).
  - Contaminants include PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, PCB-TEQs), organochlorine pesticides, mercury, and SGARs.
- Analytical workflow:
  - Methods described in referenced literature; results published in annual PBMS reports and scientific papers, plus online on PBMS website.
- Feedback to contributors:
  - Volunteers receive postmortem reports or biometric data and summarized contaminant findings to maintain engagement.

## Outputs, Dissemination, and Governance
- Findings disseminated via annual reports, scientific publications, and dedicated PBMS webpage.
- Underlying data and summaries shared with stakeholders to inform policy and management decisions.
- Outputs feed into environmental health monitoring and policy deliberations.

## Archive and Resource Potential
- PBMS frozen archive dates back to 1968.
- Current archive contents:
  - ~17,500 tissue samples from ~6,000 birds and ~9,000 egg contents.
  - 82% of tissue samples date from 1980 onward.
- Uses of archive:
  - Valuable for a broad range of environmental toxicology studies and conservation research.
  - Enables piloting and refinement of new monitoring approaches and exploration of nonchemical threats (e.g., illegal hunting, population genetics).

## Funding and Acknowledgments
- PBMS supported by funding from:
  - Centre for Ecology and Hydrology
  - Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)
  - Natural England
  - Environment Agency
  - Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use
- Acknowledges public volunteers for carcass submissions.
