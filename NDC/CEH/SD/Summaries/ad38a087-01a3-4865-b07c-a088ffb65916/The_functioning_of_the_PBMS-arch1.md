# The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme: Identifying Chemical Risks to Top Predators in Britain

- Objective and approach
  - PBMS monitors contaminant concentrations in top predators to identify chemical risks.
  - Choice of biological matrix (liver vs eggs) depends on where a compound is most toxicologically significant and on species biology.
  - Aims to inform on exposure and potential impacts across predatory birds in Britain.

- Specimens and matrices
  - Liver tissues used when toxins target liver function (e.g., SGARs) and high-affinity tissue binding sites exist.
  - Eggs used when contaminants are embryotoxins or to study rare species where carcasses are scarce.
  - Archived tissue and egg contents enable broader environmental toxicology studies beyond core monitoring.

- Sampling and collection
  - Reliance on volunteered submissions: public advertisements, taxidermists, wildlife rehabilitation centers.
  - Eligibility: freeliving prior to death or in captivity no more than 7 days; submitted via post with approved packaging.
  - Typical submissions: ~400 birds per year; autumn (Sept–Oct) and early spring (Feb–Apr) account for ~60% of submissions; predominance of juveniles.

- Postmortem examination and data recorded
  - Carcasses logged; macroscopic postmortem exam conducted to determine age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, and putative cause of death.
  - Additional observations: fat reserves, moult score, and presence of hemorrhaging.
  - Organs weighed; whole organs and tissues (liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, fat) archived at -20°C.

- Egg collection and measurement
  - Eggs come from licensed collectors as addled or deserted eggs from nests during ringing activities.
  - On receipt: measure length, breadth, weight; contents weight; assess approximate development; contents homogenised and archived at -20°C.
  - Shells rinsed, dried, weighed; shell thickness index calculated as shell weight (mg) / (length × breadth in mm).

- Core monitoring program: species, samples, and contaminants
  - Livers from a stratified sample of sparrowhawks; livers of all herons; one egg per clutch of merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle analyzed for PCBs, OC insecticides, and mercury.
  - Approximately 10 gannet eggs (Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig) analyzed for the same contaminants (coordinated biennially).
  - Livers from a stratified sample of barn owls, and livers of all kestrels and red kites analyzed for four SGARs: difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, and flocoumafen.
  - Analyses conducted by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology; methods described in related publications.

- Data dissemination and outputs
  - Results published in annual reports and scientific papers; available on a dedicated PBMS webpage.
  - Feedback to volunteers: postmortem reports (for carcasses) or biometric data and a contaminant summary for analyzed samples.

- Archive and research potential
  - PBMS frozen archive contains ~17,500 tissue samples from ~6,000 birds and ~9,000 egg contents.
  - Most tissue samples originate from 1980 onwards; the archive supports broad environmental toxicology studies and the development/testing of new monitoring approaches.
  - Archive has aided nonchemical threat research (e.g., illegal trade, genetic structure studies in golden eagles) and piloting new monitoring concepts.

- Collaboration, funding, and governance
  - PBMS is supported by funding from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England, Environment Agency, and the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use.
  - Acknowledges the public volunteers and contributors who supply carcasses and eggs.

- Accessibility and contact
  - Findings and data are accessible via annual reports, scientific papers, and the PBMS website; ongoing collaboration with data-users is a core component.
