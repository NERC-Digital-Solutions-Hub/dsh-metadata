# THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS

- Purpose and focus
  - The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) monitors contaminant concentrations primarily in liver tissues and in addled or deserted eggs.
  - Matrix choice reflects where toxicological significance is greatest for each compound or species; e.g., SGAR residues target liver, while certain contaminants are embryotoxins monitored in eggs.
  - The program aims to identify chemical risks to top predators in Britain and to support broader conservation and environmental health understanding.

- Sampling design and specimen sources
  - Carcasses are accumulated largely through public responses to advertisements; taxidermists and wildlife rehabilitation centers also contribute.
  - Collected birds must have been freeliving before death or in captivity for seven days or less.
  - Approximately 400 birds are submitted annually; submissions peak in autumn and early spring (about 60% of annual submissions in Sept–Oct and Feb–Apr).
  - The sample is heavily skewed toward juveniles (juveniles:adults ≈ 1.8:1 over the last decade).
  - On receipt, carcasses are logged and stored at -20°C until a macroscopic postmortem examination, which records age (EURING), sex, body weight, and putative cause of death, among other observations (fat reserves, moult, hemorrhaging).
  - Whole organs are excised and archived in glass at -20°C when feasible.
  - Egg collection relies on licensed collectors who submit addled or deserted eggs; eggs are measured, weighed, contents homogenized and archived at -20°C, with shell thickness indexed as shell weight/length×breadth.

- Core monitoring program and analyses
  - A subsample of archived tissues is analyzed annually:
    - Livers from a stratified sample of sparrowhawks; livers from all herons.
    - One egg from each clutch of merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle.
    - Approximately 10 gannet eggs (from Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig) analyzed biennially.
    - Livers from barn owls; livers from all kestrels and red kites.
  - Analytes include:
    - PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, and PCB TEQs)
    - Organochlorine (OC) insecticides
    - Mercury
    - SGARs (difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, flocoumafen)
  - Analyses are performed by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology using established methods described in prior publications.
  - Data are published in annual reports and scientific papers, and on the PBMS website.

- Feedback, data sharing, and value
  - Volunteer collectors receive a postmortem report or biometric data for eggs, plus a summary of contaminant levels for chemically analyzed samples.
  - The PBMS maintains a strong relationship with its volunteer base through this feedback.
  - The PBMS frozen archive (dating back to 1968) comprises about 17,500 tissue samples from 6,000 birds and 9,000 egg contents; the majority of tissue samples are from 1980 onward.
  - The archive is a valuable resource beyond the core program, enabling broader environmental toxicology studies, piloting new monitoring approaches, and projects addressing nonchemical threats (e.g., illegal trading, genetics, disease).

- Potential for broader impact and future directions
  - The archive supports retrospective analyses and development of new monitoring technologies or indicators.
  - There is an emphasis on ensuring datasets remain accessible and usable to a wider community of researchers and stakeholders beyond the PBMS outputs.

- Funding and acknowledgments
  - PBMS is supported by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England, Environment Agency, and the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use, with gratitude extended to the public contributors.
