# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2021

## Overview
- UKCEH LCM2021 is the ninth UK land cover map and consists of six datasets for Great Britain and Northern Ireland: three datasets per region at different spatial representations.
- The product is produced annually using automated methods to enable temporal monitoring and change detection.
- Formal validation reports an overall accuracy of 82.6% at full thematic detail (with 95% CI 82.19–82.99%).

## Data products and structure
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Pixel-level classifications with two bands: class (UKCEH Land Cover Class) and confidence.
  - Not generalized by the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine-scale features (e.g., narrow lines, small patches).
- Land Parcel datasets
  - Generated by intersecting 10 m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - Parcel-level attributes include:
    - gid (unique parcel id)
    - _hist (history of class frequencies as tuples)
    - _mode (dominant class)
    - _conf (mean class membership probability)
    - _stdev (std dev of conf)
    - _agg (aggregate class)
    - _n (number of 10 m pixels intersecting the parcel)
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Rasterized parcels (25 m) carrying three bands: dominant land cover (_mode), mean confidence (_conf), and purity (_purity).
- 1 km raster products
  - Summary products derived from 25 m data:
    - Dominant cover (for classes and aggregates)
    - Percentage cover (for classes and aggregates; values rounded; coastal areas may sum to <100)
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Sentinel-2 based seasonal composites (January–March, April–June, July–September, October–December) at 10 m resolution.
  - 50-band input per Classification Scene; some periods may have cloud-related gaps but overall coverage is complete.
- Context Rasters
  - 10 m context layers to improve discrimination where spectral signatures are similar.
  - GB: height, aspect, slope, distance to buildings/roads/sea/freshwater, foreshore mask, tidal water mask, woodland mask.
  - NI: height, aspect, slope, urban mask, distance to coast/freshwater/road, foreshore mask, tidal water mask.
- Classification Scenes
  - GB: 32 tiles (approx. 100 x 100 km each) used to extract 50-band Seasonal Composite Images plus Context Rasters; independently trained and classified.
  - NI: single 49-band Classification Scene using a 40-band Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite plus NI Context Rasters.
- Bootstrap Training
  - Automatic training approach using historic LCMs (2018–2020) to generate training data from parcels with high purity and consistent class across years.
  - Used to train a Random Forest classifier; sample balancing ensures rare classes are learned adequately.
- Random Forest classification
  - Ensemble learning with bootstrapped samples; outputs class membership probability per pixel.
  - Classifier and tools are implemented with bespoke UKCEH software integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL.
- Validation
  - 35,182 validation points across all 21 classes, derived from GB countryside surveys, inventory data, validation points from image interpretation and field collection.
  - Reported overall accuracy: 82.6%.

## Data production and methodology
- Seasonal imagery
  - Sentinel-2 data resampled to 10 m; four seasonal composites created to capture phenology.
  - Some gaps due to clouds, but the classifier tolerates partial spectral information.
- Contextual disambiguation
  - Context rasters reduce spectral confusion (e.g., rocks vs vegetation, coastal features).
- Classification framework
  - Bootstrap Training parcels sampled to balance RF training data.
  - Each Classification Scene classified separately to maintain regional consistency; aims to improve change detection and temporal comparability.

## Spatial framework and data management
- UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Based on LCM2007/2015 lineage; parcels represent roughly 0.5 ha minimum (MMU) and are designed to match discrete real-world land units (fields, parks, etc.).
  - Parcels help reduce noise and provide stable units for time-series analysis.
- ID changes and comparability
  - Unique identifiers (gid) differ from LCM2015; cross-year parcelId comparison by spatial overlap is not straightforward.
- Coordinate systems and extent
  - GB: British National Grid (OSGB 27700)
  - NI: Irish Grid (TM75)
  - GB extent: 0–700000 East, 0–1300000 North
  - NI extent: truncated Irish Grid to specified bounds
- File naming and dataset inventory
  - Official dataset names align with UKCEH documentation; Appendix 3 lists dataset names per region.

## Interpretation and caveats
- Class definitions and relationships
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are linked to UK BAP Broad Habitats with some nuanced differences; occasional re-interpretation is required for comparison with earlier maps.
- Thematic confusion and limitations
  - Notable spectral confusion among grasslands, bog/fen, heather, and other upland types; context rasters and seasonal information mitigate but do not eliminate confusion.
  - Saltwater vs Freshwater distinctions rely partly on coastal context rasters and can be imperfect in tidal rivers.
  - The 10 m dataset retains fine details not present in the parcel framework, which affects intercomparison with parcel-based data.
- Validation scope
  - Validation was performed on the 25 m rasterised parcel dataset; 10 m pixel product accuracy is inferred indirectly.
- Temporal aspects
  - Annual production enables disentangling random errors from real change; flicker of errors is expected in time series as the catalogue matures.

## Practical use for analysts
- Data-driven decision support
  - Use 10 m Classified Pixels for detailed habitat mapping and fine-scale feature extraction; use Land Parcel and 1 km products for change detection, aggregation, and regional reporting.
- Change detection and time-series
  - Bootstrap Training allows leveraging prior maps to generate training data for annual updates; time-series flicker of errors helps distinguish real change from noise.
- Validation awareness
  - Rely on the 25 m parcel validation for reported accuracy; be cautious when interpreting 10 m pixel details in longitudinal analyses.
- Data integration considerations
  - When comparing with LCM2015, account for changes in parcel IDs; spatial overlap-based matching is recommended for cross-year comparisons.
