# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose of Table 1: Define how broad habitats relate to LCM2000 (LCM) Target classes, Subclasses and Variants, using map display colours to show variants.
- Scope of the mapping:
  - Inshore and coastal habitats (e.g., Inshore sublittoral – Sea/Estuary; Supra-littoral rock/sediment; Supralittoral habitats).
  - Inland water and terrestrial habitats (e.g., Standing water/canals; Bogs; Dwarf shrub heath; Montane habitats; Broad-leaved woodland; Coniferous woodland; Arable & horticultural; Improved grassland; Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands; Bracken; Fen/marsh/swamp; Bog; Inland bare ground; Mountain/montane habitats; Built up areas and gardens).
  - Habitat variants (e.g., rock with algae, sand/mud with algae, saltmarsh variants, inundation states, grazed variants, dune types, etc.).
- How the mapping is used:
  - Aligns LCM2000 classifications with real-world habitat types to enable consistent reporting and monitoring.
  - Supports standardized outputs for environmental health assessments and policy performance evaluation over time.
