# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

## Overview
- Presents a crosswalk between Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) broad habitats and the CS2000 field survey classifications, including Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants (Sujclasses highlighted by map colours).
- Documents habitat-by-habitat mappings and their display in LCM2000 categories.
- Includes detailed tables comparing LCM2000 coverage with field survey estimates across the UK (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) and GB totals.
- Provides summary correspondence matrices to assess how well LCM2000 aligns with CS2000 classifications at various aggregation levels.
- Notes that coastal coverage, urban generalisation, and definitional differences affect comparisons.

## Key Tables and Contents

- Table 5: Coverage (km2) of Subclasses from Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) and Aggregate classes (bold) from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) in the UK and constituent countries
  - Breaks down major habitat groups (e.g., Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable cereals, Arable & Horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Montane, Inland bare ground, Mountain habitats, Water, Built-up areas, etc.).
  - Provides country-level totals (England, Wales, Scotland, NI) and UK totals for LCM2000 and FS where available.
  - Example patterns show large UK totals for major classes (e.g., Arable & Horticultural UK LCM2000 ≈ 57,630; Improved grassland UK LCM2000 ≈ 59,073; Built up areas & gardens UK LCM2000 ≈ 16,637), with FS figures available for some categories and not others (n/a in several rows).
  - Notes that total UK FS figures are not consistently available across all classes.

- Table 6: LCM2000 cover (km2) for BHs (uncalibrated) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and GB, compared with field survey estimates at 95% confidence (Low/High)
  - Presents per-habitat broad classes (e.g., Broad-leaved/mixed and yew woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable and horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral grassland, Calcareous grassland, Acid grassland, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Montane habitats, Inland rock, Built up areas and gardens, Supralittoral rock/sediment, Littoral rock/sediment, Oceanic seas, etc.).
  - For each class, lists LCM2000 area by country and GB, and FS Low/High estimates where available.
  - Highlights differences between LCM2000 and FS across regions (e.g., England vs. Scotland vs. NI) and notes that some FS values are not available (n/a) for certain regions.
  - Footnotes explain that LCM2000 statistics are from a full count on a 25 m grid; FS statistics from Haines-Young et al. 2000; coastal coverage variability and differences in FS population definitions affect totals.

- Table 8: Summary correspondence matrix (results expressed per 1000) comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain
  - Uses weighted estimates with strata based on 40 Land Classes and bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals.
  - Provides summary correspondences for Broad Habitats (yellow), urban-generalised areas (blue), at LCM2000 Target Class (pink) and Aggregate class levels (green).
  - Illustrates how often CS2000 classes are matched by LCM2000 classes (per 1000 units), highlighting correspondence quality across broad habitats and aggregated levels.
  - Includes footnotes detailing how correspondences were derived and the class mappings used (e.g., crosswalks between CS2000 and LCM2000 categories).

- Table 9: Summary correspondence matrix (England and Wales) – per 1000
  - Same methodology as Table 8 but focused on England and Wales, providing a regional perspective on correspondence quality.

- Table 10: Summary correspondence matrix (Scotland) – per 1000
  - Focused on Scotland, enabling regional assessment of how well LCM2000 matches CS2000 classifications.

## Methodology and Data Quality

- Data sources and basis
  - LCM2000: Land Cover Map 2000 (broad habitat categories, 25 m grid; non-calibrated cover figures in Table 6).
  - FS: Field Survey (CS2000-derived classifications) from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
- Alignment approach
  - Creation of crosswalks between LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants (Sujclasses) and CS2000 categories.
  - Aggregation of LCM2000 categories to align with CS2000 classifications for comparison.
- Uncertainty and calibration
  - Tables present confidence bounds (Table 6) for FS comparisons (Low/High) at 95% confidence.
  - Summary correspondence matrices (Tables 8–10) use weighted estimates and bootstrapping to derive confidence intervals.
- Scope and coverage considerations
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and offshore inter-tidal distinctions.
  - NI (Northern Ireland) 1 km square units are sometimes excluded from FS surveys, affecting totals.
  - Total coverage varies with the FS population definition (1 km squares) used in the analysis.
- Generalisation and urban considerations
  - Tables and footnotes discuss generalising urban areas and the impact on correspondence results.
  - Footnotes provide extensive crosswalk mappings between CS2000 and LCM2000 categories.

## Key Takeaways for Data Support and Use

- The document provides a comprehensive crosswalk between LCM2000 broad habitat classes and CS2000 field survey classifications, enabling data users to translate between map-based and field-survey-based habitat categories.
- It offers quantitative comparisons of area coverage by habitat class across the UK, including country-level and UK totals, with FS benchmarks where available.
- The summary correspondence matrices (Tables 8–10) quantify how well LCM2000 classes align with CS2000 classes, highlighting strengths and gaps in cross-class compatibility and the effects of urban generalisation.
- The accompanying footnotes explain the data sources, methods (25 m grid counting, bootstrapping), and caveats (coastal variability, FS population definitions), which are essential for interpreting the results and for data quality assessment.
- For data support purposes, the tables serve as:
  - Crosswalks to convert between LCM2000 and CS2000 classifications.
  - Baselines for evaluating map accuracy and for planning enhancements to habitat mapping or subsequent data products.
  - Reference points for regional (England, Wales, Scotland, NI) and GB-wide analyses, including uncertainty estimates.
