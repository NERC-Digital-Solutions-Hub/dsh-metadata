# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents how Broad Habitats map onto LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants (Suclasses), with Suclasses shown in map display colours.
  - Aids GIS users in translating field or map classifications into the standardized LCM2000 scheme.

- What the tables cover (highlights of content)
  - Inshore sublittoral, Standing water/canals, Littoral rock, Supra-littoral rock and sediment, Inland habitats (woodlands, arable land, grasslands, urban areas, etc.), and various coastal and marine classifications.
  - For each Broad Habitat, lists: LCM Target Class, LCM Subclasses, and Variants.

- How this relates to data products and GIS work
  - Enables consistent symbolization and cross-walking between different classification schemes for map visualizations.
  - Provides a reference for data cleaning and transformation when combining datasets with different legends.

- Appraisal of table structure for GIS workflows
  - Helps in designing map symbology by aligning display colours with Suclasses.
  - Facilitates interoperability between LCM2000 and CS2000/field-survey datasets when performing accuracy assessments or cross-legacy comparisons.

- Endnotes and methodological cues from the surrounding tables (contextual relevance)
  - The broader document includes detailed breakdowns (Tables 5–10) of Area cover (km2), uncalibrated LCM2000 vs field survey (FS) estimates, and summary correspondence matrices.
  - Footnotes indicate that LCM2000 statistics come from a 25 m grid, FS statistics from Haines-Young et al. 2000, and that differences arise from definitional and methodological variations (e.g., coastal/intertidal inclusions, urban generalisation).

- Relevance to GIS data challenges (from the document’s broader context)
  - Illustrates the complexity of cross-walking multiple land-cover/habitat classifications for map products.
  - Highlights considerations when aggregating across national datasets ( England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) and when comparing to field survey data.
