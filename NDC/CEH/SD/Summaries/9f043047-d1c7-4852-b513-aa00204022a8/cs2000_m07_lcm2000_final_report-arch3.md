# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Maps Broad Habitats to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants (with Suclasses shown by map colours) to enable consistent classification across datasets.
- Examples include associations such as:
  - Inshore sublittoral: Sea / Estuary (Target class) and Sea / Estuary (Subclass); Variants = sea.
  - Standing water/canals: Water (inland); Variants = water (inland).
  - Littoral rock/sediment, Supra-littoral rock/sediment, Bogs, Dwarf shrub heath, Arable & horticultural, Improved grassland, etc., each linked to corresponding LCM2000 classes and variants.
- The table provides a comprehensive crosswalk across habitat types used in policy monitoring and environmental health assessment.

## What the Tables Show

- Table 5: Coverage (km2) of Subclasses from Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) and Aggregate classes from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) in the UK and constituent countries.
  - Provides detailed area figures by habitat, country, and aggregated groupings (e.g., Broad-leaved woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable cereals, Improved grassland, etc.).
  - Includes UK totals for LCM2000 and FS, with country-level breakdowns (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland).
  - Highlights differences between LCM2000 estimates and field survey totals (FS), including where data exist or are missing.

- Table 6: LCM2000 cover (km2) for Broad Habitats (uncalibrated) vs field survey estimates at 95% confidence (±2 standard errors).
  - Compares LCM2000 estimates with FS Low and FS High across major habitat groups (e.g., Broadleaved woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing water, Rivers, Montane habitats, Inland rock, Built up areas, Supralittoral rock, Littoral rock, Sediments, etc.).
  - Displays UK-wide totals and per-country values (England, Wales, Scotland, NI).
  - Demonstrates calibration potential: notable differences indicate where calibration or refinement may be needed (e.g., Improved grassland, Arable & horticulture, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands).

- Footnotes for Tables 5 and 6
  - LCM2000 statistics come from a full count of cover on a 25 m grid; FS statistics from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS explained in the text.
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and offshore inclusion; FS population definitions affect totals.

- Tables 8–10: Summary correspondence matrices (LCM2000 vs CS2000 field survey)
  - Present correspondences per 1000 for Broad Habitats, Target Class, and Aggregate class levels.
  - Tables cover cross-walking between CS2000 (field survey) and LCM2000, including urban generalisation considerations.
  - Show detailed cross-tabulations for various habitat groupings (Broadleaved/mixed/yew woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing water and rivers, Montane habitats, Inland rock, Built up areas/gardens, Supralittoral rock, Littoral sediment, Littoral rock, Oceanic seas, etc.).
  - Indicate the level of correspondence and where urban generalisation or BHlevel (habitat level) analyses apply.

- Table 9 and Table 10 (England & Wales; Scotland) similarly present targeted correspondences and calibration insights across CS2000 and LCM2000 subsets, including per-habitat and per-class level comparisons.

- General interpretation of the correspondence data
  - Provides a basis for calibrating LCM2000 against field survey data (CS2000).
  - Highlights where LCM2000 aligns well with field data and where discrepancies exist, informing monitoring framework adjustments and uncertainty characterization.

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks

- Crosswalks enable interoperability
  - The mapping between LCM2000 and CS2000 allows monitoring frameworks to harmonise data across datasets and jurisdictions, supporting policy evaluation and trend analysis.

- Calibration and validation
  - The uncalibrated LCM2000 vs FS comparisons (Table 6) illustrate the need for calibration when using remote-sensed land-cover maps as a basis for environmental health indicators and policy evaluation.

- Uncertainty and confidence
  - The inclusion of 95% confidence intervals in FS estimates provides a basis for expressing uncertainty in monitoring outputs and for setting confidence-based decision thresholds.

- Urban generalisation and habitat aggregation
  - The correspondence matrices show how urban areas and broader habitat aggregates affect classifications, informing decisions on data aggregation levels and the design of monitoring dashboards.

- Metadata and data governance considerations
  - The document underscores challenges commonly faced by monitoring-framework authors:
    - Data availability, quality, and metadata completeness.
    - Access to data and timeliness.
    - Silos within and between organisations.
    - Requirements to publicly share datasets.
    - Keeping data up to date and implementing robust data governance.

## Implications and Recommendations for Authors of Monitoring Frameworks

- Use the LCM2000-CS2000 crosswalks to align datasets before integration, ensuring consistent target classes, subclasses, and variants across sources.
- Plan calibration steps when employing LCM-based maps for policy evaluation; incorporate field-survey benchmarks (CS2000) and document uncertainties (as illustrated by the 95% CIs in Table 6).
- Promote data openness and governance by sharing underlying datasets where possible, while maintaining appropriate data quality and provenance.
- Address metadata gaps to facilitate verification and re-use by others; where metadata is inadequate, contact data originators to fill gaps.
- Where silos exist, implement data governance processes and cross-agency collaboration to improve data access and integration.
- Use the calibration results to inform monitoring design, including:
  - Defining target accuracy levels for key habitats.
  - Determining which habitat classes require more frequent validation or higher-resolution data.
  - Designing dashboards and reports that transparently communicate uncertainties.

## Bottom-line

- The document provides a comprehensive crosswalk between LCM2000 habitat classifications and CS2000 field data, including extensive coverage statistics, calibration comparisons with confidence intervals, and detailed correspondences across multiple classification levels. For authors of monitoring frameworks, these resources are essential for harmonising data, validating remote-sensing products against field data, quantifying uncertainty, and guiding data governance and open-data practices to support robust environmental health policy evaluation.
