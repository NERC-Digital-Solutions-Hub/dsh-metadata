# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Purpose of the document
  - Defines how Broad Habitats map to LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants (Suclasses) and provides detailed tabular mappings and resulting coverage statistics.

- Data sources and classifications
  - LCM2000: Land Cover Map 2000 (full count of cover on a 25 m grid).
  - FS/CS2000: Field survey data used for validation and comparison with LCM2000; CS2000 refers to field survey squares; FS denotes field survey statistics.
  - Footnotes explain differences between LCM2000 and field surveys, and note variability in coastal coverage and totals depending on population definitions.

- What Tables 5–6 and 8–10 cover (high-level)
  - Table 5: Coverage (km2) by Subclasses from LCM2000 and by Aggregate classes (bold) from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) across the UK and its constituent countries.
    - Provides UK and country totals for major habitat classes (e.g., broad-leaved woodland, coniferous woodland, arable & horticulture, improved grassland, etc.).
    - Highlights large discrepancies between LCM2000 and FS/field survey totals and gaps where FS data are unavailable.
  - Table 6: LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) for Broad Habitats (BHs) by region, with 95% confidence intervals from field survey estimates (Low/High).
    - Includes categories such as broadleaved woodland, coniferous woodland, arable & horticulture, improved grassland, neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Montane habitats, inland rock, built-up areas, supralittoral rock, littoral rock, littoral sediment, oceanic seas, etc.
    - Shows UK-wide totals and regional variations; FS confidence intervals indicate calibration needs.
  - Tables 8–10: Summary correspondence matrices
    - Present results expressed per 1000 (or per 1000s) comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain and England & Wales (and cross-tabulations by target class and aggregate levels).
    - Use bootstrapped confidence intervals to indicate uncertainty and generalisation to urban areas.
    - Show correspondences across target classes, broad habitats, and aggregated classes, with some placeholders for missing data.
  
- Data quality, interpretation, and limitations
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS/CS2000 are explained in the text; correspondences are not perfectly one-to-one.
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and offshore inter-tidal area inclusion/exclusion.
  - Total coverage depends on how FS squares are defined; some Northern Ireland BHs may be excluded from survey.
  - Some FS data are not available for certain regions or classes; calibration results are context-dependent.
  - The tables present uncalibrated (Table 6) and calibrated-style comparisons (Tables 8–10) with varying levels of confidence.

- Practical implications for Data Leaders
  - Metadata and provenance are critical: clearly define LCM2000, CS2000, and FS equivalents, including how totals are defined and what is included in coastal zones.
  - Validation and calibration: use Table 6 and the bootstrap-based correspondence tables (Tables 8–10) to assess where LCM2000 aligns with field survey data and where adjustments are needed.
  - Data interoperability: harmonize target classes, subclasses, and variants across datasets to enable robust cross-border comparisons.
  - Gap identification: Table 5 and the regional breakdowns help identify under-represented habitats or where field data are lacking.
  - Governance and updates: track data lineage, update frequencies, and document reasons for any discrepancies between map-based data and field surveys.
  - User-centricity: provide clear, understandable correspondences to support policy colleagues and other stakeholders who rely on data products, enabling co-ownership and iterative product improvements.
