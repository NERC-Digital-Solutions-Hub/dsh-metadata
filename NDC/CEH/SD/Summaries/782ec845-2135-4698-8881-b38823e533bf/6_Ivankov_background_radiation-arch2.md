# Metadata for 6_Ivankov_background_radiation.csv

- Overview
  - Metadata for a dataset on Ivankov background radiation, including sampling site locations, height-specific ambient dose rates, and habitat context.
  - Designed to support environmental monitoring and subsequent analysis of radiation exposure in the environment.

- Data structure and fields
  - latitude and longitude: Location of sampling sites, in decimal degrees.
  - Units/Methodology for latitude/longitude: n/a (values are decimal degrees).
  - Notes for latitude/longitude: GPS receiver is a Garmin GPSmap 78S using the WGS-84 system, with accuracy of 10 m or less.
  - Analysis_type_1_or_2: Indicates study scope per site.
  - Units/Methodology for Analysis_type_1_or_2: n/a.
  - Notes for Analysis_type_1_or_2: n/a.
  - at_0.1m: Ambient equivalent dose rate measured at 0.1 m above ground.
  - Units/Methodology for at_0.1m: n/a; measurements taken with certified gamma-beta irradiation dosimeters (RKS-01, Stora-TU, Ukraine).
  - Notes for at_0.1m: n/a.
  - at_1m: Ambient equivalent dose rate measured at 1 m above ground.
  - Units/Methodology for at_1m: n/a; measurements taken with certified gamma-beta irradiation dosimeters (RKS-01, Stora-TU, Ukraine).
  - Notes for at_1m: n/a.
  - Sampling_site_description: Habitat type at each site.
  - Units/Methodology for Sampling_site_description: n/a.
  - Notes for Sampling_site_description: Seven sites were inaccessible; locations are retained for completeness.

- Measurement details
  - Height-specific dose rates: 0.1 m and 1 m above ground surface.
  - Instrumentation: RKS-01 dosimeters (gamma-beta irradiation) from Stora-TU, Ukraine.

- Site accessibility and data completeness
  - Acknowledgement that seven monitoring sites were inaccessible.
  - Location coordinates maintained in the dataset to preserve geographic context.

- Data quality, provenance, and use
  - Coordinate data provided with a known accuracy (≤10 m) and a clearly stated GPS source.
  - Analysis_type_1_or_2 clarifies whether sites include soil sampling in addition to dose measurements.
  - Metadata supports standardized reporting of ambient dose rates for environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
