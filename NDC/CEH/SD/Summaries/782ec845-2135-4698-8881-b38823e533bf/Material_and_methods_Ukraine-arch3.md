# Spatial datasets of radionuclide contamination in the Ukrainian Chernobyl Exclusion Zone

## Purpose and scope
- Provides comprehensive soil- and particle-focused measurements of radionuclide contamination in the Ukrainian Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ).
- Covers multiple campaigns and data streams to map contamination, including fuel particle context, depth profiles, and region-wide surveys.
- Supports environmental monitoring, risk assessment, and decision-making related to remediation, land use, and long-term radiological management.

## Sampling and site coverage
- Soil sampling across roughly 1200 sites within a 36 km radius of the ChNPP (July 1995–September 1997).
- Site selection used a grid with ~1.2 km spacing; closer sampling (100–500 m) in western narrow trace areas with high dose gradients.
- Predominantly helicopter-based sampling; vehicles used for forest areas.
- For each point, a composite soil sample (five 37 mm cores, 2–30 cm depth) was collected, mass not less than 2 kg.
- GPS coordinates determined with ScoutMaster (WGS-84); reported accuracy ~100 m, with a ~300 m systematic deviation.

## Measurements and analytical methods

### Soil activity measurements
- Samples dried, sieved to 1 mm, homogenized; four sub-samples for radionuclide analysis.
- Gamma-emitting radionuclides measured by high-purity germanium detectors (HPGe) in Marinelli geometry; calibration with mixed standard activity.
- Sub-sample differences checked; aggregation performed to ensure representative analysis.
- 90Sr determined radiochemically via dissolution, separation, and measurement after equilibrium with 90Y.
- Quality control includes extended counting times for low-activity samples to achieve <30% error at 95% confidence.

### Agrochemical and soil typing data
- Standard soil properties measured: humus (organic matter), pH (H2O and KCl), hydrolytic acidity, exchangeable Ca, K, P.
- Soil typing coded using USSR classifications and FAO/UNESCO system; table mappings provided for descriptive context.
- Some samples (around village Bober area) lack complete agrochemical data other than pH.

### Plutonium isotope measurements
- Pu isotopes analyzed in 82 samples along main release traces; sample processed after heating and dissolution, followed by radiochemical separation and alpha counting (with tracers for chemical yield).
- Additional 12 samples collected in 2000 from distances up to ~200 km beyond CEZ; Pu-isotope methodology identical.

### Pu isotope measurements by depth
- Eight sites with cores sectioned into depth intervals (0–2, 2–4, 4–6, … up to 30 cm) for Pu, 137Cs, and 90Sr.
- One site deeper (up to 110 cm) with 10 cm slices analyzed for 238Pu, 239,240Pu, 137Cs, and 90Sr.

### Hot particles
- Historical sampling (1980s–1990s) identified and isolated thousands of hot particles (fuel particles and ruthenium-rich condensed particles).
- Particle analysis included gamma, alpha, and beta measurements; fuel particles showed enrichment in actinides with burn-up values (MWd/kg) noted.
- Additional particles sourced from Poland and other European sites included for comparison.
- Burn-up estimates and annealing duration of selected particles discussed to infer release mechanisms.

### Estimation of remaining fraction of fuel particles
- In 0–30 cm soil, remaining fuel particle fraction estimated via exchangeable 90Sr leaching (85Sr/Y yield tracking) and a derived fraction DFP representing undissolved fuel particles.
- For soils where 90Sr:154Eu indicate limited exchangeable 90Sr, total 90Sr content used for DFP estimation.
- Caveats noted: some negative values (set to zero) due to measurement uncertainty; leaching behavior dependent on soil type (e.g., sandy soils with low humus).

## Ivankiv region survey (2014)
- 3,389 sampling points on a 1 km grid with GPS-determined coordinates (accuracy ≤10 m).
- Dose rate measurements at 1 m and 0.1 m heights; dosimetry devices with background corrections (cosmic and instrument background subtracted).
- 547 soil samples collected (0–20 cm envelope method); 90Sr analysis by 90Y equilibrium; gamma analyses for other radionuclides.
- Natural radionuclides measured (40K, 226Ra, 232Th) with reported mean activities; dose rates correlated with 137Cs but with wide scatter.
- Quality assurance aligned with ISO/IEC 17025 standards.

## Data types and radionuclides
- Radionuclides documented include 90Sr, 137Cs, 154Eu, 241Am, 85Sr, 40K, 226Ra, and 232Th; select Pu isotopes (238Pu, 239,240Pu) and uranium-related fuel indicators.
- Depth-resolved data available for Pu and key fission products.
- Fuel particle burn-up data available for contextual interpretation of measured activities.
- Soil types and classifications linked to soil chemistry indicators.

## Data quality, limitations, and governance
- GPS coordinates carry notable uncertainty (≈100 m real-world, with systemic bias up to ~300 m for some datasets).
- Some samples show incomplete agrochemical data or negative values due to analytical uncertainty (interpreted as zero in usage).
- Underestimation risks acknowledged for certain fuel particle methods (e.g., 90Sr extraction efficiency and particle dissolution).
- Multiple datasets employ standardized sampling envelopes and QA practices; Ivankov region adheres to formal QA (ISO/IEC 17025) for legal/technical credibility.
- Data integration across campaigns and regions supports cross-site comparisons but requires careful harmonization of methodologies and units.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Comprehensive, multi-nuclide, and depth-resolved datasets enable detailed mapping of CEZ contamination and fuel-particle behavior.
- Longitudinal depth profiles and hot-particle characterizations enhance understanding of mobility, weathering, and potential remobilization risks.
- Structured sampling schemes (grid-based, envelope sampling, and depth slices) support standardization and comparability across sites and over time.
- Detailed metadata on sampling protocols, measurement methods, and soil typing aids data governance, reproducibility, and data sharing.
- The Ivankiv 2014 dataset demonstrates scalable survey approaches for regional monitoring with rigorous QA, useful for informing policy decisions and land-management guidance.
