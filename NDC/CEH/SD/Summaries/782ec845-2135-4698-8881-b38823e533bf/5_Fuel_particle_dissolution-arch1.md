# Column heading explanations for 5_Fuel_particle_dissolution.csv

- Purpose
  - Defines the meaning, units, and notes for each column in the 5_Fuel_particle_dissolution.csv dataset.
  - Helps ensure consistent data interpretation, quality assurance, and downstream analysis.

- Column-by-column summary
  - Code
    - Explanation: Database serial number – unique ID.
    - Units: n/a
    - Notes: .
  - Identifier
    - Explanation: UIAR unique label – chemical analysis number.
    - Units: .
    - Notes: If the number is the same (e.g., 1a, 1b), samples were from the same site.
  - Date_of_90Sr_measurement
    - Explanation: Date of measurement.
    - Units: n/a
    - Notes: Format is dd-mmm-yy.
  - 90Sr_exchangeable_form_in_soil_%
    - Explanation: Percentage of 90Sr present in soil in an exchangeable form.
    - Units: percentage
    - Notes: .
  - Relative_uncertainty_of_90Sr_exchangeable_form_portion_in_soil_%
    - Explanation: Relative uncertainty of the 90Sr exchangeable form portion (95% confidence interval).
    - Units: percentage
    - Notes: .
  - 85Sr_exchangeable_form_in_soil_%
    - Explanation: Percentage of 85Sr present in soil in an exchangeable form.
    - Units: percentage
    - Notes: .
  - Relative_uncertainty_of_85Sr_exchangeable_form_portion_in_soil_%
    - Explanation: Relative uncertainty of the 85Sr exchangeable form portion (95% confidence interval).
    - Units: percentage
    - Notes: .
  - 90Sr_activity_in_the_FP-associated_form_%
    - Explanation: 90Sr activity in the fuel-particle (FP) associated form.
    - Units: .
    - Notes: May contain negative values; these arise from a low exchangeable fraction and high error. Users should treat these values as zero.
  - Relative_uncertainty_of_90Sr_activity_in_the_FP-associated_form_%
    - Explanation: Relative uncertainty of the 90Sr activity in the FP-associated form (95% confidence interval).
    - Units: percentage
    - Notes: .

- Data quality and interpretation notes
  - Some fields have no units (n/a for Code, Date, etc.) or blank notes.
  - Measurement date uses a standard dd-mmm-yy format.
  - Sample grouping can be inferred by identical identifiers, indicating samples from the same site.
  - Negative values in 90Sr_activity_in_the_FP-associated_form_% may occur and should be treated as zero in analyses.
