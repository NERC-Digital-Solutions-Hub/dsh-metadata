# Mapping the contamination of Ivankiv district territory with radionuclides Final report November 2013- September 2014 on the studies carried out by UIAR within the frameworks of contract No.2013-04 from 19/11/2013, 2014.

## Overview
- Presents data collection and measurements for mapping radionuclide contamination in the Ivankiv district.
- Part of UIAR studies under contract No.2013-04 (final report covering 2013–2014).

## Data collected and sampling details
- Full_weight_kg: Total weight of soil samples.
- Sample_weight_kg: Weight of sample used for activity measurement.
- Sampling method: Composite samples created from 5 sub-samples taken with a 37 mm corer to a depth of at least 20 cm.

## Variables and units (radionuclide activity and contamination metrics)
- 137Cs_Bq_kg: Activity concentration of cesium-137 in Bq/kg.
- 90Sr_Bq_kg: Activity concentration of strontium-90 in Bq/kg.
- 40K_Bq_kg: Activity concentration of potassium-40 in Bq/kg.
- 226Ra_Bq_kg: Activity concentration of radium-226 in Bq/kg.
- 232Th_Bq_kg: Activity concentration of thorium-232 in Bq/kg.
- 137Cs_kBq_m2: Contamination density of cesium-137 in kBq/m².
- 90Sr_kBq_m2: Contamination density of strontium-90 in kBq/m².
- Relative_uncertainty_*_%, 95% CI: Relative uncertainty of each determination at 95% confidence interval.
- Ratio_Cs:Sr: Cesium to strontium ratio, with 95% confidence interval (values not specified in the excerpt).
- Notes: Fields exist but many are blank; some values may be reported as "<" to indicate below the minimum detectable activity.

## Data quality and interpretation
- Uncertainties are provided at 95% confidence, supporting assessment of measurement reliability.
- Some measurements may be reported as below the minimum detectable activity (MDA) indicated by "<" values.
- Metadata on data quality is embedded (uncertainties, detection limits, and presence of blanks), though some fields are not populated in this extract.
