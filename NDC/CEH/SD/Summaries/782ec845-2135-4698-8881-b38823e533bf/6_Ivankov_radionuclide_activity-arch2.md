# Mapping the contamination of Ivankiv district territory with radionuclides Final report November 2013- September 2014 on the studies carried out by UIAR within the frameworks of contract No.2013-04 from 19/11/2013, 2014.

## Purpose and scope
- Provide a data-driven, consistent format to monitor environmental contamination by radionuclides in Ivankiv district.
- Enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time through standardized outputs.

## Data and key variables
- Full_weight_kg: total weight of soil samples; composite sample consists of 5 samples taken with a 37 mm corer to a depth of at least 20 cm.
- Sample_weight_kg: weight of the sample used for activity measurements.
- 137Cs_Bq_kg: activity concentration of Cesium-137 (Bq per kg).
- Relative_uncertainty_137Cs_%: relative uncertainty of 137Cs determination at 95% confidence interval.
- Fraction_90Sr_recovered: fraction of Strontium-90 recovered during analysis.
- Relative_uncertainty_90Sr_recovery_%: relative uncertainty of 90Sr recovery at 95% CI.
- 90Sr_Bq_kg: activity concentration of Strontium-90 (Bq per kg); values below minimum detectable activity are indicated with "<".
- Relative_uncertainty_90Sr_%: relative uncertainty of 90Sr determination at 95% CI.
- 40K_Bq_kg: activity concentration of Potassium-40 (Bq per kg); values below minimum detectable activity are indicated with "<".
- Relative_uncertainty_40K_%: relative uncertainty of 40K determination at 95% CI.
- 226Ra_Bq_kg: activity concentration of Radium-226 (Bq per kg); 95% CI provided for uncertainty.
- Relative_uncertainty_226Ra_%: relative uncertainty of 226Ra determination at 95% CI.
- 232Th_Bq_kg: activity concentration of Thorium-232 (Bq per kg); < indicates below minimum detectable activity; 95% CI provided for uncertainty.
- Relative_uncertainty_232Th_%: relative uncertainty of 232Th determination at 95% CI.
- 137Cs_kBq_m2: density of Cesium-137 contamination (kBq per square metre); 95% CI provided.
- 90Sr_kBq_m2: density of Strontium-90 contamination (kBq per square metre); < indicates below minimum detectable activity; 95% CI provided.
- Relative_uncertainty_137Cs_kBq_m2_%: relative uncertainty of 137Cs density per area at 95% CI.
- Relative_uncertainty_90Sr_kBq_m2_%: relative uncertainty of 90Sr density per area at 95% CI.
- Ratio_Cs:Sr:  Cs to Sr ratio (95% CI provided); sometimes not available (n/a).

## Methodology and outputs
- Sampling and measurements:
  - Composite soil samples collected as described above.
  - Data reported as activity concentrations (Bq/kg) and surface densities (kBq/m2).
  - Cs:Sr ratio reported where available.
- Data quality and uncertainty:
  - All concentration and density values accompanied by relative uncertainty at 95% confidence.
  - Some measurements flagged as below detection limit (indicated by "<" values).
- Data management:
  - Emphasis on storing datasets and uploading to appropriate data portals for accessibility.
