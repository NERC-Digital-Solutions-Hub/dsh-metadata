# Column heading explanations for 5_Fuel_particle_dissolution.csv

- Overview
  - This document provides definitions and metadata for the column headings in the dataset 5_Fuel_particle_dissolution.csv, which relates to measurements of 90Sr and related forms in soil associated with fuel particle dissolution (referencing Chernobyl studies).
  - Fields cover identifiers, measurement dates, fractionation of radionuclides (exchangeable forms for 90Sr and 85Sr), and FP-associated activity, along with their uncertainties.

- Key columns and meanings
  - Code
    - Explanation: Database serial number – a unique ID.
    - Units: n/a
    - Notes: .
  - Identifier
    - Explanation: UIAR unique label – chemical analysis number.
    - Notes: If the same number appears (e.g., 1a, 1b), samples come from the same site.
    - Units/Notes: .
  - Date_of_90Sr_measurement
    - Explanation: Date of measurement.
    - Format: dd-mmm-yy
    - Units: n/a
    - Notes: .
  - 90Sr_exchangeable_form_in_soil_%
    - Explanation: Percentage of 90Sr present in soil in an exchangeable form.
    - Units: percentage
    - Notes: .
  - Relative_uncertainty_of_90Sr_exchangeable_form_portion_in_soil_%
    - Explanation: Relative uncertainty of the determination (at 95% confidence interval) for the 90Sr exchangeable portion.
    - Units: percentage
    - Notes: .
  - 85Sr_exchangeable_form_in_soil_%
    - Explanation: Percentage of 85Sr present in soil in an exchangeable form.
    - Units: percentage
    - Notes: .
  - Relative_uncertainty_of_85Sr_exchangeable_form_portion_in_soil_%
    - Explanation: Relative uncertainty of the determination (at 95% confidence interval) for the 85Sr exchangeable portion.
    - Units: percentage
    - Notes: .
  - 90Sr_activity_in_the_FP-associated_form_%
    - Explanation: Percentage activity of 90Sr in the fuel-particle (FP) associated form.
    - Units: (not explicitly stated)
    - Notes: May contain negative values; these result from a low exchangeable fraction and high error. Users should treat these values as zero.
  - Relative_uncertainty_of_90Sr_activity_in_the_FP-associated_form_%
    - Explanation: Relative uncertainty of the determination (at 95% confidence interval) for the FP-associated 90Sr activity.
    - Units: percentage
    - Notes: .

- Data quality and preparation notes (relevant to GIS workflows)
  - Sample grouping: The Identifier indicates samples from the same site (useful for spatial clustering and site-level mapping).
  - Uncertainty handling: Several fields include 95% confidence interval uncertainties; consider these when creating thematic layers or choropleth maps.
  - Negative FP-associated activity: Some FP-associated 90Sr activity values may be negative; policy from the notes suggests treating these as zero in GIS analyses.
  - Data completeness: Units are specified for some fields (percentages) but not for others; ensure consistent unit interpretation when visualizing.
  - Data integration: Data may come from multiple samples/sites with variable resolutions; plan data cleaning and standardization before GIS joining or layering.
  - Data provenance: References indicate the scientific basis (kinetics of fuel particle weathering and 90Sr mobility in Chernobyl contexts), supporting interpretation of the measurements.

- GIS relevance and usage suggestions
  - Mapping opportunities:
    - Create maps of 90Sr exchangeable_form_in_soil_% and 85Sr_exchangeable_form_in_soil_% to show radionuclide speciation across sites.
    - Map FP-associated 90Sr activity and its uncertainty to depict contaminant forms linked to fuel particles.
    - Use Date_of_90Sr_measurement to develop time-enabled (temporal) maps if multiple dates exist.
  - Data join strategies:
    - Use Identifier to join measurements to site polygons or point locations.
    - Consider filtering by measurement date or by uncertainty thresholds for clearer visualizations.
  - Interpretation cautions:
    - Take uncertainties (95% CI) into account when classifying or classing values into categories.
    - Treat negative FP-associated 90Sr activity values as zero in spatial analyses per data notes.
