# Column heading explanations for 5_Fuel_particle_dissolution.csv

- Purpose: Define the meaning, units, and notes for each column in the dataset "5_Fuel_particle_dissolution.csv," which contains radiochemical measurements related to fuel particle dissolution and the mobility of 90Sr/85Sr in soil.
- Data structure overview:
  - Code, Explanation: Database serial number (unique ID) with human-readable explanation.
  - Code, Units: Instance indicating units (often not applicable, n/a).
  - Code, Notes: Additional notes for the column (often empty).
  - Identifier: UIAR unique label; samples with the same identifier (e.g., 1a, 1b) come from the same site.
  - Date_of_90Sr_measurement: Date of measurement in dd-mmm-yy format.
- Key measurement fields (percentages and uncertainties):
  - 90Sr_exchangeable_form_in_soil_%: Percentage of 90Sr present in an exchangeable form in soil.
  - Relative_uncertainty_of_90Sr_exchangeable_form_portion_in_soil_%: 95% confidence interval relative uncertainty for the exchangeable portion.
  - 85Sr_exchangeable_form_in_soil_%: Percentage of 85Sr in exchangeable form in soil.
  - Relative_uncertainty_of_85Sr_exchangeable_form_portion_in_soil_%: 95% CI relative uncertainty for the 85Sr exchangeable portion.
  - 90Sr_activity_in_the_FP-associated_form_%: Percentage activity of 90Sr in the fuel particle (FP)-associated form (may be empty in units; values may be reported as percentages).
  - Relative_uncertainty_of_90Sr_activity_in_the_FP-associated_form_%: 95% CI relative uncertainty for the FP-associated 90Sr activity.
- Data interpretation notes:
  - May contain negative values for 90Sr activity in the FP-associated form due to a low exchangeable fraction combined with high error; users should treat these values as zero.
- Data quality and metadata considerations:
  - Uncertainties are provided and should be incorporated into analyses.
  - Date format and sample identifiers support traceability and cross-referencing with other datasets.
  - Many “Notes” fields are empty, indicating potential areas for enhanced metadata documentation.

- Practical takeaway for data governance:
  - The document provides essential metadata to support data discovery, interpretation, and quality assessment for studies on radiochemical soil contamination and fuel particle weathering.
  - Ensure proper handling of uncertainty, standardized date formats, and clear linkage of sample identifiers to collection sites.
