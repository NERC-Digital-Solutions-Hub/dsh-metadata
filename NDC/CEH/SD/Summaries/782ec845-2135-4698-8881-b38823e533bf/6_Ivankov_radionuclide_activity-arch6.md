# Mapping the contamination of Ivankiv district territory with radionuclides Final report November 2013- September 2014 on the studies carried out by UIAR within the frameworks of contract No.2013-04 from 19/11/2013, 2014.

## Summary
- Describes soil radioactivity measurements used to map contamination in Ivankiv district, including radionuclide activity concentrations in soil and surface densities.
- Data are based on composite soil samples (5 samples via 37 mm corer, depth >= 20 cm) and include both weights and activity measurements.
- Includes 137Cs, 90Sr, 40K, 226Ra, 232Th concentrations, plus Cs:Sr ratio, and associated uncertainties.

## Data content and structure
- Sample metadata and measurements:
  - Full_weight_kg: total weight of soil samples (composite sample description provided).
  - Sample_weight_kg: weight of sample used for activity measurement.
- Activity concentrations (per mass or area):
  - 137Cs_Bq_kg, 90Sr_Bq_kg, 40K_Bq_kg, 226Ra_Bq_kg, 232Th_Bq_kg: activity concentration in becquerels per kilogram.
  - 137Cs_kBq_m2, 90Sr_kBq_m2: surface density of contamination (kilobecquerels per square metre).
- Uncertainty and data quality:
  - Relative_uncertainty_137Cs_% (and similarly for 90Sr, 40K, 226Ra, 232Th): relative uncertainty of determination at 95% confidence interval.
  - Relative_uncertainty_?_% fields provided for each metric (where applicable).
  - Relative_uncertainty_137Cs_kBq_m2, etc.: relative uncertainty for density measurements (95% CI).
- Recovery and detection limits:
  - Fraction_90Sr_recovered: fraction of Sr-90 recovered (with associated relative uncertainty Relative_uncertainty_90Sr_recovery_%).
  - Some values for 90Sr_Bq_kg and 40K_Bq_kg, 226Ra_Bq_kg, 232Th_Bq_kg may be reported with "<" indicating below minimum detectable activity (MDA).
- Ratios:
  - Ratio_Cs:Sr (Caesium to Strontium ratio) with 95% confidence interval.
- Notes:
  - Notes fields explain composite sampling details and detectability; several notes indicate when values are below MDA or provide methodological clarifications.

## Data quality and interpretation
- Some measurements are reported as below the minimum detectable activity (indicated by "<" values for certain nuclides and densities).
- 95% confidence interval uncertainties are provided for several activity concentrations and densities.
- Fraction recovered is reported for 90Sr, with an associated uncertainty.
- Notes clarify sampling methodology and provide context for interpretation of the data.

## Methodology and provenance
- Sampling: composite soil samples created from 5 subsamples using a 37 mm corer, collected from a depth of at least 20 cm.
- Measured radionuclides: Cs-137, Sr-90, K-40, Ra-226, Th-232 (and derived Cs:Sr ratio).
- Units: activity in Bq/kg or kBq/m2; weights in kg; uncertainties in percent.
- Reference framework: Kashparov et al. Mapping the contamination of Ivankiv district territory with radionuclides; Final report for UIAR, contracted under No.2013-04 (Nov 2013–Sep 2014).

## Usage and potential data products
- Suitable for creating contamination maps, dashboards, and comparison charts by nuclide, by sampling location, or by depth.
- Supports risk assessment and communication to stakeholders and the public.
- Data can feed self-service analytics and dashboards showing activity concentrations, surface densities, and Cs:Sr ratios with associated uncertainties.
- May require handling non-detects (MDA) and recovery fraction in analyses or visualizations.
