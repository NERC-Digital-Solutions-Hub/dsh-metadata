# Spatial datasets of radionuclide contamination in the Ukrainian Chernobyl Exclusion Zone

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides spatial datasets of radionuclide contamination in the Ukrainian CCHN Exclusion Zone (CEZ)
  - Covers multiple radionuclides (e.g., 90Sr, 137Cs, 154Eu, 238Pu, 239+240Pu, 241Am, 40K, 226Ra, 232Th) and fuel-particle related metrics
  - Data gathered from soil sampling and analyses between 1995 and 2014, including depth profiles and hot particle analyses
  - Includes data from the Ukrainian CEZ and comparative data from areas outside CEZ (e.g., Poland)
  - Aims to support consistent environmental health monitoring and policy-relevant analyses; enables data integration and reuse

- Study area and sampling design
  - Around 1,200 soil sampling sites within a 36 km radius of ChNPP (Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant)
  - Sampling grid with approximately 1.2 km spacing; denser 100–500 m spacing in the western narrow trace of fallout
  - Predominant use of helicopter for rapid site-to-site movement; motor vehicles for forest sampling
  - Sampling sites selected on a 100 m × 100 m homogeneous basis; GPS coordinates (WGS-84) collected
  - Accuracy of GPS coordinates ~100 m with a systematic deviation ~300 m
  - Composite soil samples (envelope method): five sub-samples (cores 37 mm diameter) from corners and center over 2–5 m2 to 30 cm depth; total mass ≥ 2 kg
  - Depth rationale: 30 cm chosen as ~95% of 90Sr activity is in the upper 10–20 cm after ~10 years; depth testing via 90Sr:154Eu ratios to identify leaching or particle migration
  - Additional soil sampling around villages (e.g., Bober) and soils with high deposition values outside the CEZ boundary noted

- Soil activity measurements and laboratory procedures
  - Samples dried, sieved to <1 mm, homogenized; four sub-samples used for radionuclide determinations
  - Gamma-emitting radionuclides measured in three 100 cm3 and one 1000 cm3 replicates using gamma spectrometry
  - Gamma spectrometry specifics:
    - HPGe detectors (~30% relative efficiency; ~1.90 keV FWHM at 1333 keV)
    - 1 L Marinelli geometry; efficiency calibration with multi-radionuclide spike
    - Typical counting time ~1 hour; longer as needed for low activity samples
  - Quality control: sub-sample measurements compared; bulked and remixed if variability (>0.15) observed; re-analysis until <0.15 difference
  - Determination of 90Sr via radiochemical method with 6M HNO3 digestion, followed by separation and beta counting
  - Data quality: use of established protocols and QA criteria; acknowledgment of potential underestimation for certain particles

- Determination of main agrochemical characteristics
  - Standard methods used for humus (organic matter), pH(H2O and KCl), hydrolytic acidity, exchangeable Ca, and exchangeable K and P
  - Mechanical soil texture not reported directly; soils classified per USSR and FAO/UNESCO systems (Tables and codes provided)
  - Some sites (codes 116–143) around Bober had limited agrochemical measurements (except pH)

- Pu isotopes measurements
  - 82 samples from sites along primary fallout traces analyzed for Pu isotopes
  - Procedure: homogenized 100 cm3 sample, digestion in 6M HNO3, radiochemical Pu separation using ion exchange, plating onto stainless steel, alpha counting
  - Chemical yield tracked with 236Pu or 242Pu tracers
  - Additional 12 samples collected in autumn 2000 and analyzed by same method; sampling up to 200 km outside CEZ
  - Depth profiling for Pu isotopes conducted at eight sites (0–2, 2–4, 4–6, 6–8, 8–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, 25–30 cm)
  - One site extended to 110 cm depth (2001) with 10 cm slices; analyses for 238Pu, 239,240Pu, 137Cs, and 90Sr

- Pu-containing hot particles
  - Large initial fuel particles (2–3 μm) with narrower deposition west of ChNPP and larger fragments deposited within 2–5 km
  - Regular sampling network established in 1987; >1,200 large (>,10 μm) hot particles identified and isolated from 30 km zone
  - Within inner CEZ, majority of particles were finely dispersed fuel particles; some condensed particles containing ruthenium
  - Particle analyses included gamma and alpha spectrometry, with radiochemical separation for 90Sr
  - Additional hot particles from the Chernobyl Shelter (1992) also analyzed
  - Burn-up values (fraction of fissioned fuel) reported for particles >10 μm; CEZ particles generally reflect younger fuel burn-up (9.8–11 MWd/kg) vs initial estimate (14 MWd/kg)
  - Comparative datasets include NE Poland and other European particle studies; particle groups (A/B/C) in Poland
  - Data include particle-specific activities and isotopic compositions to inform source-term and particle weathering studies

- Estimation of remaining fraction of fuel particles in soils
  - Fraction of exchangeable 90Sr used to infer undissolved fuel particles via 85Sr tracer experiments
  - Sampling: 3–4 sub-samples per 0–30 cm soil; 5 mL of 85Sr tracer; 6–48 days post-spiking, 2 M NH4Ac extraction
  - Calculation of leached fractions for 85Sr and 90Sr (soluble vs residue) and derived fraction of undissolved fuel particles (DFP)
  - For samples with low 90Sr:154Eu ratio, total 90Sr content used to assess DFP due to preferential leaching in sandy soils
  - Handling of negative values in data: treated as zero in analyses

- Ivankov region survey (2014)
  - 3,389 sampling points identified on a 1 km grid over Ivankiv region and 3 km surrounding area
  - GPS coordinates (accuracy ≤10 m) collected; 1 m and 0.1 m height dose-rate measurements at 1 km intervals using gamma-beta dosimeters
  - Several inaccessible sites noted; background estimated using a frozen body for correction
  - 547 soil samples collected; envelope method used for representative sampling (down to ≥20 cm)
  - 90Sr measured via dissolution and radiochemical separation; gamma analyses for 40K, 226Ra, 232Th, and 137Cs
  - Natural radionuclide concentrations reported (40K, 226Ra, 232Th) and compared to global baselines
  - 137Cs and 90Sr activity ranges reported (e.g., 137Cs 6–390 Bq kg−1; 90Sr 1–160 Bq kg−1 dry matter); 137Cs:90Sr ratio higher to the east
  - Dose rates at 1 m across Ivankiv: 0.1–0.24 μSv h−1; background and cosmic contributions discussed
  - Dose rate data used to explore relationships with 137Cs soil concentrations and natural background levels

  - Use of standardized sample processing, calibration, and measurement protocols to ensure comparability
  - Spatial coordinates and depth-resolved data enable mapping and modeling of radionuclide distributions
