# Spatial datasets of radionuclide contamination in the Ukrainian Chernobyl Exclusion Zone

- Purpose and scope
  - Comprehensive dataset documenting radionuclide contamination in the Ukrainian Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), focusing on spatial distribution, particle forms, and depth profiles to support ecological and environmental analysis.
  - Covers multiple components: soil activity (gamma emitters and strontium), plutonium isotopes, hot particles, soil chemistry, and regional surveys.

- Sampling and site selection (soil sampling)
  - About 1,200 sampling sites within a 36 km radius of ChNPP (Jul 1995–Sep 1997); grid-based approach with ~1.2 km spacing; Western narrow trace sampled more densely (100–500 m) due to steep gradients.
  - Sampling logistics: mostly helicopter-based for rapid site-to-site movement; forest sampling via motor vehicles.
  - At each site, absorbed dose rate measured at 1 m height; site homogeneity checked with DRG-01T dosimeter.

- Composite sampling method
  - Envelope method: five 37 mm cores (corners and center) over 2–30 cm depth; total mass >= 2 kg.
  - Depth reason: 30 cm chosen since ~95% of 90Sr activity is in upper 10–20 cm after 10 years; tested using vertical 90Sr distributions and 90Sr:154Eu ratios.
  - GPS coordinates recorded with ScoutMaster (WGS-84); accuracy ~100 m (systematic deviation ~300 m).

- Soil processing and gamma/chemical analyses
  - Soil samples dried, sieved (1 mm), homogenized; four sub-samples per sample for radionuclide analyses:
    - Three of 100 cm3 and one of 1000 cm3 for gamma-emitting nuclides in Marinelli containers.
    - Gamma spectra via HPGe detectors; routine calibration with mixed radionuclide spike.
  - Quality control: sub-samples re-bulked/remixed if 137Cs variances exceeded 0.15; repeat analyses ensured representativity.
  - 90Sr determination: radiochemical method with dissolution, digestion, and 90Sr/90Y equilibrium; 90Sr activity measured by low-background beta counting after separation.

- Agrochemical and soil type data
  - Agrochemical properties measured by standard methods: humus (organic matter), pH (H2O and KCl), hydrolytic acidity, exchangeable Ca, K, P.
  - Mechanical soil texture data recorded (clay/silt/sand) and mapped to USSR classification codes and FAO/UNESCO system (Table 2 in dataset).
  - Some sites (codes 116–143 near Bober) were outside the CEZ; only pH measured there; no agrochemical data.

- Pu isotope measurements (primary isotope data)
  - 82 samples along main contamination traces analyzed for Pu isotopes:
    - Sample prep: 100 cm3 homogenized, digested in 6 M HNO3 after drying; Pu separated by ion-exchange, deposited for alpha counting.
    - Tracers: 236Pu or 242Pu used to determine chemical yield.
    - Detection: alpha spectrometry (Soloist system) after electrodeposition.
  - Additional 12 samples collected in autumn 2000, analyzed with identical methodology (sampling distances up to ~200 km from CEZ).

- Pu isotope measurements at different depths
  - Depth profiling at eight sites: cores sectioned into 0–2, 2–4, 4–6, 6–8, 8–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, 25–30 cm; analysed for Pu isotopes, 137Cs, and 90Sr.
  - One site extended to 110 cm depth in 2001 with 10 cm slices; depth samples analysed for 238Pu, 239,240Pu, 137Cs, 90Sr.

- Hot particles and particle characterization
  - Background: early explosion produced numerous uranium dioxide fuel particles (median radius ~2–3 μm) deposited up to ~100 km west; larger fragments deposited within 2–5 km.
  - Long-running sampling network (1987–1989) identified >1,200 large ( >10 μm) hot particles within inner CEZ; later additions (~500 more) from 1989–1996.
  - Particle types: predominantly fuel particles (95+% in inner CEZ) and a minority of condensed particles (Ru-rich).
  - Particle analysis methods: gamma, alpha, beta spectrometry; neutron activation, electron probe microanalysis, and laser mass spectrometry to confirm fuel composition and burn-up.
  - Burn-up data indicate younger fuel in CEZ particles; comparisons with particles from other areas (Poland, Sweden, Hungary) provide context.
  - Additional particle datasets include 294 particles from inside the Shelter (1992) for comprehensive characterization.
  - Data include burn-up and effective formation/annealing parameters derived from 90Sr and 137Cs activities.

- Soil sampling and preparation (additional CEZ datasets)
  - 115 soil samples (Jul 1995–May 1997) across CEZ, focusing on variability in fuel particle characteristics.
  - Sampling along western trace and other areas (southern and northern traces) with soddy podzolic sandy soils; additional peat soil samples within 300 m where possible.
  - Two cores per site: 0–5 cm (for pH) and 0–30 cm (for Sr isotopes and gamma analyses).
  - 0–30 cm samples used to estimate remaining undissolved fuel particle fraction via Sr exchangeability methods.

- Estimation of remaining fraction of fuel particles
  - Fraction of exchangeable 90Sr determined using 2 M NH4OAc extraction with 85Sr tracer to estimate the fraction of undissolved fuel particles (DFP).
  - For samples with low 90Sr:154Eu ratios (migration of leached 90Sr), total 90Sr content used to assess undissolved fuel fraction.
  - Calculations incorporate dissolution/leaching behavior and distribution of activity among exchangeable vs. residue fractions.
  - Negative data points (artefacts of low exchangeable 90Sr) treated as zero for practical use.

- Representative activity data and burn-up context
  - Table 3 (in dataset) provides radionuclide activity concentrations in ChNPP Unit 4 fuel at different burn-ups (e.g., 90Sr, 90Sr ratios, 137Cs, 154Eu, 155Eu, 154Eu, etc.).
  - Burn-up context informs the relative activity of particles deposited in CEZ versus original reactor fuel.

- Ivankov region survey (regional dose and soil data)
  - 2014 survey over Ivankov region and surrounding 3 km, grid-based sampling (1 km spacing); 3,389 points identified.
  - GPS coordinates with high accuracy (≤10 m); ambient dose rate measured at 1 m and 0.1 m heights at 1 km intervals using certified dosimeters; rapid 20 s measurements per site.
  - Backgrounds and cosmic contributions accounted for; zero-background calibration performed using a frozen lake site.
  - 547 soil samples processed via envelope method to ≥20 cm depth; 90Sr analyzed via 90Y equilibrium; gamma analyses conducted; QA aligned with ISO/IEC 17025.
  - Natural radionuclides measured: 40K, 226Ra, 232Th, in addition to artificial 137Cs and 90Sr; mean activity concentrations reported (e.g., 40K ~140 Bq/kg, 226Ra ~12 Bq/kg, 232Th ~10 Bq/kg).
  - Dose rates (1 m height) ranged 0.1–0.24 μSv/h; East areas showed higher 137Cs and 90Sr; 137Cs:90Sr ratio increased with distance from ChNPP.

- Data quality, standardization, and accessibility
  - Methods emphasize traceability, QA, and cross-dataset comparability (gamma spectrometry, radiochemical separations, depth profiling, and standardized sample preparation).
  - Extensive references and methodological standards cited (ISO/IEC 17025, ISO 18589-5:2009, GOST standards, nondestructive and radiochemical techniques).
  - Datasets compiled with metadata on sampling design, depths, soil types, and particle classifications to enable data discovery and reuse.

- Overall implications for data-driven analyses
  - Rich, multi-dimensional dataset enabling analysis of spatial patterns, depth-dependent radionuclide distributions, fuel particle behavior, and regional dose assessment.
  - Supports correlations between soil properties, particle type (fuel vs condensed), burn-up, depth, and radionuclide mobility (e.g., Sr leaching) across CEZ and adjacent regions.
  - Facilitates modeling of contamination spread, particle weathering, and long-term ecological/radiological risk assessments.
