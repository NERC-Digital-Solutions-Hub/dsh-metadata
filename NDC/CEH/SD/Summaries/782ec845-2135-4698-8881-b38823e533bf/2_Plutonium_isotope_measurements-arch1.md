# Column heading explanations for 2_Plutonium_isotope_measurements.csv

- Overview
  - Describes each column in the 2_Plutonium_isotope_measurements.csv dataset, including names, expected units, and notes on data provenance and measurement methods.

- Columns and explanations
  - Code
    - Explanation: Database serial number - unique ID.
    - Units: n/a.
  - Date_of_Pu_measurement
    - Explanation: Date of measurement (long date format).
    - Units: n/a (date).
  - Terrestrial_density_of_soil_contamination_with_238Pu_kBq_m-2
    - Explanation: 238Pu contamination in soil expressed on an aerial basis.
    - Units: kilo bequerels per square metre (kBq m-2).
    - Notes: For determination of plutonium radioisotopes at a given site, one of the homogenized 100 cm3 samples was used. After heating at 450 °C overnight, samples were boiled for 4 hours in 6 M HNO3. Plutonium radionuclides were extracted by a standard radiochemical method (Pavlotskaya, 1997). Activities on the plates were measured using a Soloist alpha-spectrometer with a Soloist-U0300 detector (EG&G ORTEC, USA).
  - Relative_uncertainty_238Pu_%
    - Explanation: Relative uncertainty of determination (at 95% confidence interval).
    - Units: percentage (%).
    - Notes: .
  - Terrestrial_density_of_soil_contamination_with_239_240Pu_kBq_m-2
    - Explanation: 239,240Pu contamination in soil expressed on an aerial basis.
    - Units: kilo bequerels per square metre (kBq m-2).
    - Notes: For determination of plutonium radioisotopes at a given site, one of the homogenized 100 cm3 samples was used.

- Measurement methodology (as described in notes)
  - Sample: homogenized 100 cm3 sample used per site measurement.
  - Preparation: heated to 450 °C overnight; digested in 6 M HNO3.
  - Analysis: radiochemical separation of plutonium radionuclides (Pavlotskaya, 1997).
  - Instrumentation: Soloist alpha-spectrometer with Soloist-U0300 detector (EG&G ORTEC, USA).

- Data provenance and context
  - The dataset entries reflect terrestrial soil contamination levels of 238Pu and 239,240Pu with associated uncertainties, measured by established radiochemical and alpha-spectrometric methods.
