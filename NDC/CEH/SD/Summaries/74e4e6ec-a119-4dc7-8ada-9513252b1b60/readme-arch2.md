# Flood maps for the Central Highlands of Vietnam and surrounding Provinces

- Purpose and scope: flood depth maps to support planning and policy decisions, including SDG-related planning; covers 11 provinces in the Central Highlands and surrounding areas.
- Geographic coverage: Binh Dinh, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, Khanh Hoa, Kon Tum, Lam Dong, Ninh Thuan, Phu Yen, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai.
- Spatial and temporal detail: 30 m horizontal grid spacing; 10 design flood return periods (1 in 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 200, 250, 500, 1000 year).
- Flood types provided: fluvial undefended (FUD), fluvial defended (FD), and pluvial (P). FUD lacks defences; FD adjusts conveyance for estimated defence standards; validation suggests limited difference between FD and FUD in these regions due to data and assumptions. Pluvial maps are harder to validate due to short-duration events.
- Model and updates: generated with an updated Fathom 3.0 global flood model, incorporating:
  - improved river channel conveyance capacity (Neal et al., 2021)
  - improved design flood estimation (Zhao et al., 2021)
  - FABDEM 30 m elevation dataset (Hawker et al., 2022)
  - validation against satellite imagery and household surveys (Hawker et al., in prep)
- Data content and structure:
  - 330 GeoTIFF files plus 1 readme
  - per province: 30 maps (10 for each flood type)
  - file naming convention: Province_FloodType_ReturnPeriod.tif
  - examples: Quang_Ngai_FD_1in20.tif
  - FloodType shorthands: FUD (fluvial undefended), FD (fluvial defended), P (pluvial)
  - Return periods are labeled as 1in5, 1in10, 1in20, 1in50, 1in75, 1in100, 1in200, 1in250, 1in500, 1in1000
- Data use and interpretation:
  - depth values are in metres; 0 = 0 m flood depth (consider reclassifying 0 as NoData for visualization)
  - recommended visualization in GIS (QGIS/ArcMap); more advanced spatial/statistical analysis in R or Python
  - assists surface water and river flood risk assessment for planners and policymakers
- Analytical considerations for monitoring teams:
  - enables comparison with flood observations (satellite data, photos, reports) and calculation of skill scores (critical success index, hit rate, false alarm ratio, bias)
  - useful for cross-referencing with other datasets to enhance data value and accessibility
- Quality control and limitations:
  - model validation reported against satellite observations and household surveys; in-press article comparing Fathom 3.0 to Fathom 2.0
  - does not explicitly model flood defences not visible in the 30 m FABDEM data; differences between FD and FUD may be small due to defence standard estimation
- Access and data management:
  - designed for storage and upload to appropriate data portals; intended to support transparency and reuse by other organisations
