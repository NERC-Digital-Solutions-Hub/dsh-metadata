# Supporting Information: Details of measurements conducted in the Beas River

## Overview
- Describes methods and instruments used to measure cross-sectional depth profiles and flow velocity along the Beas River.
- Ten cross-section measurements were taken along straight, stable-channel segments without islands or midchannel structures.
- All measurements and calculations are reported in SI units (depth, channel width in metres; velocity in m/s; discharge in m^3/s).

## Instrumentation and data collection
- Depth: handheld acoustic depth meter (Hondex PS-7, 200 kHz) with 9V DC battery.
- Flow velocity: cup-type water current meter (Roorkee Industries, India) with a digital recorder providing direct velocity indication.
- Mass adder: 10 kg fish weight mounted on a calibrated rod.
- Support: 10 m suspension cable.
- Positioning: handheld GPS (Garmin etrex 10) for coordinates of all measurement points.
- Channel width: laser range finder (Bushnell Sport 850, 4x, 20 mm) to mark distances from left to right bank.
- Pre-survey calibration: current meter precalibrated at source with supplier-provided rating chart.

## Procedure
- Measurements taken along ten cross-sections in straight, stable-channel reaches, lacking islands or midchannel structures.
- At each cross-section, record water depth, flow velocity, and bank-to-bank width.
- Discharge estimated directly from measured depth and velocity; width used for sectional description.

## Calculations and modelling
- Direct discharge: computed from depth and velocity measurements at each cross-section (units: m, m/s, resulting in m^3/s).
- Manning’s equation: used to estimate discharge at each cross-section.
  - Slope values obtained from a digital elevation model (ASTER 30 m DEM) and cross-checked with published information (Vercruysse & Grabowski 2021).
  - Alluvial roughness coefficient 'n' derived from published guides (Arcement & Schneider 1989) and calibrated against direct discharge measurements.
- Calibration: 'n' values refined to align Manning-based estimates with measured discharges.

## Data and data management
- All data organized and uploaded into a dataset with structured sheets:
  - Location of cross-sections
  - Cross-section depth profiles
  - Cross-section discharge details
  - Manning’s equation parameters
  - Metadata
