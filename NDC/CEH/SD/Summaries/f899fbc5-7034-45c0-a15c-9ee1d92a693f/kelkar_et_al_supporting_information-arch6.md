# Supporting Information: Details of measurements conducted in the Beas River

- Objective: Measure cross-sectional depth profiles and flow velocity to estimate discharge (directly and via Manning's equation), calibrate roughness, and create a structured dataset for further analysis.

- Equipment used:
  - Handheld acoustic depth meter: Hondex PS-7 portable depth sounder (200 kHz) with 9 V DC battery
  - Cup-type water current meter (Roorkee Industries, India) with digital recorder for direct velocity indication
  - 10 kg fish weight mounted on a calibrated rod with 10 m suspension cable
  - Handheld GPS: Garmin etrex 10 for coordinates of measurement points
  - Laser range finder: Bushnell Sport 850 for measuring channel width (distance between banks)

- Field measurements and sampling design:
  - Ten cross-sections measured along river channels with stable banks and straight, linear channels without islands or midchannel structures
  - Depth and flow velocity measured at each cross-section
  - Channel width determined from left bank to right bank using laser range finder
  - All measurements recorded in SI units: depth and distances in metres, velocity in m/s
  - Discharge calculated in cubic metres per second (m^3/s)

- Data processing and calculations:
  - Manning's equation used to estimate discharge at each cross-section
  - Slope values obtained from a digital elevation model (ASTER 30 m DEM) and cross-validated with published information
  - Alluvial roughness coefficient ('n') values sourced from published guides (Arcement & Schneider 1989) and calibrated from direct discharge measurements
  - Direct discharge measurements (from depth and velocity data) used to confirm/adjust 'n' values

- Data organization and availability:
  - Data compiled into a dataset uploaded with structured sheets:
    - Location of cross-sections
    - Cross-section depth profiles
    - Cross-section discharge details
    - Manning's equation parameters
    - Metadata

- Quality assurance and calibration:
  - Current meter precalibrated at source; rating chart provided by supplier
  - Calibration and confirmation of Manning's n values based on direct discharge measurements
