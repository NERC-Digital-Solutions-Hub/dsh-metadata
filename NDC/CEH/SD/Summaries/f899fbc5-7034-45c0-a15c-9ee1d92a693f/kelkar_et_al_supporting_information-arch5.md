# Supporting Information: Details of measurements conducted in the Beas River

## Overview
- Documentation of measurements for cross-sectional depth profiles and flow velocity along Beas River.
- Ten cross-sections measured along stable, straight, bank-fixed channels (no islands or midchannel structures).

## Instruments and equipment
- Depth: Hondex PS-7 portable acoustic depth sounder (200 kHz) with 9 V DC battery.
- Velocity: Cup-type water current meter (Roorkee Industries, India) with a digital recorder for direct velocity indication.
- Mass/offset: 10 kg fish weight mounted on a calibrated rod with a 10 m suspension cable.
- Positioning: GPS unit (Garmin etrex 10) to record coordinates of measurement points.
- Channel width: Laser range finder (Bushnell Sport 850, 4x, 20 mm) to measure distance from left to right bank.

## Data collection and units
- All measurements recorded in SI units:
  - Water depth and bank distances in metres.
  - Flow velocity in metres per second (m/s).
  - Discharge calculated in cubic metres per second (m³/s).
- Data are tabulated in the dataset with sheets for:
  - Location of cross-sections
  - Cross-section depth profiles
  - Cross-section discharge details
  - Manning's equation parameters
  - Metadata

## Calculations and parameters
- Discharge estimation at each cross-section using measured depth and velocity.
- Manning’s equation applied for discharge estimation:
  - Slope values derived from a digital elevation model (ASTER 30 m DEM) and verified against published data (Vercruysse & Grabowski 2021).
  - Alluvial roughness coefficient 'n' values taken from published guides (Arcement & Schneider 1989).
  - 'n' values calibrated using direct discharge measurements from the collected depth and velocity data.

## Data governance, provenance, and quality
- Directly calibrated equipment values provided by suppliers; pre-calibrated instruments used at source.
- Metadata included to document measurement conditions and parameters for reproducibility.
- Data uploaded to a dataset with structured sheets to support discovery, reuse, and appropriate data governance.

## Data availability and documentation
- The dataset is organized and documented with explicit sheets for key components:
  - Location of cross-sections
  - Cross-section depth profiles
  - Cross-section discharge details
  - Manning's equation parameters
  - Metadata
