# Supporting Information: Details of measurements conducted in the Beas River

## Objective
- Measure cross-sectional depth profiles and flow velocity at ten cross-sections along the Beas River.
- Select cross-sections in straight, stable-bank channels without islands or mid-channel structures to ensure consistent geometry.

## Instruments and Measurements
- Handheld acoustic depth meter (Hondex PS-7, 200 kHz) with a 9V DC battery for depth readings.
- Cup-type water current meter (Roorkee Industries, India) with a digital recorder for direct velocity indication.
- 10 kg fish weight mounted on a calibrated rod with a 10 m suspension cable to aid velocity measurements.
- Precalibrated current meter; supplier-provided rating chart used for calibration.
- GPS (Garmin etrex 10) to record coordinates of all measurement points.
- Laser range finder (Bushnell Sport 850, 4x, 20 mm) to mark channel width (distance from left bank to right bank).

## Data and Units
- All measurements recorded in SI units: depth and channel width in meters; flow velocity in m/s.
- Discharge calculated in m^3/s from depth and velocity data.

## Hydraulics and Calculations
- Discharge estimated at each cross-section using Manning's equation.
- Slope values derived from a digital elevation model (ASTER 30 m DEM) and validated with published information.
- Alluvial roughness coefficient ('n') values sourced from published guides (Arcement & Schneider 1989) and calibrated against direct discharge measurements.

## Data Organization and GIS Readiness
- Dataset uploaded and structured into sheets:
  - Location of cross-sections
  - Cross-section depth profiles
  - Cross-section discharge details
  - Manning's equation parameters
  - Metadata
- Data format and coordinates suitable for integration into GIS workflows for mapping and hydraulic modeling.

## Data Quality and Calibration
- Direct discharge measurements used to calibrate Manning's n values.
- Instrument precalibration and supplier rating charts employed to ensure measurement accuracy.
