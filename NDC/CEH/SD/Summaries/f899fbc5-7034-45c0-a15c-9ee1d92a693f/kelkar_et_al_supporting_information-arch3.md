# Supporting Information: Details of measurements conducted in the Beas River

## Objective
- To measure cross-sectional depth profiles and flow velocity in order to compute river discharge and support environmental monitoring and framework development.

## Instrumentation and measurement protocol
- Depth and flow velocity:
  - Handheld acoustic depth meter: Hondex PS-7 portable depth sounder (200 kHz).
  - Cup-type water current meter (Roorkee Industries, India) with a digital recorder for direct velocity indication.
  - 10 kg fish weight mounted on a calibrated rod with a 10 m suspension cable.
- Positioning and measuring:
  - Handheld GPS unit (Garmin etrex 10) to record coordinates of all measurement points.
  - Laser range finder (Bushnell Sport 850) to mark channel width (left bank to right bank distances) during measurements.
- Calibration and data integrity:
  - Current meter precalibrated at the source; supplier-provided rating chart used.
  - All measurements recorded in SI units: depth, bank distances in metres; flow velocity in m/s; discharge in m^3/s.

## Study design and cross-section selection
- Ten cross-sections measured along river channels with:
  - Stable banks.
  - Straight, linear channels.
  - No islands or mid-channel structures.

## Calculations and modeling
- Discharge estimation:
  - Calculated from measured depth and flow velocity.
  - Manning’s equation used to estimate discharge at each cross-section.
- Input parameters:
  - Slope values from a digital elevation model (ASTER 30 m DEM) and verified with published information (Vercruysse & Grabowski 2021).
  - Alluvial roughness coefficient 'n' values sourced from published guides (Arcement & Schneider 1989).
  - 'n' values calibrated against direct discharge measurements (derived from depth and velocity).
- Data processing:
  - Consistent use of SI units throughout calculations.

## Data management and structure
- Dataset organization:
  - Sheets include: Location of cross-sections; Cross-section depth profiles; Cross-section discharge details; Manning's equation parameters; Metadata.
- Metadata and transparency:
  - Detailed metadata included to enable verification and reuse.
  - Data prepared for sharing and interoperability.
