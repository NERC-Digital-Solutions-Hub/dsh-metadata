# Supporting Information: Details of measurements conducted in the Beas River

## Objective
- Document measurements of cross-sectional depth profiles and flow velocity to estimate river discharge.
- Provide a reproducible methodology for environmental monitoring.

## Instruments and measurement protocol
- Depth: handheld acoustic depth meter (Hondex PS-7, 200 kHz) operated with a 9V DC battery.
- Velocity: cup-type water current meter (Roorkee Industries, India) with a digital recorder for direct velocity indication.
- Mass reference: 10 kg fish weight mounted on a calibrated rod with a 10 m suspension cable.
- Positioning: handheld GPS (Garmin etrex 10) to record coordinates of each measurement point.
- Channel width: laser range finder (Bushnell Sport 850) to mark left-to-right bank distances.
- Survey conditions: ten cross-sections along river channels with stable banks and straight, linear channels without islands or midchannel structures.
- Units: all measurements in SI units (meters for depth and distances, m/s for velocity).

## Measurements and data collection details
- Ten cross-sections measured to capture depth and velocity profiles.
- Discharge calculated in cubic meters per second (m^3/s) from measured readings.
- Data are organized and stored in a dataset with sheets for:
  - Location of cross-sections
  - Cross-section depth profiles
  - Cross-section discharge details
  - Manning's equation parameters
  - Metadata

## Calculations and modelling
- Discharge estimation:
  - Direct calculation from measured depth and velocity.
  - Manning’s equation used at each cross-section for discharge estimation.
- Slope inputs: derived from a digital elevation model (ASTER 30 m DEM) and cross-checked with published information (Vercruysse & Grabowski 2021).
- Roughness: alluvial roughness coefficient ('n') values taken from published guides (Arcement & Schneider 1989) and calibrated using direct discharge measurements.

## Data management and quality assurance
- All data are tabulated and stored in a structured dataset with clear parameter sheets and metadata to ensure traceability and reproducibility.
- Precalibration:
  - Current meter precalibrated at the source; rating chart provided by the supplier.
- Calibration:
  - 'n' values calibrated against direct discharge measurements to improve Manning-based estimates.
