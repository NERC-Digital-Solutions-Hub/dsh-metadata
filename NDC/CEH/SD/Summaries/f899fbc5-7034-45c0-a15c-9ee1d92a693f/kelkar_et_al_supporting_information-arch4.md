# Supporting Information: Details of measurements conducted in the Beas River

## Objective and scope
- Document the methodology for measuring cross-sectional depth profiles and flow velocity along ten cross-sections of the Beas River.
- Ensure measurements are taken in channels with stable banks, straight, linear channels, and no mid-channel structures.

## Instruments and measurement setup
- Handheld acoustic depth meter: Hondex PS-7, 200 kHz beam, powered by a 9V DC battery.
- Cup-type water current meter (Roorkee Industries, India) with a digital recorder for direct velocity indication.
- 10 kg fish weight mounted on a calibrated rod, with a 10 m suspension cable for measurements.
- Current meter precalibrated at the source; rating chart provided by the supplier.
- Handheld GPS unit: Garmin etrex 10 for recording measurement coordinates.
- Laser range finder: Bushnell Sport 850 (4x, 20 mm) to mark left-to-right bank distances (channel width).
- All measurements recorded in SI units (depth, bank distances in metres; flow velocity in m/s).
- Discharge calculated from depth and velocity measurements.

## Data collection protocol
- Ten cross-sections surveyed along the river.
- Measurements aligned with stable banks and straight-channel sections without islands or mid-channel structures.
- Data used to compute discharge (m^3/s) and support subsequent analyses.

## Data processing and modelling
- Discharge estimated at each cross-section using Manning's equation.
- Slope derived from a digital elevation model (ASTER 30 m DEM) and cross-validated with published information (Vercruysse & Grabowski 2021).
- Alluvial roughness coefficient ('n') values sourced from published guides (Arcement & Schneider 1989) and calibrated against direct discharge measurements.
- Calibration and confirmation of 'n' values performed using direct discharge measurements from measured flow depth and velocity.

## Data organization and metadata
- Data compiled into a dataset uploaded with structured sheets:
  - Location of cross-sections
  - Cross-section depth profiles
  - Cross-section discharge details
  - Manning's equation parameters
  - Metadata
