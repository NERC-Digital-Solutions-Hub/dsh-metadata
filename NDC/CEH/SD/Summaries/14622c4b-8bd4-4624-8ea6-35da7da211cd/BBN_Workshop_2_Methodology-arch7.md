# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015

- This report documents the methodology and outputs from ACES: LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE, focusing on the development of Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future rural land use change in Mozambique through participatory workshops.
- Lead and partners: University of Edinburgh (lead), with Universidad Mondlane, IIED, and others; funded by ESPA (NERC, ESRC, DfID).
- Primary aim: construct participatory BBNs to explore how deforestation affects rural well-being; qualitative data from 20 workshops are included.

Overview of data and outputs

- Data structure
  - The database comprises seven .rtf files reporting results from 20 workshops:
    - BBN_Workshop_1_NationalMaputo_2014.rtf (Maputo workshop results)
    - BBN_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf (Xai Xai workshop results)
    - BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf
    - BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf
    - BBN_Workshops_Village_2014_Mabalane.rtf
    - BBN_Workshops_Village_2015_Marrupa.rtf
  - Uncompressed file sizes are provided for each file.
- Quality control
  - Data collected via notes by 1–3 people, some discussions recorded with participant consent, photos of materials.
  - Two researchers drafted results; a second reviewer who attended the workshops conducted a final review and approved the documents as official results.
- Development and implementation
  - Methodology built by the research team, drawing on references, to construct causal diagrams linking land use change and rural well-being.
  - Workshops included representatives from Niassa (Lichinga) and Zambezia (Quelimane) provinces.
  - Workshops conducted on specific dates: Lichinga (04/08/2015) and Quelimane (28/10/2015).

Objectives and outputs of the workshops

- 1.1 Objective of the workshop
  - Capture factors influencing rural well-being and their relationships with ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
  - Gather ideas on actions that could contribute to poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
  - Maximize variable coverage initially, then refine to the most important variables.
  - Collect stakeholder input to build a relevant and representative BBN for Marrupa district and to understand how interventions might influence land use change.
- 1.2 Output
  - Three causal diagrams per working group, on large format (2x3 meters) paper, including variables and connections (no quantitative data yet).
  - A table relating interventions to land use categories, indicating probable impacts.
  - A record of workshop discussions to reflect stakeholder concerns and perspectives.
- 1.3 Methodology and agenda
  - Timeline: Pilot workshop in Edinburgh (29 June), prep in Maputo (25 July), pilot in Maputo (27 July), then provincial workshops with two days each (scenarios first day, BBN second day).
  - Participants were divided into three groups to ensure broad representation.
  - Most sessions were audio-recorded; some groups declined recording.
  - To reduce novelty, “causal diagrams” terms were used instead of “BBN.”
  - Agenda highlights include sessions on spatial data effects on scenarios and land use change in 2035, and hands-on group work to build causal diagrams.

Workshop methodology and activities

- Core focus
  - Ecosystem services and well-being: participants examined how wellbeing components relate to ecosystem services and land use.
  - Group work centered on main productive activities: subsistence agriculture, tobacco farming, and charcoal production, identified as key drivers of woodland loss and land use change.
  - Participants selected the top wellbeing components (initial votes, then group consensus), linked these to ecosystem services, and connected activities to land use changes.
  - The process culminated in proposing actions to improve activity performance and mitigate land use change impacts.
- Session on effects of interventions on land use change
  - Three groups selected six interventions from prior exercises.
  - Each group estimated the effect of interventions on land use change (percent change) using a matrix on A0 paper across land use categories.
  - Groups presented their diagrams and discussed the resulting land use changes.
  - Concluding session included a summary of workshop findings and a brief introduction to the basic BBN structure.

Output details by workshop location

- Lichinga Workshop (4–5 August 2015)
  - Participating institutions include UP-Niassa, ORAM-Niassa, U.C.A. Lichinga, UN Lúrio, We Effect, DPA-Niassa, SDPI-Marrupa, Eco Turismo, SPGC-Niassa, WWF Niassa, Fundação Malonda, ITC Niassa, and others.
- Quelimane Workshop (28–29 October 2015)
  - Participating institutions include DP Ciência e Tecnologia Zambézia, Escola Superior de Ciências Marinhas e Costeiras/UEM, ITC-Zambézia, DPA-SPFFB, AMASA, FONGA, SDAE-Gurué, Hoyo-Hoyo, Instituto Médio Agro-Pecuário de Gurué, SDPI-Gurué, FREPOG, UNIZAMBEZE, UT-REDD+, SPP-DPAZ, APAMAZ, ORAM Zambézia, DPTADR-Zambézia, A. Politécnica, IIAM Zambezia, DPRME-Zambézia, DPEF-Economia e Finanças.

Relevance for GIS and map-based data products

- Outputs produced as large-format visual diagrams (2x3 meters) that map relationships among interventions, land use categories, ecosystem services, and well-being — suitable as narrative, GIS-informed planning visuals.
- Quantitative potential: the workshop included planning to translate interventions into estimated percentage effects on land use, which could be incorporated into GIS-based spatial models or Bayesian networks for scenario analysis (2035 projections).
- Data integration pathway: qualitative causal diagrams and intervention-impact tables can be leveraged to build GIS-ready datasets and to inform spatial decision-support tools, with scenario-driven mapping of land use change and its social-ecological consequences.
- Stakeholder-driven data: the process captures diverse perspectives and concerns, valuable for context-aware GIS analyses and for ensuring data products reflect local realities.

End notes

- The document emphasizes participatory, visually-driven methods to develop causal models linking interventions, land use, ecosystem services, and well-being, with the ultimate goal of informing poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation strategies in Mozambique.
