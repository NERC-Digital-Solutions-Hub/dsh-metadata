# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS

- This project, ACES: Livelihoods and Land Use Change in Mozambique, used Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change in rural Mozambique through a participatory process, drawing qualitative data from 20 workshops.
- Objective: understand how wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses are interrelated; gather stakeholder ideas on interventions that could reduce poverty and conserve biodiversity; build a representative set of variables for a BBN and assess potential intervention impacts.

## Data structure and materials

- Data generated from seven .rtf files reporting workshop results (Maputo national workshop 2014, Xai-Xai 2014, Lichinga 2015, Quelimane 2015, and village workshops in 2014–2015).
- File names indicate workshop location and year; descriptions note results and content.
- Data sources include notes from 1–3 participants, post-workshop recordings (with participant consent), and photographs of materials.
- Quality control involved two writers (one drafting, the other reviewing) who were present at the workshops; final documents approved as official results.

## Quality control and data governance

- Data were collected in mixed formats and later harmonised by a two-person writing/verification process, ensuring the content remained faithful to workshop discussions.
- Visual records (photos) and available audio/notes supported verifiability; some sessions were not recorded due to participant consent.

## Development and implementation of the methodology

- Methodology built on the research team’s expertise and established references to link land use change with rural well-being via causal diagrams.
- Workshops conducted with stakeholders from Niassa (Lichinga) and Zambézia (Quelimane); participant details are provided in the document’s appendix.
- The approach emphasizes developing causal relationships rather than presenting a ready-made quantitative model.

## Objective of the workshop

- Identify key factors affecting wellbeing and their relationships to ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
- Elicit actionable ideas for interventions that could alleviate poverty and conserve biodiversity.
- Ensure broad coverage of variables to avoid missing important factors, then distill to the most important ones.
- Produce input for a representative BBN for Marrupa district, including how interventions might influence land use.

## Outputs

- Three causal diagrams per working group (drawn on large paper with variables and connections; photographed at the end).
- A table linking interventions to land use categories and indicating the most probable impacts.
- A compilation of workshop discussions to capture stakeholder concerns, understandings, and diverse viewpoints.

## Methodology and agenda

- Timeline:
  - 29 June: Pilot Workshop in Edinburgh
  - 25 July: Preparation in Maputo
  - 27 July: Pilot workshop in Maputo
  - Provincial workshops in Lichinga (4–5 Aug 2015) and Quelimane (28–29 Oct 2015)
- Structure:
  - Provincial workshops divided into two days: scenarios on day 1; BBN causal diagrams on day 2.
  - Participants split into three groups to ensure broad representation.
- Documentation:
  - Most sessions audio-recorded (plenary and some group work); some groups declined recording.
  - Presentations, group explanations, and plenary discussions were recorded; photographs of group outputs were taken.
- Terminology:
  - To avoid unfamiliarity with “BBN,” the project used “causal diagrams” or “models.”

## Workshop methodology details

- Group activities focused on three main productive activities driving land use change: subsistence agriculture, tobacco farming, and charcoal production.
- Participants first voted on wellbeing components, selecting eight priorities; from these, four components most related to ecosystem services were chosen.
- The four components were linked to listed ecosystem services; the major activity of each group was mapped to these services, followed by identification of interventions to improve activity performance and reduce adverse land-use outcomes.
- On the second day, participants formed three groups to specify interventions and estimate their effects on land use change (percent changes) using an A0 matrix. No complex accumulation effects were requested; focus was on individual intervention impacts.
- Each group presented its causal diagram and land-use change estimates for discussion; a final conclusions session and a workshop summary were conducted.
- A basic explanation of the previous year’s BBN structure and a simple data-free BBN demonstration were provided.

## Session: Effects of interventions on land use change

- For each group: identify six key interventions from the earlier exercise and estimate their potential impact on land use change (as percentages) using a matrix.
- Results were shared across groups, followed by discussion and synthesis of conclusions.
