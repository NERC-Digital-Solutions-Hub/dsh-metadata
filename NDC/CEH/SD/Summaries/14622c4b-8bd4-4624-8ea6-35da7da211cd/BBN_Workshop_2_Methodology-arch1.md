# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS

- The ACES project in Mozambique (LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE) aimed to construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change in rural Mozambique using a participatory approach, evaluating how deforestation affects rural well-being.
- The database summarizes qualitative data from 20 workshops conducted under WP1 and WP5, led by the University of Edinburgh with collaboration from Universidad Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and other partners; funded by the ESPA programme (UK government science and development funders).

## Data structure and contents

- The dataset is captured in seven .rtf files, each containing workshop results (e.g., BBN_Workshop_1_NationalMaputo_2014.rtf; BBN_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf; BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf; BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf; BBN_Workshops_Village_2014_Mabalane.rtf; BBN_Workshops_Village_2015_Marrupa.rtf).
- Files document results from workshops in Maputo (2014), Xai-Xai (2014), Lichinga (2015), Quelimane (2015), and village-level workshops (2014–2015).
- Data collection combined notes from 1–3 participants, post-workshop recordings (with participant consent), and photos of materials; results were written by two researchers (one drafting, the other reviewing) and then finalized.

## Objective of the workshops

- Build representative causal diagrams linking land use change, ecosystem services, and rural well-being, using stakeholder input to inform potential interventions.
- Gather ideas for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation, ensuring a broad set of variables is considered, then distill to the most important factors.
- Collect stakeholder perspectives to inform a relevant and representative BBN for Marrupa district and explore how interventions might influence land use.

## Key outputs

- Three causal diagrams per working group (drawn on large paper as a 2x3 metre visual; later photographed for records).
- A table mapping interventions to land-use categories, indicating the most probable impacts.
- A qualitative record of workshop discussions to capture stakeholder concerns and viewpoints.

## Methodology and agenda overview

- Timeline:
  - Pilot Workshop in Edinburgh (29 June) and Maputo preparation (25–27 July).
  - Provincial workshops in Mozambique: Lichinga (04/08/2015) and Quelimane (28–29/10/2015).
- Workshop structure:
  - Two-part provincial workshops: Day 1 focused on scenarios; Day 2 on BBN (causal diagrams).
  - Participants divided into three groups to ensure broad representation of interests.
  - Most sessions were audio-recorded (some groups gave permission; others did not), with plenary presentations and debates recorded; group discussions were sometimes not recorded.
  - Terminology: “Bayesian belief networks” were explained as “causal diagrams” to ease understanding.
- Participant activities:
  - Start from wellbeing components (participants individually voted for the eight most important components; group consensus typically identified the four most relevant to ecosystem services/forest).
  - Link wellbeing components to ecosystem services, then to the main productive activities in the district (subsistence agriculture, tobacco farming, charcoal production).
  - Identify and link activities to ecosystem services and propose actions to improve performance or reduce land-use change impacts.
- Interventions and land-use change session:
  - Participants formed three groups to select the six most important interventions based on prior exercises.
  - Each group estimated the intervention’s effect on land-use change (in percentage) using a matrix on A0 paper; no attempt was made to model interaction effects between interventions or with other factors.
  - Groups presented their causal diagrams and corresponding land-use changes, followed by a plenary discussion.
- Final steps:
  - Concluding session with a summary of findings and an overview of the basic BBN structure used as a reference for the workshops.

## Detailed methodological approach (2.0 and 2.1)

- 2.0 Workshop content focus:
  - Three groups centered on main local activities (subsistence agriculture, tobacco agriculture, charcoal production) identified as major drivers of woodland loss.
  - Initially, 30 wellbeing components were proposed; participants voted to select the top eight, then the four most related to ecosystem services for diagram construction.
  - The activities were linked to ecosystem services and to the chosen wellbeing components; interventions were proposed to improve activity performance and reduce negative land-use effects.
- 2.1 Effects of interventions on land use change:
  - Each of the three groups chose six interventions and estimated their impact on land use change (in percentage) using a comparative matrix.
  - The exercise did not require computations of cumulative or interaction effects between interventions.
  - Groups then explained their diagrams and the associated land-use changes, followed by discussion and a final workshop conclusion.

## Context and challenges for data work

- The project explicitly used qualitative, participatory data to inform causal models (BBNs) rather than relying solely on quantitative data.
- Data integration across diverse sources and formats was a core part of the methodology, reflecting broader analytical challenges in data access, standardisation, and stakeholder-driven data generation typical of Analysts Answering Questions with Data.
