# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VILLAGE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Mabalane, Marrupa and Gurue Districts, 2015

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of the ACES project on livelihoods and land use change in Mozambique.
  - Objective: construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change and wellbeing via participatory workshops.
  - Output includes qualitative data from 20 workshops across national, provincial, and village levels; aims to evaluate deforestation impacts on rural well-being.

- Data structure and contents
  - Seven .rtf files report the main results of the 20 workshops:
    - Examples include BBN_Workshop_1_NationalMaputo_2014.rtf, BBN_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf, BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf, etc.
  - Each file contains descriptive results (uncompressed files in KB) from specific workshops and locations.
  - Data capture includes qualitative workshop outputs, not quantitative statistics at this stage.

- Data collection methods and quality control
  - Data gathered via notes by 1–3 participants; recordings with participant consent; photos of generated materials.
  - Writing and compilation process:
    - One person drafts results, a second person reviews, both attended the workshops, final approval by both.
  - Quality assurance considerations include multi-method capture (notes, recordings, photos) and cross-checking by researchers present at the workshops.

- Methodology and workflow
  - Village workshops (Mabalane, Marrupa, Gurue) use focus groups to construct preliminary causal diagrams (BBNs) of wellbeing, ecosystem services, land-use change, and policies.
  - A national-provincial-village integration process:
    - Create national, provincial, and village BBNs; identify common and unique variables.
    - Integrate into an “integrated BBN,” prioritizing village-based wellbeing variables and policy/driver variables from higher levels.
    - Iterate with researchers and stakeholders to refine structure; next step is collecting quantitative data to populate states and probabilities.
  - Output is an iterative, stakeholder-informed design with multiple review rounds to converge on a final BBN.

- Outputs and dissemination
  - Village-level causal diagrams (one per village) showing variables and links (without quantitative data).
  - An integrated national/provincial/village BBN framework, incorporating feedback across levels.
  - Later collection of quantitative data to populate the BBN (possible states and link probabilities).
  - Stakeholder workshops at province level to evaluate and adjust the BBN design.
  - The process and results feed policy-oriented recommendations to government rather than direct village interventions.

- Village and participant selection
  - Villages chosen to span a deforestation gradient to capture diverse variables; if limited, extremes of the gradient prioritized.
  - Each village workshop targets 8 participants to ensure broad participation and manageable group dynamics.
  - Participant composition aimed at gender balance (4 women, 4 men), varied ages, and diverse occupations; aim to avoid village chief and to include representation across social roles and livelihoods.

- Facilitator role and training
  - Ideal facilitators are local-language-speaking individuals with field experience (e.g., ACES fieldwork participants) or forestry technicians.
  - Preference for facilitators who are neutral and able to minimize directed influence; some government presence can lend legitimacy but should not dominate the process.
  - Facilitator training planned, including a couple of pilot workshops to refine methods and build facilitation skills.

- Participatory rules and guidelines
  - Good participatory rules include: only one person speaks at a time; data anonymized; all views are important; session length approximately 1.5–2 hours.
  - Emphasis on creating an open, respectful environment and on capturing diverse perspectives.

- Equipment and logistics
  - Required items include local-language facilitator, three large 2x3 meter sheets of paper, stacking/attachment materials, markers, recording devices, photo equipment, and other supplies.
  - Logistics consider capturing and compiling images, as well as ensuring readiness of participants and materials.

- Workshop structure and agenda
  - Introduction and explanation of wellbeing concepts and ecosystem services; clear statement of research objective and policy-oriented outcomes.
  - Step-by-step activities:
    - Brainstorm and identify wellbeing components, explain wellbeing concepts, and select key components (often using pictures/drawings).
    - Place components on a large paper sheet; rank importance among components to capture priority factors.
    - Link wellbeing components to forest ecosystem services using a central forest image; add causal links or new variables (pictures/drawings) to represent relationships.
    - Open discussion on possible improvements and management actions for forest and machamba (agricultural plots).
    - Facilitator summarizes results, explains the modelling intent, and conducts an oral evaluation of the workshop.
  - A second set of information and guidance documents accompany the workshop (participatory rules, agenda, list of wellbeing components, ecosystem services, and final discussion prompts).

- Data governance and stewardship considerations
  - The dataset is intended to inform policy at national and provincial levels and is not designed to trigger direct village intervention.
  - Documentation and metadata practices are essential to ensure the BBNs’ variables and relationships are clearly defined and interoperable across levels.
  - Ongoing integration and revision require transparent versioning, stakeholder feedback loops, and careful handling of qualitative data before any quantitative population of states and probabilities.
  - Privacy and consent are addressed through anonymization of data and controlled use for policy development.

- Potential limitations and considerations for Data Stewards
  - Variability in data capture formats (rtf files, notes, drawings) may affect interoperability.
  - Qualitative nature of initial outputs requires careful translation into quantitative model parameters.
  - Ensuring consistent variable naming and definitions across national, provincial, and village levels is critical for coherent integration.

- Key date and provenance
  - Documented in 2015 as part of ACES: Livelihoods and Land Use Change in Mozambique; collaboration among University of Edinburgh, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and other partners; funded by ESPA.
