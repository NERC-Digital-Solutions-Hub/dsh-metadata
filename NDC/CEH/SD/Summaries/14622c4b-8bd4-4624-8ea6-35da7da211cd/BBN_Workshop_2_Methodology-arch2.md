# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015

## Introduction
- The database was created by WP5 and WP1 of ACES: LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE.
- Project led by the University of Edinburgh; collaboration with Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and others.
- Funded by ESPA (Ecosystems Services for Poverty Alleviation) via UK funders (NERC, ESRC, DfID).
- Objective: construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future rural Mozambique land use change using a participatory approach to assess deforestation impacts on rural well-being.
- The database includes qualitative data from 20 workshops aligned with this objective.

## Data structure
- Data base comprises seven .rtf files reporting the main results of the 20 workshops.
- Examples of files:
  - BBN_Workshop_1_NationalMaputo_2014.rtf (Maputo workshop results)
  - BBN_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf (Xai Xai workshop)
  - BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf (Lichinga workshop)
  - BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf (Quelimane workshop)
  - BBN_Workshops_Village_2014_Mabalane.rtf
  - BBN_Workshops_Village_2015_Marrupa.rtf
- File sizes range from small to large; each file contains workshop results.

## Quality control
- Data collected in multiple formats:
  - 1–3 people taking notes during workshops.
  - Most discussions recorded after participants’ consent.
  - Photos taken of materials with legible content.
- Documentation process:
  - Two writers prepared initial versions; one or both reviewed content; final approval by both present during workshops.

## Development and implementation of the methodology
- Methodology built from the research team’s expertise and relevant references.
- Purpose: construct causal diagrams linking land use change to rural population well-being; results presented as diagrams rather than quantitative models at this stage.
- Workshops included representatives from Niassa (Lichinga) and Zambezia (Quelimane).
- Workshop dates:
  - Lichinga: 04/08/2015
  - Quelimane: 28/10/2015

## 1. Objective of the workshop
- Capture key factors influencing well-being and their links to ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
- Elicit ideas for actions that could support poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
- Aim to include as many relevant variables as possible initially, then identify the most important ones.
- Additional aims: generate new knowledge, stimulate reflection and stakeholder engagement, and ensure stakeholder voices are heard.
- Specific goals:
  - Collect input from stakeholders to construct a relevant and representative BBN for Marrupa district.
  - Gather stakeholder views on how interventions could influence land use change.

## 1.2 Output
- Three causal diagrams per working group (variables and links, no quantitative data yet) drawn on large paper (2x3 metres) and photographed at the end.
- A table linking interventions to land use categories with the most probable impacts.
- Documentation of workshop discussions to capture stakeholder concerns, understandings, and diverse perspectives.

## 1.3 Methodology and Agenda
- Timeline and structure:
  - 29 June: Pilot Workshop in Edinburgh
  - 25 July: Preparation meeting in Maputo
  - 27 July: Pilot workshop in Maputo
  - Provincial workshops (Lichinga and Quelimane): two days each
    - Day 1: Scenarios workshop
    - Day 2: BBN workshop
- Group organization:
  - Participants divided into 3 groups to ensure broad representation of interests.
- Recording:
  - Most sessions audio-recorded; some groups did not permit recording.
  - Presentations and plenary discussions recorded; group work results documented with notes and photos.
- Terminology:
  - “BBN” often referred to as “causal diagrams” or models to facilitate understanding.
- Agenda highlights (Second day):
  - Introduction to causal diagrams linking ecosystem services and well-being.
  - Group exercises on well-being components, ecosystem services, factors driving forest degradation and land use changes (e.g., subsistence agriculture, tobacco farming, charcoal production).
  - Identification of potential interventions and their effects on land use change.
  - Group reports on constructed diagrams and proposed land use changes, followed by discussion.
  - Final conclusions and workshop close.
- 2. Workshop methodology followed
  - Brief introduction to causal loop diagrams before constructing causal diagrams illustrating relationships among interventions, land use, ecosystem services, and well-being.
  - Three groups focused on main productive activities (subsistence agriculture, tobacco agriculture, charcoal production) as primary drivers of land use change; optional inclusion of other activities if proposed by participants.
  - Activity and well-being prioritization:
    - Participants voted to select the 8 most important well-being components.
    - From those, the 4 components most related to ecosystem services were chosen and linked to ecosystem services list from earlier workshops.
    - The chosen activities were linked to ecosystem services; actions proposed to improve activity performance and reduce adverse land use impacts.
- 2.1 Session on Effects of interventions on land use change
  - Three groups identified the 6 most important interventions.
  - For each intervention, participants estimated its effect on land use change (percent) using an A0 matrix.
  - No explicit modeling of interaction effects between interventions; groups presented their diagrams and land use change estimates, followed by discussion.
  - Concluding session included a workshop summary and a basic, data-free illustration of a simple BBN to convey the concept.
