# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VILLAGE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Mabalane, Marrupa and Gurue Districts, 2015

- This document describes how the ACES project conducted participatory workshops to develop Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) for modelling land use change and rural well-being in Mozambique.
- Projects involved: ACES – Livelihoods and Land Use Change in Mozambique; led by University of Edinburgh, with Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and others; funded by ESPA (NERC/ESRC/DfID).
- Objective of the workshops: generate qualitative data to construct causal diagrams linking land use change, ecosystem services, and rural well-being, forming the basis for subsequent quantitative BBNs.

## Data structure and quality control

- Data produced by seven .rtf files reporting results from 20 workshops:
  - NationalMaputo (2014), Province_XaiXai (2014), Province_Lichinga (2015), Province_Quelimane (2015), Village_Mabalane (2014), Village_Gurue (2015), Village_Marrupa (2015).
- Data collection methods:
  - Notes by 1–3 staff during workshops.
  - Recorded discussions with participant consent.
  - Photos of materials to preserve readability.
- Authorship and verification:
  - Two-person drafting process; each document created during/after workshops with involvement of participants present; final review before official results.
- Quality considerations:
  - Varied data formats and sources; emphasis on accuracy and traceability through cross-checks and participant presence.

## Methodology and workshop design

- Foundation: methodology built from the research team’s expertise and bibliographic references; aims to link land use change and rural well-being via causal diagrams (BBNs).
- Workshop scope:
  - Village-scale workshops with 8–15 villagers; implemented in Mabalane, Marrupa, Gurue (Aug 2014–Nov 2015).
- Outputs per workshop:
  - A village-level causal diagram (BBN initial structure) containing variables and links (no quantitative data yet).
  - An integrated national/provincial/village BBN structure after comparing workshop outputs; planned quantitative data collection in a later phase.
  - Iterative refinement with stakeholder feedback across levels to finalize the design.
- Workshop format:
  - Focus group sessions capped at about 2 hours.
  - Large-format, paper-based activity (2x3 metres) with pictures/drawings representing variables.
  - Facilitator-led process to elicit wellbeing components, link them to ecosystem services and forest change, and identify causal relationships.
- Integration approach:
  - Compare national, provincial, and village BBNs to identify common and unique variables.
  - Create an integrated BBN prioritizing village-level wellbeing drivers and national/provincial drivers where appropriate.
  - Assess network coherence; adjust by adding/removing variables or relations; multiple stakeholder feedback rounds.

## Selection of villages and participants

- Village selection:
  - Prefer workshops in villages along the deforestation gradient to maximize variable representation.
  - If limited by logistics, select extremes of the gradient to cover diverse variables.
  - Include national and provincial workshops to ensure broad coverage; aim for 2–3 local workshops as a verification step.
- Participant composition:
  - Target group size: 8 participants per village workshop.
  - Representation: aim for gender balance (4 women, 4 men), varied ages, and diverse occupations (farmers, herders, charcoal producers, traders, etc.).
  - Exclude the village chief when possible to reduce power dynamics; ensure inclusion of different social roles.
  - Practical distribution: 2 old women, 2 young women, 2 old men, 2 young men.
- Facilitator profile:
  - Prefer local-language speakers or forestry technicians; ideally a student familiar with ACES fieldwork to minimize bias.
  - Training prior to workshops; conduct pilot sessions to refine technique.
  - Minimal direct authority presence during the exercises to maintain participant openness.

## Facilitators, rules, and logistics

- Facilitator roles and training:
  - Train on project context, exercise goals, and facilitation rules.
  - Pilot workshops to calibrate approach and minimize bias.
- Participatory rules (good practice):
  - One person speaks at a time; data kept confidential and anonymized.
  - All opinions considered equally important.
  - Session duration approximately 1.5–2 hours.
- Practical implementation steps (to-do):
  - Identify and coordinate with a suitable facilitator.
  - Align with WP2 and WP3 for added responsibilities (beyond translation).
- Workshop introduction and conduct:
  - Welcome participants; explain objectives and that government recommendations may arise from the results but no direct village intervention will be imposed.
  - Emphasize mutual learning and local knowledge as the basis of the exercise.
  - Present guidelines, ensure understanding of wellbeing concepts, and describe the use of pictures/drawings to represent concepts.
  - Encourage broad participation; if some participants are quiet, use targeted questions to involve them.

## Workshop content, agenda, and outputs

- Agenda highlights:
  - Brainstorm and explain wellbeing components and the concept of wellbeing.
  - Participants select the six most important wellbeing components.
  - Explore how these components relate to ecosystem services and forest use; establish causality links.
  - Add additional variables and links as identified during discussion.
  - Discuss potential interventions or policies that could improve wellbeing and forest conservation.
  - Facilitator summarizes findings; discuss how results will inform a model of policy impacts.
  - Optional: present a draft “white paper” of results for participant feedback; conduct an oral evaluation.
- Information and materials:
  - A structured list of wellbeing components and ecosystem services to guide discussion (examples include health, education, water access, livestock, machamba, firewood, charcoal, timber, medicinal plants, pastures, construction materials, sacred places, etc.).
  - Use of large sheets and images/drawings to facilitate inclusive participation and mitigate literacy barriers.
- Output and next steps:
  - Immediate output: a village-level causal diagram (BBN) with variables and links but without quantitative probabilities.
  - Integrated output: an “integrated BBN” combining national, provincial, and village inputs; identify core variables to inform later quantitative data gathering.
  - Next steps: collect quantitative data to populate states and link probabilities; conduct stakeholder reviews at province level to validate and adjust the integrated BBN.

## Key references and methodological foundations

- Chan, Ross, Hoverman, and Powell (2010) referenced for participatory development of Bayesian networks in catchment-based water resource management.
- Bryman (2012) cited regarding qualitative methods and focus group practices.

## Equipment and logistical needs

- Essential items:
  - Local-language facilitator, large 2x3 metre paper sheets, stacking/attachment system for images, markers, recording device, photo equipment, image compilation, scissors, basic supplies, and participant refreshments as needed.

## Summary of core concepts

- The village BBN workshops are a structured, participatory approach to co-create causal models linking ecosystem services, forest use, and rural well-being.
- The process integrates village-level insights with provincial and national perspectives to build an integrated BBN, later populated with quantitative data.
- Emphasis is placed on inclusive participation, transparent governance of data, iterative refinement with stakeholder input, and practical considerations for fieldwork in rural Mozambique.
