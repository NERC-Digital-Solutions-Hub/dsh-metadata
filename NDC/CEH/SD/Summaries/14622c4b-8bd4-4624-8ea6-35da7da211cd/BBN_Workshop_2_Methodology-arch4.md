# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015

## Overview
- Project objective: construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change scenarios in rural Mozambique using participatory methods, assessing deforestation impacts on rural well-being.
- Output scope: qualitative data from 20 workshops, compiled into seven .rtf data files describing results.
- Data purpose: generate causal diagrams linking land use change, ecosystem services, and well-being; derive interventions and their likely impacts.

## Data structure
- Seven .rtf files reporting workshop results:
  - Examples include Maputo national workshop results and provincial/workshop results for Xai Xai, Lichinga, and Quelimane (with multiple village/province iterations).
  - File names indicate location, year (2014–2015), and workshop type (national, provincial, village).
- File sizes vary, reflecting narrative qualitative content (e.g., 16,151 KB; 20,282 KB; 448–18,084 KB per file).
- Purpose of files: document outcomes of each workshop, including causal diagrams and associated observations.

## Data quality and governance
- Data collection methods varied: field notes by 1–3 participants, post-workshop discussions recorded with participant consent, photos of materials.
- Quality control process:
  - Two researchers wrote initial results; a second reviewer who attended the workshop validated and approved final documents.
- Documentation also includes photos of working materials to aid interpretation.

## Methodology and process
- Methodology designed by the research team to link land use change with rural well-being via causal (BBN) diagrams.
- Workshops conducted in two provinces: Niassa (Lichinga) and Zambezia (Quelimane), with participant representation from multiple institutions.
- Terminology used in practice: “causal diagrams” or models instead of BBN to improve participant understanding.
- Timeline:
  - Pilot in Edinburgh (June 29) and Maputo (July 2015).
  - Provincial workshops in Lichinga (Aug 4–5, 2015) and Quelimane (Oct 28–29, 2015).
- Workshop structure:
  - Two-part provincial workshops: scenarios workshop followed by BBN/causal diagram development.
  - Participants divided into three groups to ensure broad representation of interests.
  - Sessions largely audio-recorded (some groups permitted recording; plenary sessions always recorded) plus written notes and presentations.
- Data handling: final outputs include both diagrams and accompanying discussion captures.

## Workshop design and activities
- Focus areas: ecosystem services, well-being, and major productive activities driving land use (subsistence agriculture, tobacco farming, charcoal production).
- Well-being components: participants independently voted for eight key well-being components, then narrowed to four most connected to ecosystem services.
- Linking activities to ecosystem services: each activity mapped to relevant ecosystem services and then assessed for impacts on land use.
- Intervention analysis: groups selected six interventions, estimated their potential impact on land use (percent change) using a matrix; results discussed and shared as causal diagrams.

## Outputs
- Three causal diagrams produced per workshop group, illustrating variables and links (on large paper) without quantitative data.
- A table mapping interventions to land-use categories to indicate likely impacts.
- Documentation of stakeholder concerns, viewpoints, and debates to enrich understanding and future modeling.
- Presentations and discussions archived (photos of diagrams and group outputs) to support transparency and reproducibility.

## Participating institutions
- Lichinga Workshop (Niassa): multiple organizations including UP-Niassa, ORAM-Niassa, UN Lúrio, We Effect, DPA-Niassa, SDPI-Marrupa, Eco Turismo, WWF-Niassa, ACES, and others.
- Quelimane Workshop (Zambézia): numerous organizations including DP Ciência e Tecnologia Zambézia, Escola Superior de Ciências Marinhas e Costeiras/UEM, ITC-Zambézia, DPA-SPFFB, AMZA, FONGA, SDAE-Gurué, IIAM-Zambézia, APAMAZ, ORAM Zambézia, among others.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- End-to-end data lifecycle: captures a structured approach to producing qualitative data into usable causal models for policy and planning.
- Data governance and quality: explicit QA processes (dual writing, participant validation, and use of photos) demonstrate robust data integrity practices.
- Stakeholder engagement and co-ownership: participatory design ensures data products reflect diverse user needs and perspectives.
- Data discoverability and documentation: clear file naming, comprehensive narrative records, and images of outputs support discoverability and replication.
- Data lineage for modeling: outputs are directly connected to workshop activities, enabling traceability from inputs (stakeholder discussions) to modeled diagrams and intervention scenarios.
- Practical data curation: files are narrative and qualitative, offering rich context for future qualitative analysis and scenario planning, with explicit non-quantitative outputs.

## Key takeaways for Data Leaders
- Employ participatory methods to enrich data products with diverse stakeholder insights.
- Document data provenance comprehensively (collection methods, recording permissions, validation steps, and artifact preservation).
- Use accessible, non-technical representations (causal diagrams) to foster understanding and buy-in from non-specialist users.
- Maintain clear data structure and metadata by organizing outputs around workshops, locations, dates, and participants.
- Capture both outputs and deliberations to support interpretability and future re-use in modeling and policy discussions.
