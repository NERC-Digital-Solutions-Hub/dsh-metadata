# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai Xai, 2014

- Context and aims
  - ACES project aimed to construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change in rural Mozambique using a participatory approach.
  - Objective: evaluate how deforestation may affect rural well-being; use qualitative data from 20 workshops to build and refine the models.
  - Project lead: University of Edinburgh; collaborators include Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and others; funded by ESPA ( UK government agencies ).

- Data structure and sources
  - Qualitative data from 20 workshops compiled into seven .rtf files, each representing workshop results across different locations and years (Maputo 2014; Xai Xai 2014; Lichinga 2015; Quelimane 2015; Mabalane 2014; Gurue 2015; Marrupa 2015).
  - Files vary in size (from a few hundred KB to over 20 MB) and summarize workshop outcomes.

- Quality control and data handling
  - Data collection used multiple methods: note-taking by 1–3 persons, recorded discussions with participant consent, and photographs of materials.
  - A two-person writing process ensured cross-checking: a first draft followed by review by a second participant present at the workshops; final approval as official results.
  - Acknowledges variation in note-taking effectiveness due to fieldwork logistics and recommends trained note-takers integrated into the ACES team for future work.

- Methodology development and implementation
  - Methodology built on the project team’s expertise and relevant references to construct causal diagrams linking land use change and rural well-being.
  - Workshops conducted at different governance levels (national in Maputo; provincial in Xai Xai) to capture diverse perspectives.
  - Terminology adjusted for accessibility: participants responded to “Model” rather than “Bayesian belief networks.”

- Objectives of the workshops
  - Identify factors influencing well-being and their relationships to ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
  - Gather stakeholder ideas on actions for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
  - Emphasize capturing as many variables as possible initially, then prioritizing the most important ones.
  - Additional aims: generate new knowledge, elicit concerns and diverse viewpoints from stakeholders.

- Outputs and anticipated products
  - Primary outputs: three causal diagrams per workshop representing variables and links (without quantitative data).
  - A subsequent, quantitative BBN would be built from national, provincial, and village workshop data, selecting key variables and links.
  - An additional outcome: preserve workshop discussions to understand stakeholder perceptions and viewpoints.
  - Diagram format: large-scale, 2x3 meter sheets with variables on paper pieces and connections; photographs of each diagram taken at workshop end.

- Detailed workshop process and structure
  - Maputo (National workshop, 11–12 Aug 2014)
    - Two-part format: BBN construction and scenario development.
    - Participants divided into three groups (Manica, Niassa, National policies); some sessions not audio-recorded due to initial concerns about recording impact on dialogue (later decisions allowed recording in Xai Xai).
    - Early activities included presenting research questions, defining indicators for rural well-being, woodland cover, biodiversity, and ecosystem services; establishing physical boundaries and timescales (3 districts; 5–20 year horizons).
    - Emphasis on group-based activities: identifying main wellbeing components, linking to ecosystem services, and constructing initial BBN relationships.
  - Xai Xai (Provincial workshop, 13 Aug 2014)
    - Similar two-part structure; included explicit recording of conversations (participants allowed recording).
    - Three groups: A-National, B-Niassa, C-Manica.
    - Included reflective discussion on missing elements of the BBNs and comparisons across groups (screen-based comparison of voting outcomes).

- Detailed timetable highlights (Maps and Xai Xai)
  - Maputo: start with agenda and participant introductions; present research questions; build the BBN in three groups; time allocations included plenary presentations, group drawing of links, and final plenary review.
  - Xai Xai: similar sequence with explicit time blocks for agenda, research questions, BBN construction, group work, tea breaks, and final plenary presentations and conclusions.
  - Across both locations: workshop days structured around drafting variables, linking them into causal diagrams, and producing group presentations of the three BBNs.

- Lessons learned and recommendations for future monitoring work
  - Naming and communication: use “Model” terminology to avoid confusion around “BBN.”
  - Data collection roles: assign dedicated, well-trained note-takers for each group and ensure they participate in preparation to capture main ideas, dialogue flow, who said what, and the evolution of discussion.
  - Recording considerations: allow or plan for audio recording when feasible to improve data capture; plan for potential trade-offs between recording and free discussion.
  - Data reuse and standardisation: design processes that facilitate storing and uploading datasets to appropriate portals, enabling others to access underlying data used in outputs.
  - Continuity planning: prepare for fieldwork timing and staffing constraints to ensure robust data capture (e.g., full-day coverage per group).

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and data-centric analysis
  - Demonstrates a structured, participatory approach to building a standardized, qualitative knowledge base that supports a future quantitative BBN.
  - Shows practical considerations for data quality assurance, documentation of discussion processes, and the value of storing outputs for policy and well-being assessment.
  - Highlights the need to balance stakeholder engagement with rigorous data recording and to prepare for data integration across national, provincial, and village scales.
