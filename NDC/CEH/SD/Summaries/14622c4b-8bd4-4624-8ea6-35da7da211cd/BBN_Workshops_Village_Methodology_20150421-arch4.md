# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VILLAGE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Mabalane, Marrupa and Gurue Districts, 2015

- Aim and scope
  - Develop Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change and rural wellbeing in Mozambique using a participatory approach.
  - Produce qualitative data from 20 workshops; outputs include village-level BBNs and an integrated national/provincial/village BBN plan. 
  - Next step: collect quantitative data to populate the BBNs; iteratively refine with stakeholders.

- Data structure and quality control
  - Data stored in seven .rtf files, each capturing main results from the 20 workshops.
  - File examples include national, provincial, and village workshop results with substantial narrative content.
  - Quality control: multiple data-collection methods (notes by 1–3 people, post-workshop recordings with participant consent, photographs of materials); two researchers draft and then co-review final results to official status.

- Methodology and workshop design
  - Village-scale workshops (8–15 villagers per session) to construct preliminary causal diagrams linking wellbeing, ecosystem services, forest resources, and land use.
  - Outputs: a village-level causal diagram; subsequent national/provincial data used to build an integrated BBN.
  - Integration approach: compare village, provincial, and national BBNs to identify common and unique variables; create an integrated structure prioritizing village wellbeing variables and policy/driver variables from higher levels; iterative refinement with researcher and stakeholder input.

- Outputs and data use
  - Immediate output: a qualitative causal diagram (BBN) for each village (variables and links, no quantitative probabilities yet).
  - Final output: an integrated BBN design; later, quantitative data gathered to populate states and probabilities.
  - Stakeholder involvement: workshops reviewed and adjusted based on feedback at province level; goals include legitimacy and practical relevance for policy.

- Data collection and variables
  - Household surveys, focus groups, and interviews capture extensive variables (demographics, education, health, income, assets, forest product use, ES dependency, land use, farming practices, charcoal/firewood, etc.).
  - Objective is to identify statistical relationships and important variables driving wellbeing and ES use; village-level data used for local relations, with national/provincial data informing drivers and policies.
  - Data collection designed to reveal causal links between wellbeing components, ES, and forest/land-use changes.

- Workshop logistics and participant selection
  - Village selection aims to cover a deforestation gradient; if limited, extremes are chosen to maximize variable capture.
  - Participant group size: about 8 people per workshop to ensure broad participation; try to include gender balance, diverse ages, and different occupations; avoid dominance by village chiefs; a mix of farmers, herders, charcoal producers, traders, etc.
  - Facilitator role: local language speaker; ideally a student involved in WP2/3 or a forestry technician; facilitator training recommended; pilot workshops suggested to refine method.
  - Participatory rules: confidential, one person speaks at a time, all views matter, sessions last 1.5–2 hours.

- Facilitator guidance and good practices
  - Clear introduction of objectives, wellbeing concept, and ES/forest context; use pictures/drawings to represent wellbeing factors and variables.
  - Participants collaboratively create a large visual representation (2x3 metre) of the BBN with guidance from the facilitator.
  - Ranking of wellbeing components to identify priority factors; linking components to forest/ES; discussion of potential interventions.

- Data governance, ethics, and dissemination
  - Emphasis on anonymized data and voluntary participation; results shared as government recommendations, not direct village interventions.
  - Iterative review process with Edinburgh ACES team and stakeholders to ensure coherence and applicability.

- Equipment and logistics
  - Required: local-language facilitator, large 2x3 metre papers, materials to attach visuals, markers, photo equipment, and supplies for participant refreshments as needed.
  - Documentation and outputs include compiled images and a final integrated BBN framework after stakeholder validation.

- Content focus: wellbeing components and ecosystem services
  - Wellbeing components include a wide range of factors (e.g., health, education, housing, water, safe living, social relations, income, assets, land access, agricultural capacity, etc.).
  - Ecosystem services emphasized include firewood, charcoal and timber resources, hunting, pastures, land for machambas, construction materials, medicinal plants, wild foods, and sacred/forest resources.
  - Additional prompts guide discussion on forest quality, soil fertility, pasture management, land conflicts, and agricultural practices.

- Endnotes and references
  - Methodological references informing participatory BN development: Chan et al. (2010) and Bryman (2012).
  - Overall aim: ensure the resulting BBNs accurately reflect real-world dynamics and are usable for policy considerations and poverty alleviation through improved data-informed planning.
