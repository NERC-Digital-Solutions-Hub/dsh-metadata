# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VILLAGE BBN WORKSHOPS

- Overview
  - Aims to construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change and rural well-being in Mozambique using participatory workshops.
  - Part of the ACES: Livelihoods and Land Use Change in Mozambique project (WP1 and WP5), led by University of Edinburgh; collaboration with Universidad Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and others; funded by ESPA (NERC/ESRC/DfID).
  - Outputs qualitative data from 20 workshops across national, provincial, and village levels; intention to progressively build a quantitative BBN.

- Data structure
  - Data stored in seven .rtf files, each reporting workshop results:
    - National Maputo 2014; Province Xai Xai 2014; Province Lichinga 2015; Province Quelimane 2015; Village workshops: Mabalane (2014), Gurue (2015), Marrupa (2015).
  - File sizes range from hundreds to tens of thousands of kilobytes, reflecting narrative results and diagrams.

- Quality control
  - Data collected via multiple methods: note-taking by 1–3 people; audio recording with participant consent; photos of materials.
  - Two researchers authored the write-ups; both attended workshops; final documents reviewed and approved as official project results.

- Development and implementation of the methodology
  - Methodology developed by the research team, drawing on prior references; designed to build causal diagrams linking land use change to rural well-being.
  - Village-scale workshops (8–15 participants) documented with participant details in each file.
  - Workshops used to produce preliminary causal diagrams, later integrated into an overarching BBN framework.

- Objective of the workshops
  - Capture direct input from rural inhabitants on factors affecting well-being and their relationship to ecosystem services (ES), miombo woodland, and land uses.
  - Elicit ideas for government/community actions to alleviate poverty and conserve forests.
  - Compile a broad set of variables first, then refine to the most important ones; generate knowledge, reflect community concerns, and empower local voices.

- Data collected
  - Household (HH) survey data covering: household size, education, health, medicinal plants, dwelling, fuel/wood use, land use, income, forest products, fishing, paid work, agriculture, livestock, assets, services access, shocks, coping strategies, subjective well-being.
  - Focus groups and interviews on village-level topics: charcoal production, village characteristics, health, water, migration, markets, ES usage over time.
  - Purpose: identify statistical relationships within district HH data and village-level patterns; contrasts with BBN workshops where causality diagrams are co-created with participants.

- Output
  - Primary deliverable: a village-level causal diagram (BBN) with variables and links (qualitative, not yet quantitative).
  - Next step: develop an integrated national/provincial/village BBN by selecting common and most relevant variables; later collect quantitative data to populate states and probabilities.
  - Iterative process: researchers, ACES team, and stakeholders review and revise the integrated BBN across levels.

- Methodology details
  - Workshops designed as focus groups focused on constructing preliminary BBNs on wellbeing, ES, land use change, and policies.
  - Village workshops preferred in locations with prior ACES fieldwork; otherwise, advance contact with village authorities to select prepared participants.
  - Integration: compare national, provincial, and village BBNs to identify common variables; weight village-level variables for wellbeing and policy-level drivers for change; adjust structure for coherence with stakeholders’ feedback.

- Equipment and logistics
  - Local language facilitator; large 2x3 meter papers; pinning/staging system; markers; labeling and photo equipment; paper cuts; provisions for participants.
  - Selection of villages prioritized along a deforestation gradient to maximize variable diversity; if limited, extremes of the gradient favored.
  - Participant selection: aim for 8 participants per village, balanced gender and age, diverse livelihoods, avoiding chiefs to minimize power dynamics.

- Facilitator considerations
  - Ideal facilitator: local-language-speaking person with field experience (e.g., a student who participated in WP2/3) or a forestry technician.
  - Training recommended prior to workshops; conduct 1–2 pilot sessions to refine method.
  - Facilitator manages introductions, explains objectives, enforces participatory rules, guides activities, and summarizes results.

- Participatory rules
  - One person speaks at a time; data anonymized; all views welcomed; session length about 1.5–2 hours.
  - Emphasis on inclusive participation, especially from quieter participants; use of pictures/drawings to facilitate input.

- To-do and procedural notes
  - Recruit and coordinate the facilitator; align with WP2/3; prepare logistics and materials.
  - Conduct introductions and explain objectives, ES concepts, and potential policy implications to participants.
  - Elicit wellbeing components, select representative images, and map relationships to ES on a large paper.
  - Elicit potential interventions and policies; facilitator provides a summary and notes addressing feasibility and expectations.
  - Deliverables: village white papers and an integrated, stakeholder-informed BBN; plan for subsequent quantitative data collection and model refinement.

- Workshop flow (condensed)
  - Explain objectives and wellbeing concept; discuss and select key wellbeing factors (using pictures/drawings).
  - Arrange factors on a large paper and link to a forest/ES central image; add relationships and potential intermediate variables.
  - Elicit policies or actions to improve wellbeing and forest stewardship; capture ideas with minimal constraints.
  - Facilitator summarizes and notes on the workshop’s usefulness and potential next steps; discuss dissemination of results and expectations.

- Information and content guidance provided
  - Participatory rules brief; agenda for village BBN workshop; list of wellbeing components (e.g., health, food, housing, education, water, safety, empowerment, income, social relations, land access, etc.).
  - Key ecosystem services identified for discussion (firewood, charcoal, hunting, pastures, machamba land, construction materials, medicinal plants, wild foods, forest-derived inputs, timber, sacred places, etc.).
  - Additional guiding questions for final discussion (e.g., forest suitability for construction materials, soil fertility practices, pasture management, land conflicts, manure use, vegetable farming).

- Overall outcome
  - A robust, participatory process to generate village-level causal diagrams for well-being and ecosystem services, subsequently integrated into a national/provincial BBN framework, with plans to populate it with quantitative data and refine through stakeholder feedback.
