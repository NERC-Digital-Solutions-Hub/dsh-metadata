# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai Xai, 2014 Pedro Zorrilla-Miras 2014 ACES: LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE WP 1 AND 5

- Purpose and aim
  - Build Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change scenarios in rural Mozambique using a participatory approach.
  - Assess impacts on rural population well-being and biodiversity due to deforestation.
  - Collect and synthesize qualitative data from 20 workshops conducted within the ACES project.

- Data structure and storage
  - Data organized into seven .rtf files, each reporting results from different workshops:
    - National Maputo 2014 (Maputo)
    - Provincial Xai-Xai 2014 (Xai-Xai)
    - Provincial Lichinga 2015
    - Provincial Quelimane 2015
    - Village workshops Mabalane 2014
    - Village Gurue 2015
    - Village Marrupa 2015
  - Each file contains workshop results (descriptions and qualitative findings) rather than quantitative data.

- Quality control and data collection
  - Data gathered through multiple methods: note-taking by 1–3 people, post-workshop recording with participant consent, and photo documentation of materials.
  - A two-person writing process: first draft by one writer, second review by a second person present at the workshop; final approval by both.
  - Recognized variability in data capture due to field workload and team constraints; a recommendation to assign a dedicated, well-trained note-taker for future workshops.
  - Terminology: to ease acceptance, the term “BBN” was sometimes referred to as a “Model.”

- Development and implementation of the methodology
  - Methodology developed by the ACES research team, drawing on established references.
  - Aim was to construct causal diagrams linking land use change to rural well-being and to use these to build BBNs.
  - Workshops conducted in Maputo (national scale) and Xai-Xai (provincial scale) with representatives from various stakeholder groups.

- Objectives of the workshops
  - Identify and relate key factors influencing rural well-being, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
  - Elicit potential actions for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
  - Ensure broad coverage of variables to avoid missing important factors; later select the most important variables.
  - Produce outputs that generate new knowledge, encourage stakeholder reflection, and amplify their voices in the process.

- Outputs and intended future work
  - Immediate outputs: three causal diagrams (BBN components) produced per workshop, detailing variables and links without quantitative data.
  - Long-term outputs: a unified BBN constructed from National, Provincial, and Village workshop information; selection of the most important variables and meaningful links to define the BBN structure.
  - Future step: collect quantitative data (state definitions, probabilities for links) to populate the BBN.
  - Additional outputs: capture workshop discussions to understand stakeholder concerns and perspectives.
  - Format: causal diagrams drawn on large paper sheets (2x3 meters) with photographed records of the diagrams.

- Detailed methodology and workshop structure (Maputo and Xai-Xai)
  - Each workshop comprised two parts: building the BBN and constructing scenarios.
  - Participants divided into three groups ( Maputo: Manica, Niassa, National policies; Xai-Xai: three random groups).
  - Data collection decisions:
    - Maputo: no audio recording initially due to concerns about inhibiting discussion; post-workshop reflection on the decision.
    - Xai-Xai: audio recording implemented with participant consent; more comprehensive discussion capture.
  - Note-taking challenges noted; recommendation to assign consistent, trained note-takers integrated with the ACES team for full-day coverage.

- Detailed timetable highlights (Maputo and Xai-Xai)
  - Structure across the day:
    - Opening: agenda, participant introductions, research questions, and proposal feedback.
    - Core activity: building the BBN with groups identifying main variables related to rural well-being and ecosystem services; group voting to prioritize variables.
    - Cross-linking: each group adds ecosystem services associations and factors influencing services.
    - Breaks for tea/coffee and lunch.
    - Afternoon: continuation of BBN construction, followed by group presentation of the three BBNs.
    - Final plenary to identify missing elements and conclude.
  - Maputo specifics: schedule included explicit steps for presenting research questions, defining boundaries, and timescales (2–20 years), with notes on areas for improved participation.
  - Xai-Xai specifics: similar structure with explicit cross-group comparisons displayed on screens to contrast voting outcomes.

- Key takeaways for data support and practical application
  - A clear process to convert qualitative workshop data into actionable causal diagrams and future quantitative models (BBNs).
  - Emphasis on capturing stakeholder perspectives, service relationships, and mechanisms linking wellbeing to land use and ecosystem services.
  - Importance of robust data capture practices (consistent note-taking, audio where appropriate, and full-day observer presence) to ensure usable, well-documented outputs.
  - Necessity of reframing complex concepts (BBN terminology) for participant accessibility to facilitate genuine participation.

- Recommendations for future work
  - Ensure dedicated, trained note-takers are present throughout all workshops; align with ACES fieldwork schedules.
  - Consider standardizing recording practices across all sites to enable richer qualitative data capture.
  - Continue developing a two-stage data product: (1) qualitative BBN diagrams for stakeholder understanding, (2) quantified BBNs populated with data collected in subsequent rounds.
