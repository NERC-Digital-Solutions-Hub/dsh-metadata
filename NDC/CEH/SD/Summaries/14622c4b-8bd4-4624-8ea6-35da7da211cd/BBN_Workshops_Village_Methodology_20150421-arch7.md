# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VILLAGE BBN WORKSHOPS

- Objective and context
  - ACES project on livelihoods and land use change in Mozambique; aim to construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change and well-being, using a participatory approach.
  - Document collects qualitative data from 20 workshops; data structured in seven .rtf files reporting national, provincial, and village results.

- Data structure and quality control
  - Data stored as uncompressed .rtf files with workshop results (ranging from small to large files).
  - Quality assurance conducted by two researchers who wrote, reviewed, and approved official results; multiple data collection methods used (notes, recordings with consent, photos of materials).

- Methodology overview
  - Village-scale workshops (8–15 villagers) to construct preliminary causal diagrams (BBNs) linking well-being, ecosystem services, forest use, and land use.
  - Output at village level: a qualitative causal diagram (variables and links, no quantitative data yet).
  - Integration: post-workshop integration across national, provincial, and village levels to develop an integrated BBN; next steps include collecting quantitative data and probabilistic links.

- Workshop outputs and workflow
  - Primary output: a village-specific causal diagram (2x3 metre paper) with visuals; no numbers yet.
  - Integrated process: compare national, provincial, and village diagrams; identify common variables; weight village-derived wellbeing variables more for direct relations and national/provincial variables for drivers and policies.
  - Iterative refinement: researchers, ACES team, and stakeholders review multiple times to converge on final structure.

- Workshop process and activities
  - Format: focus-group style, up to 2 hours; use large paper, pictures, and drawings to facilitate representation of variables and links.
  - Steps:
    - Brainstorm wellbeing components and explain wellbeing concept.
    - Participants select and rank key wellbeing factors; avoid excessive academic framing.
    - Link wellbeing components to ecosystem services and forest; add causal links and new variables as identified.
    - Discuss and propose actions or policies to improve wellbeing and conservation.
    - Facilitator summarizes and explains next steps; gather feedback.
  - Tools and outputs: large wall diagram, pictures/drawings representing variables, stacked links, and photos of the final diagrams.

- Village and participant selection
  - Villages chosen to cover a deforestation gradient; if logistics permit, include multiple sites; at minimum, extremes of the gradient to maximize variable diversity.
  - Participants: groups of about 8, aiming for balanced representation (4 women, 4 men; varied ages and occupations; avoid village chief if possible to reduce power dynamics).

- Facilitator role and training
  - Potential facilitators: skilled local language speakers or forestry technicians; preferably students with field experience to minimize influence.
  - Training: prior workshops to understand ACES goals, facilitation rules, and method; run 1–2 pilot workshops to refine the approach.

- Participatory rules and ethics
  - One person speaks at a time; data anonymized; all views considered equally important; workshop duration and purpose clearly explained.

- Logistics, equipment, and tasks
  - Essential items: facilitator (local language), large 2x3 m paper, stacking system for images, markers, recording gear, photo/compilation equipment, scissors, and participant refreshments.
  - Coordination tasks: align with WP2 and WP3; ensure participant recruitment and village contact.

- Information to be used during workshops
  - Clear rules and agenda including wellbeing component brainstorming, ranking, linking to ecosystem services, identifying policy actions, and a final summary/evaluation.
  - Comprehensive lists provided for wellbeing components and ecosystem services to guide discussion (e.g., access to water, health, education; firewood, charcoal, land for machamba, timber, medicinal plants, etc.).

- Outputs and next steps
  - Village-level BBNs completed as conceptual diagrams; national/provincial/village integrated BBN developed later.
  - In the following winter, collect quantitative data to populate states and probabilities; stakeholder feedback continues to refine the model.
  - Final approach includes evaluating coherence across levels and adjusting structure with intermediate variables or links as needed.
