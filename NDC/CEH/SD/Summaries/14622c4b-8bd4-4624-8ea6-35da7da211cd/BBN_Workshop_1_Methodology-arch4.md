# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai Xai, 2014

## Overview
- Project: ACES: Livelihoods and Land Use Change in Mozambique; led by University of Edinburgh with partners (Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, etc.).
- Objective: Construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land-use change and its impact on rural well-being via a participatory approach.
- Outputs: Qualitative data from 20 workshops, aimed at building causal diagrams to inform a BBN structure for later quantitative data.

## Data structure
- Seven .rtf files house the workshop results:
  - National Maputo 2014
  - Province Xai Xai 2014
  - Province Lichinga 2015
  - Province Quelimane 2015
  - Village Mabalane 2014
  - Village Gurue 2015
  - Village Marrupa 2015

## Quality control
- Data collected through multiple formats: notes by 1–3 participants, recordings with participant consent, photographs of materials.
- Verification workflow: first draft written by one researcher, reviewed by a second participant-present writer, then final review and official approval.

## Development and implementation of the methodology
- Methodology crafted by the research team, informed by established references.
- Purpose: to construct causal diagrams linking land-use change and rural well-being; implemented with participants from Gaza province (Xai-Xai) and national-level stakeholders (Maputo).
- Iterative aim: use the diagrams to guide subsequent construction of a quantitative BBN and identify key variables and links.

## Objective of the workshops
- Core aim: map the main factors affecting rural well-being, their interrelations, and connections to ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
- Secondary aims: gather ideas for actions to support poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation; ensure broad inclusion of variables to avoid missing important factors; produce new knowledge and amplify stakeholder perspectives.

## Outputs
- Primary outputs: three causal diagrams per workshop (variables and links, not quantitative values).
- Next steps: construct a national/provincial/village BBN using workshop information; identify the most important variables and links for the definite BBN structure; later collect quantitative data to populate states and probabilities.
- Additional outputs: capture workshop discussions to understand stakeholder concerns and views.
- Format note: causal diagrams presented on large surfaces (2x3 metres) with variable cards; photos taken for records.

## Methodology in Maputo and Xai Xai
- Structure: two-part workshops—BBN construction and scenarios development.
- Grouping: three groups per workshop (e.g., Maputo: Manica, Niassa, National policies; Xai Xai: three randomly formed groups).
- Recording decision: Maputo not audio-recorded initially to avoid inhibiting discussion; Xai Xai recordings obtained with consent; eventual assessment found recording acceptable.
- Notes process: recognition of imperfect note-taking; recommendation for a dedicated, well-trained note-taker from the ACES team to capture main ideas, participant contributions, and discussion dynamics.

### Additional methodological considerations
- Terminology: “Bayesian belief networks” can be unfamiliar; the team used the term “Model” to ease understanding.
- Suggested operational improvements: assign a dedicated note-taker who participates in preparation; ensure staff are trained to record essential discussion elements (main ideas, contributors, discussion flow).

## Detailed timetable highlights (illustrative)
- Maputo:
  - Agenda presentation and participatory process overview.
  - Research questions and variables related to rural well-being, ecosystem services, and physical boundaries.
  - Group activities: identifying main well-being components, linking to ecosystem services, and drawing initial BBN relations.
  - Breaks and plenary sessions for presenting three group BBNs and identifying missing elements.
- Xai Xai:
  - Similar structure with emphasis on building BBNs across three groups and cross-group comparison.
  - Activities include voting on well-being components, identifying ecosystem services, drawing relations, and presenting the three BBNs.
  - Final plenary for missing elements and concluding remarks.

## Key implications for data leaders
- Structured qualitative-to-quantitative data pipeline: start with qualitative workshop outputs to define BBN structure, then populate with quantitative data later.
- Data governance and discoverability: organize outputs as clearly named, version-controlled files with metadata to support future data integration.
- Documentation and transparency: detailed methodological notes, recording decisions, and process recommendations to enable replication and auditing.
- Stakeholder engagement and co-ownership: participatory process fosters shared understanding of data products and their use in policy or planning contexts.
- Data quality and standardization: alignment of data collection, coding, and diagramming methods across sites to reduce variability and improve comparability.
- Practical workflow improvements: designate trained note-takers, consider recording all sessions, and maintain clear naming conventions to facilitate data reuse and collaboration.
