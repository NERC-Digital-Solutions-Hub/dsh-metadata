# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VILLAGE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Mabalane, Marrupa and Gurue Districts, 2015

- The ACES project (LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE) aimed to construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change and its effects on rural well-being using participatory processes.
- Lead and collaborators: University of Edinburgh, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and others; funded by ESPA (NERC/ESRC/DfID).
- Outputs to date: qualitative data from 20 workshops organized at national, provincial, and village levels to inform BBN structure and relationships between land use, ecosystem services (ES), and rural well-being.

## Data Structure and Quality Control

- Data base organized into seven .rtf files, each containing main results from workshops (e.g., national maputo 2014, provincial workshops 2014–2015, village workshops 2014–2015).
- Example files include:
  - BBN_Workshop_1_NationalMaputo_2014.rtf (Maputo, 2014)
  - BBN_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf
  - BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf
  - BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf
  - BBN_Workshops_Village_2014_Mabalane.rtf
  - BBN_Workshops_Village_2015_Gurue.rtf
  - BBN_Workshops_Village_2015_Marrupa.rtf
- Quality control processes:
  - Multiple note-takers during workshops; majority discussions recorded with participant consent.
  - Two writers produced initial results, then cross-checked by a second person; both attended workshops.
  - Final documents reviewed and approved as official results.

## Development and Implementation of the Methodology

- Objective: develop causal diagrams (BBNs) linking land use change and rural well-being; conduct village-scale workshops with 8–15 participants; work toward a national–provincial–village integrated BBN.
- Workshop design:
  - Focus group format to construct preliminary BBN/causal diagrams on well-being, ES, land use change, and management policies.
  - Data sources include surveys and discussions; emphasis on capturing a broad set of variables to avoid missing key drivers.
- Output pathway:
  - Village causal diagrams (one per village) containing variables and links (qualitative, no quantitative probabilities yet).
  - Integrated BBN to be built from national, provincial, and village diagrams; subsequent winter data collection to populate with quantitative states and probabilities.
  - Stakeholder review and iterative refinements across levels to converge on a final BBN structure.

## Outputs, Timetable, and Integration

- Primary outputs:
  - Village-level causal diagrams (2x3 metre large diagrams with pictures/drawings).
  - An integrated BBN combining national, provincial, and village variables and links; later populated with quantitative data.
- Next steps:
  - Collect quantitative data to populate the BBN states and link probabilities (planned for the following winter).
  - Present the integrated structure to provincial stakeholders for evaluation and adjustments.
  - Iterative review cycles among ACES team, researchers, and stakeholders to finalize the BBN.
- Integration approach:
  - Compare national, provincial, and village diagrams to identify common and unique variables.
  - Prioritize village-level wellbeing variables and policy/policy-driver variables from national/provincial levels.
  - Adjust the network by adding/removing intermediate variables and validating with stakeholders.

## Selection and Organization of Workshops

- Village selection:
  - Prefer villages along the deforestation gradient to capture diverse variables; if limited, select extremes to maximize variable representation.
  - Include national and provincial workshops to ensure coverage beyond the village level.
- Participant selection:
  - Target groups of about 8 participants to maximize participation and avoid dominance or disengagement.
  - Aim for representativeness: mix of genders, ages, and occupations; avoid single-leader dominance (e.g., village chiefs) where possible.
- Facilitator role:
  - Favor local language-speaking facilitators with field experience (e.g., students involved in WP2/3 or forestry technicians).
  - Training planned prior to workshops; conduct pilot sessions to refine methods.
  - An official presence can add credibility, but direct facilitation should remain with the trained facilitator to preserve free participant input.

## Participatory Rules and Workshop Practice

- Good participatory rules:
  - One person speaks at a time; data is anonymous; all opinions matter; duration around 1.5–2 hours.
- Workshop processes:
  - Introduction and explanation of wellbeing concepts; examples of ecosystem services (e.g., construction materials, medicinal plants, wild fruits).
  - Participants brainstorm wellbeing components, then select and rank the most important.
  - Link wellbeing components to ecosystem services and to forest/community dynamics; construct causality links on large paper diagrams (2x3 metres).
  - Discuss potential actions or policies to improve wellbeing and forest conservation.
  - Facilitator provides a synthesis and evaluates the workshop; where possible, present the village’s “white paper” results and discuss next steps.
- Information materials provided to participants:
  - Summary of participatory rules and workshop agenda.
  - List of wellbeing components to prompt discussion (covering basic needs, social relations, governance, land access, etc.).
  - List of ecosystem services to discuss and prioritize (e.g., firewood, charcoal, land for machambas, medicine, timber, etc.).
  - Final discussion prompts addressing actions, soil fertility, pasture practices, land conflicts, and machamba management.

## Practical Considerations for Analysts

- Data culture and reuse:
  - Emphasis on capturing a broad, representative set of variables to enable robust cross-level comparisons and future quantitative modeling.
  - The integrated BBN approach supports scenario analysis of policy interventions and forest-management strategies.
- Data quality and transparency:
  - Qualitative outputs are structured as diagrams and explanatory notes; later steps will inject quantitative data to enable probabilistic reasoning.
  - Iterative stakeholder feedback ensures the model remains relevant to on-the-ground realities and policy needs.

## Key Concepts and Variables Highlighted

- Wellbeing components: core factors affecting livelihoods, health, housing, education, safety, social relations, and access to resources.
- Ecosystem services (ES) of focus: firewood, charcoal, hunting, pastures, land for machambas, construction materials, medicinal plants, wild foods, and forest-derived inputs.
- Links and causality: diagrams depict how forest availability, ES, and land-use changes influence household wellbeing and how policy actions might alter these relationships.

- The project positions the village workshops as essential input nodes to an overarching, policy-relevant BBN framework designed to monitor environmental health and inform poverty alleviation and forest-conservation strategies over time.
