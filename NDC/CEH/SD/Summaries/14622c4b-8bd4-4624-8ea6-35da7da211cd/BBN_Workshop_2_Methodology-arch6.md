# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015

## Purpose and scope
- Objective: construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change in rural Mozambique using a participatory approach, incorporating qualitative data from 20 workshops.

## Data structure
- Data stored in seven .rtf files reporting workshop results (Maputo 2014; Xai Xai 2014; Lichinga 2015; Quelimane 2015; Mabalane 2014; Marrupa 2015).
- Files contain results as qualitative content; no quantitative data in diagrams.
- Data capture included notes by 1–3 people, post-workshop discussions recorded with participant consent, and photos of materials for readability and interpretation.

## Quality control
- Data collected in varied ways and formats; notes taken by multiple people; discussions recorded with consent; presentations and plenaries photographed.
- Two individuals drafted the results; both attended workshops, then reviewed and approved final outputs as official results.

## Objective and outputs
- Objectives:
  - Capture wellbeing components and their relationships to ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
  - Elicit ideas for actions to alleviate poverty and conserve biodiversity.
  - Include as many relevant variables as possible, then distill to the most important ones.
  - Gather stakeholder input to construct a relevant BBN for Marrupa and assess how interventions could influence land use.
- Outputs:
  - Three causal diagrams per working group (on large 2x3 metre sheets) showing variables and links (no quantitative data yet).
  - A table linking interventions to land-use categories with the most probable impacts.
  - A record of workshop discussions to reflect stakeholder concerns, understandings, and diverse views.

## Methodology and Agenda
- Timeline:
  - Pilot Workshop in Edinburgh (29 June) and Maputo preparation (25–27 July 2015).
  - Provincial workshops in Lichinga (04–05 Aug 2015) and Quelimane (28–29 Oct 2015).
- Structure:
  - Each provincial workshop had two parts: scenarios (Day 1) and BBN/causal diagram work (Day 2).
  - Participants were divided into three groups to ensure broad representation of interests.
  - Most sessions audio recorded where participants consented; plenary discussions and group results were recorded; outputs were photographed.
  - To reduce unfamiliarity with the term BBN, they used “causal diagrams” or models.
- Agenda overview:
  - Day 2: sessions on effects of spatial data on scenarios; introduction to causal diagrams; group work on wellbeing components, ecosystem services, and main activities (subsistence agriculture, tobacco farming, charcoal production); identifying interventions; assessing effects on land use; group reports and final conclusions.

## Workshop methodology followed
- Participants worked in three groups focused on key local productive activities (subsistence agriculture, tobacco agriculture, charcoal production) identified as major drivers of woodland loss.
- Process steps:
  - Each participant voted for the eight most important wellbeing components; groups selected four that related to ecosystem services.
  - Components were linked to ecosystem services; activities were linked to these services; interventions were proposed to improve activity performance and reduce negative land-use impacts.
- Output format: construction of large causal diagrams on paper; facilitator assistance to build the diagrams and interconnections; discussion and interpretation among groups.

## Session on effects of interventions on land use change (2.1)
- Three groups identified six interventions each and estimated their impact on land use change (in percent) using an A0 matrix with land-use categories.
- Groups presented their diagrams and discussed differences; concluded with a synthesis and a basic explanation of the BBN concept.

## Participating institutions
- Lichinga (Aug 2015) included a broad set of local organizations and institutions (examples: UP-Niassa, ORAM-Niassa, UN Lúrio, We Effect, DPA-Niassa, Eco Turismo, WWF-Niassa, ACES, etc.).
- Quelimane (Oct 2015) included provincial science and technology institutions, universities, DPA SPFFB, AMAVA/FONGA, SDAE, ITC Zambézia, SPFFB, Hoyo-Hoyo, UNIZAMBEZE, and other partners.
