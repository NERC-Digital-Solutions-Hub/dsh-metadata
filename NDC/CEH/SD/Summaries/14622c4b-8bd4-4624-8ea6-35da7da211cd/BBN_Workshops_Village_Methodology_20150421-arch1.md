# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VILLAGE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Mabalane, Marrupa and Gurue Districts, 2015

- Objective and scope
  - Build Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change and its impact on rural well-being in Mozambique.
  - Use a participatory approach across village, provincial, and national levels to capture local knowledge and drivers of change.
  - Produce qualitative data (causal diagrams) first, then develop a quantitative BBN with probabilities in a subsequent step.
  - Output informs poverty alleviation and forest conservation policies; findings may be used by government, with iterative stakeholder feedback.

- Data structure
  - Qualitative data from 20 workshops contained in seven .rtf files (National Maputo 2014; two provincial workshops 2014/2015; two provincial workshops 2015; three village workshops 2014–2015).
  - Files document main results and causal links linking land use change, ecosystem services, and rural well-being.

- Quality control
  - Data collected via multiple methods: field notes (1–3 people), consent-based recordings, and photo documentation of materials.
  - Two researchers wrote and cross-checked the workshop results; final documents approved as official project results.

- Development and implementation of the methodology
  - Methodology developed by ACES team to construct causal diagrams linking land use change and rural well-being; villages used as the scale of the initial workshops.
  - Workshops engaged 8–15 villagers per session; participant details are documented in each file.
  - Primary data sources: surveys, interviews, and focus groups to capture wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and management policies.
  - Aim to identify a broad set of variables first, with researchers selecting the most important later.
  - Output path: village-level causal diagrams → provincial/national integration → integrated BBN; subsequent quantitative data collection to populate probabilities and states.
  - Integration is iterative: compare national, provincial, and village BBNs, identify common variables, and refine structure through stakeholder feedback.

- Output and workflow
  - Outputs include: a village-level causal diagram (variables and links, no quantitative data yet) and an integrated, multi-level BBN.
  - In the following winter, fill the BBN with quantitative data (state definitions and probabilities).
  - Stakeholder workshops at the province level review and provide feedback on the integrated BBN.

- Selection of villages and participants
  - Villages selected along the deforestation gradient to maximize variable capture; if logistics limit, extremes along the gradient are chosen.
  - Preference for 2–3 village workshops to ensure coverage of fundamental variables; national and provincial workshops are also conducted.
  - Participant composition: up to 8 individuals per workshop, balanced gender and age representation, varied occupations (farmers, herders, charcoal producers, traders, etc.), with caution to avoid the village chief to encourage open participation.
  - Target distribution example: 4 women and 4 men, including young and older participants, from diverse livelihoods.

- Facilitator and participatory rules
  - Facilitator options: local language-speaking facilitator (e.g., a trained field student) or a forestry technician; students may cause less preconception; government official presence is acceptable but not as active facilitator.
  - Facilitator training: review project aims, facilitation rules, and conduct pilot workshops to refine the method.
  - Good participatory rules: only one person speaks at a time; data anonymized; all views valued; session duration about 1.5–2 hours.
  - Emphasis on inclusive participation and clear guidance to keep discussions productive.

- To do (logistics and coordination)
  - Identify and coordinate with WP2&3; designate facilitators.
  - Prepare introductions, participant rounds, and clear explanations of objectives and confidentiality.
  - Develop simple, general prompts to guide discussion and ensure structured input.

- Workshop introduction and flow
  - Introduction explains objective: identify main wellbeing components and their link to ecosystem services; discuss potential policies for poverty alleviation and conservation; clarify that results inform government recommendations, not direct village interventions.
  - Step-by-step flow (approximately 1.5–2 hours):
    - Brainstorm wellbeing components and introduce the concept of wellbeing.
    - Have participants select the most important components (aim to identify a set, e.g., top 6).
    - Determine links between wellbeing components and ecosystem services/forest and land use.
    - Add relevant variables and illustrate causal links; participants may draw links or have facilitators illustrate.
    - Discuss potential actions or policies to improve wellbeing and forest management.
    - Facilitator provides a summary and conducts an oral evaluation; consider sharing the workshop’s “white paper” results with participants.
  - Emphasis on capturing new variables through group interaction and ensuring the diagram reflects participants’ reality.

- Information to be used during the workshops
  - Participatory rules summary (anonymity, one speaker at a time, importance of all opinions, duration).
  - Agenda for village BBN workshop:
    - Brainstorm wellbeing components and discuss their meaning.
    - Rank the six most important components.
    - Link wellbeing components to nature and ecosystem services; explain causality.
    - Add key variables and links; discuss potential actions or policies.
  - Wellbeing components list (examples): freedom, food security, housing quality, health, education, water access, protection from hazards, energy, livelihoods, social relations, land access, etc.
  - Ecosystem services to discuss (examples): firewood, charcoal, hunting, cattle pastures, land for machambas, construction materials, medicinal plants, wild foods, timber, sacred places, forest resources.
  - Additional final discussion prompts cover forest quality for construction materials and firewood, soil fertility practices, pasture management, land conflicts, and farming inputs.

- Outputs and future steps
  - Immediate outputs: village-level causal diagrams with variables and links (no quantitative data yet).
  - Next steps: compile an integrated multi-level BBN; conduct quantitative data collection to populate variable states and link probabilities; present and refine with stakeholders across national and provincial levels.

- Key references and methodological grounding
  - Method draws on participatory Bayesian network approaches (e.g., Chan et al., 2010) and established social research methods (Bryman, 2012) to guide participatory diagram construction and stakeholder engagement.
