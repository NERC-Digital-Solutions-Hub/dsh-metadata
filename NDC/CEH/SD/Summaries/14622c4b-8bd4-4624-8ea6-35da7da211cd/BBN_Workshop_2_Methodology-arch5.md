# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015

- The document describes the methodology, data structures, quality control, and workshop processes used to develop Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) for modeling future land use change in rural Mozambique, based on 20 participatory workshops conducted in 2015 (Lichinga and Quelimane) as part of the ACES project.

## Data and structure

- Data produced: qualitative data from 20 workshops, intended to inform BBNs linking land use, ecosystem services, and rural well-being.
- Data storage structure: seven .rtf files reporting main results:
  - Examples include BBN_Workshop_1_NationalMaputo_2014.rtf, BBN_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf, BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf, BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf, BBN_Workshops_Village_2014_Mabalane.rtf, BBN_Workshops_Village_2015_Marrupa.rtf.
- File sizes are noted, indicating uncompressed textual results; no quantitative data were included in these outputs.

## Quality control and provenance

- Data collection varied in format (notes by 1–3 people; post-workshop discussions recorded with participant consent; photographs of materials).
- Two staff members authored each document: one initial draft, followed by review by a second person who attended the workshops; final validation as project results.
- Participant consent was obtained for recording discussions; meetings and plenaries were audio-recorded where consent permitted, and plenary presentations were recorded.
- Visual documentation included photographs of workshop outputs to support interpretation.

## Methodology development and objectives

- Methodology built from team expertise and referenced sources to construct causal diagrams linking land use change and rural well-being; designed for representation of diverse stakeholder views across Niassa (Lichinga) and Zambezia (Quelimane).
- Primary objectives:
  - Capture factors influencing well-being and their relation to ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
  - Elicit stakeholder ideas on actions that could support poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
  - Ensure comprehensive variable coverage, then distill to the most important variables.

## Workshop aims and outputs

- Objective details:
  - Collect stakeholder input to construct a relevant and representative BBN for Marrupa district.
  - Gather perspectives on how interventions might influence land use change.
- Outputs produced:
  - Three causal diagrams per working group (on A0-sized sheets, 2x3 meters) displaying variables and connections, with photos captured at workshop end.
  - A table linking interventions to land use categories, indicating probable impacts.
  - A qualitative record of workshop discussions to capture stakeholder concerns, understandings, and diverse views.

## Agenda and process (high-level)

- Preparation and pilot:
  - Pilot workshop in Edinburgh (June 29) and Maputo (July 27); preparation in Maputo (July 25).
- Provincial workshops (two days each):
  - Day 1: Scenarios workshop.
  - Day 2: Bayesian/causal diagram workshop.
- Participant grouping:
  - Three groups per workshop, ensuring broad representation of interests.
- Data capture:
  - Audio recordings of plenary and many group presentations; some group discussions not recorded due to participant reluctance.
  - Note-takers documented group outputs and presentations; photographs of group outputs were taken.
- Notion used to communicate BBN results:
  - To ease understanding, “Bayesian belief networks” were referred to as “causal diagrams” or models in communications with participants.

## Session on effects of interventions on land use change

- Structure:
  - Three groups focused on key local activities driving land use change: subsistence agriculture, tobacco farming, charcoal production.
  - Each group selected the six most important interventions from prior exercises and estimated the intervention effects on land use change (percent changes) using an A0 matrix.
- Outcome sharing:
  - Groups presented their causal diagrams and land-use impact estimates, followed by cross-group discussion.
- Final reflections:
  - Concluding session summarized workshop findings and provided a basic, illustrative example of BBN structure for context.

## Participants and institutions

- Lichinga workshop (4–5 August 2015) participants included:
  - Multiple local and regional organizations (e.g., UP-Niassa, ORAM-Niassa, UN Lúrio, We Effect, DPA Niassa, WWF Niassa, ACES, etc.).
- Quelimane workshop (28–29 October 2015) participants included:
  - Provincial/district entities and academic or non-governmental partners (e.g., DP Ciência e Tecnologia Zambézia, ITC Zambézia, SPFFB, UNIZAMBEZE, IIAM Zambezia, APAMAZ, ORAM Zambézia, etc.).
- Overall, workshops involved a broad, multi-stakeholder set of institutions representing government, research, civil society, and local communities.

## Timeline and key moments

- Lichinga workshop: 04/08/2015.
- Quelimane workshop: 28–29/10/2015.
- Ancillary activities: pilot workshop in Maputo; Edinburgh pilot; facilitator preparation in Maputo.

## Relevance to Data Stewards

- Governance and standards:
  - Documentation of data provenance, collection methods, and validation processes supports data governance and traceability.
  - Clear role delineation for data authors and verifiers enhances data quality assurance.
- Metadata and formats:
  - Data described as seven RTf files with explicit naming conventions; recorded formats and sizes support metadata interpretation and reuse considerations.
- Data quality and usability:
  - Mixed methods data (notes, audio recordings, photos) with explicit consent handling; structured outputs (causal diagrams and intervention tables) provide reusable qualitative evidence for BBN modeling.
- Data sharing and stewardship implications:
  - Although not describing a formal data repository, the documentation demonstrates practices relevant to sharing qualitative workshop results, including assembling outputs for potential incorporation into broader data catalogs and planning for future reuse in Bayesian network modeling.
