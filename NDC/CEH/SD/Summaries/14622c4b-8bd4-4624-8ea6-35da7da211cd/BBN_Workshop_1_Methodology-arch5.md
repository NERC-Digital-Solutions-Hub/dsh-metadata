# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai Xai, 2014

## Overview
- Project objective: construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change and rural well-being in Mozambique using a participatory approach.
- Collaborators: University of Edinburgh (lead), Universidad Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and others; funded by ESPA (NERC/ESRC/DfID).
- Data produced: qualitative data from 20 workshops; intended to inform BBN structure and later populate with quantitative data.

## Data assets and structure
- Data base comprises seven .rtf files reporting workshop results:
  - BBN_Workshop_1_NationalMaputo_2014.rtf
  - BBN_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf
  - BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf
  - BBN_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf
  - BBN_Workshops_Village_2014_Mabalane.rtf
  - BBN_Workshops_Village_2015_Gurue.rtf
  - BBN_Workshops_Village_2015_Marrupa.rtf
- Data capture methods: notes taken during workshops (1–3 people), post-discussion transcripts with participant consent, photos of materials.
- File details: uncompressed sizes ranging from a few hundred KB to about 20 KB per file; descriptive content includes workshop outcomes, variables, and links.

## Quality control and data provenance
- Data preparation process: two-person drafting (one initial draft, another review) by individuals present at workshops; final approvals recorded as official results.
- Quality issues identified:
  - In Maputo, no audio recording due to concerns about discussion dynamics; later acknowledgment that recording was not problematic.
  - Note-taking gaps due to fieldwork workload; recommendations for dedicated, trained note-taker familiar with ACES fieldwork.
- Documentation practices: terminology adjustment (BBN often referred to as “Model” for accessibility); emphasis on capturing main ideas, speakers, and discussion flow rather than verbatim repetition.

## Methodology and outputs
- Core methodology: use BBNs to connect variables related to rural well-being, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land use.
- Outputs per workshop:
  - Three causal diagrams (BBNs) illustrating variables and links (without quantitative data).
  - Plans to construct a definitive BBN from national, provincial, and village workshop data, then populate with quantitative data in a subsequent step.
  - Documentation of stakeholder concerns, understandings, and diverse views from participants.
- Format and visualization: causal diagrams produced on large sheets (2x3 meters) with variables and connections; photographs taken for records.
- Future data steps: collect quantitative data (possible states and probabilities) in the next winter; aim to identify the most important variables and meaningful links.

## Workshop logistics and data implications
- Locations and timing: Maputo (national level and Maputo province) and Xai Xai (Gaza province) workshops held on 13–14 August 2014.
- Structure: two-part sessions—BBN construction and scenario construction; participants divided into three groups (A-National, B-Niassa, C-Manica in Maputo; three groups in Xai Xai with random assignment).
- Activities:
  - Research questions and variables: focus on rural well-being, ecosystem services, and boundary definitions (districts, timescales up to 20 years).
  - Group exercises: identification and voting on key well-being components; mapping of ecosystem services to components; drafting relationships between variables.
  - Presentations: each group presents its BBN; discussion on missing elements and consolidation of insights.
- Data governance considerations for reuse:
  - Dataset currently comprises qualitative workshop results; plan to integrate into a quantitative BBN in the future.
  - Important to document context (locations, groups, questions asked) to support reproducibility and reuse.
  - Standardization opportunities highlighted: harmonizing variable naming, relationships, and documentation across workshops to ease interoperability.

## Data governance and best practices for data stewards
- Storage and formats: seven .rtf files representing workshop outputs; consider migrating to open, interoperable formats and attaching rich metadata.
- Metadata and provenance: capture context (workshop date, location, group composition, recording status, consent), variable definitions, and linkages to ensure interpretability.
- Versioning and updates: establish a process for updating BBN structures as new data (quantitative states and probabilities) are collected; maintain original qualitative records for context.
- Sharing and access: ensure that the dataset can be discovered and reused by others, with clear access guidance and licensing; preserve documentation of data collection methods and assumptions.
- Data quality improvements: implement dedicated note-taking and data capture roles; standardize terminology (e.g., explicit use of “BBN” vs. “Model”) to support clarity and reuse across projects.
- Ethical and consent considerations: note the use of participant consent for transcripts and recordings (explicitly recorded in Xai Xai); maintain records of consent and any anonymization steps as data are reused.
