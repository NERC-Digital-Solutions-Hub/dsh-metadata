# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai Xai, 2014 Pedro Zorrilla-Miras 2014 ACES: LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE WP 1 AND 5

## 1. Introduction
- ACES project aimed to construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change and rural well-being in Mozambique using a participatory approach.
- Qualitative data from 20 workshops are included in the database.
- Collaborating institutions: University of Edinburgh (lead), Universidad Mondlane, IIED, and other partners; funded by ESPA (NERC/ESRC/DfID).

## 2. Data structure
- seven .rtf files report the main results of the 20 workshops:
  - Maputo 2014 national workshop
  - Xai Xai 2014 provincial workshop
  - Lichinga 2015 provincial workshop
  - Quelimane 2015 provincial workshop
  - Mabalane 2014 village workshop
  - Gurue 2015 village workshop
  - Marrupa 2015 village workshop

## 3. Quality control
- Data collected in varied formats: notes by 1–3 people, some audio recordings (with consent), photos of materials.
- Data writing process: two people draft, both present at workshops, final review and approval by both as official results.

## 4. Development and implementation of the methodology
- Methodology developed by the research team guided by prior references.
- Purpose: build causal diagrams linking land use change and rural wellbeing; workshops engaged diverse stakeholders at provincial and national levels.

## 5. Objective of the workshops
- Capture key factors influencing wellbeing and their relationships to ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
- Elicit potential actions for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
- Aim to include as many relevant variables as possible, then identify the most important variables in later steps.
- Outputs include new knowledge, stakeholders’ concerns, and diverse perspectives.

## 6. Output
- Three causal diagrams produced per workshop (variables and links, no quantitative data).
- Plan to construct a final BBN from National, Provincial, and Village workshop information; select key variables and meaningful links to define the BBN structure.
- Next step (winter): collect quantitative data to populate the BBN (states of variables, probabilities of links).
- Additional output: capture workshop discussions to understand stakeholder positions and viewpoints.
- Diagram format: a large piece of paper (2x3 meters) with variables on paper pieces and connecting lines; final workshop photos taken for records.

## 7. Methodology finally used in Maputo and Xai Xai
- Dates: Maputo (13 August) and Xai Xai (14 August) – two-day workshops.
- Structure: two parts—BBN construction and scenarios; participants divided into three groups (Maputo: Manica, Niassa, National policies; Xai Xai: random groups).
- Recording approach:
  - Maputo: not audio-recorded (to avoid inhibiting discussion); later realization that recording could have been acceptable.
  - Xai Xai: audio recording conducted.
  - After sessions: decision to record discussed and implemented.
- Note-taking issues: partial success due to ACES fieldwork demands; recommendation to assign a dedicated, well-trained note-taker for each group who records main ideas, who contributed each idea, discussion flow, etc. Recommends ensuring notes reflect discussion processes rather than repetitions.
- Terminology: to ease acceptance, “Model” used instead of “Bayesian belief networks.”

### 7.1 Detailed timetable (Maputo)
- 8:30–9:00: agenda presentation; participatory process overview; invitation for feedback.
- 9:00–10:30: building the BBN with three groups; identifying main wellbeing components; linking ecosystem services.
- 10:30–11:00: tea/coffee break.
- 11:00–12:40: continue building BBN; actions to impact variables; draft relationships.
- 12:40–13:15: lunch.
- 13:15–16:00: finalize group BBNs; present three BBNs (5 minutes each); discuss missing elements; conclude.

### 7.2 Detailed timetable (Xai Xai)
- 9:30–9:45: agenda and participatory process overview.
- 9:45–10:00: feedback on research questions and indicators (wellbeing, woodland cover, ecosystem services).
- 10:00–11:00: building the BBN; top wellbeing components identified; related ecosystem services added; define boundaries and timescale.
- 11:00–11:30: tea/coffee break.
- 11:30–12:30: further development (ecosystem services per component, determinants of services).
- 12:30–13:15: lunch.
- 13:15–16:00: continue building BBN; discuss actions; 3 groups present their BBNs (5 minutes each); identify missing elements; final plenary and remarks.
