# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai Xai, 2014

## Overview
- The ACES project aimed to construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change and its impact on rural well-being in Mozambique using participatory workshops.
- The database compiles qualitative data from 20 workshops across national, provincial, and village levels.
- Lead institutions: University of Edinburgh (with Uni of Maputo, IIED, among others); funded by ESPA/NERC/ESRC/DfID.
- Outputs focus on generating causal diagrams and stakeholder perspectives to inform a subsequent quantitative BBN.

## Data structure
- Data stored in seven .rtf files, each representing workshop results:
  - National Maputo 2014
  - Province Xai Xai 2014
  - Province Lichinga 2015
  - Province Quelimane 2015
  - Village Mabalane 2014
  - Village Gurue 2015
  - Village Marrupa 2015
- File sizes range from hundreds to over twenty thousand kilobytes, reflecting qualitative workshop results.

## Quality control
- Data collected via multiple methods: notes by 1–3 scribes, audio recordings (context-dependent), and photographs of materials.
- Two team members drafted and then reviewed workshop results; both were present in the workshops.
- Acknowledgement that note-taking varied in completeness; recommendation to assign a dedicated, well-trained note-taker from the ACES team for future sessions.
- Use of the term “Model” instead of “BBN” to ease participant familiarity.

## Development and implementation of the methodology
- Methodology derived from team expertise and existing references; designed to link land use change with rural well-being via causal diagrams.
- Workshops engaged diverse stakeholders from different provincial interests (Maputo national focus; Xai Xai for Gaza province).
- Goals included capturing a broad set of variables, identifying relationships between wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses, and generating actionable knowledge for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.

## Objective of the workshops
- Main aim: understand key factors influencing rural well-being and how they interrelate with ecosystem services and land uses.
- Secondary aims: explore possible actions to improve wellbeing and biodiversity, ensure broad variable inclusion to avoid missing important drivers, and elicit stakeholder concerns and perspectives.

## Output
- Produce three causal diagrams per workshop (variables and links, without quantitative data).
- Use these diagrams to construct a national/provincial/village-informed BBN structure; later fill with quantitative data (states and probabilities).
- Collect workshop discussions to capture stakeholder insights, understandings, and differing views.
- Output format: large, two-by-three-metre sheets with variables on posted pieces of paper and connecting lines; photos taken of each sheet.

## Methodology used in Maputo and Xai Xai
- Timetable detail: workshops took place on 13–14 August 2014, split into two parts—BBN construction and scenario development.
- Participant grouping: Maputo used three groups (Manica, Niassa, National policies); Xai Xai used random groupings.
- Recording decisions: Maputo sessions not audio-recorded to preserve free discussion; Xai Xai sessions recorded with permission.
- Note-taking lessons: need for continuous presence of a dedicated note-taker for each group; better training on capturing main ideas, speaker attribution, and discussion processes.
- Terminology: “Model” was used to reduce unfamiliarity with Bayesian belief networks.

### Maputo (detailed timetable snapshot)
- Early sessions focused on agenda, participant introductions, and presenting the research questions and variables of interest (rural well-being, woodland cover/biodiversity, ecosystem services).
- Activities included prioritizing wellbeing components, mapping ecosystem services to components, and identifying factors influencing ecosystem services.
- Afternoon sessions progressed to building the BBN, linking variables, and conducting group discussions to propose actions and relationships.
- Final plenary session to present the three BBNs and discuss missing elements, followed by conclusions.

### Xai Xai (detailed timetable snapshot)
- Similar two-part structure: agenda presentation and research questions, followed by BBN construction.
- Emphasis on measuring rural well-being, defining physical boundaries, and establishing a timescale (3 districts with various years).
- Group activities mirrored Maputo: identifying key wellbeing components, linking ecosystem services, and drawing relationships to actions.
- Afternoon included comparison across groups, continued BBN development, and a final plenary with missing elements discussion and closing remarks.

## Key GIS-relevant takeaways
- The project demonstrates a structured, participatory approach to elicit qualitative relationships for spatially informed models of land use and well-being.
- Outputs are map-and-model oriented: large-format causal diagrams pave the way for a spatially aware BBN, with future integration of quantitative data for state probabilities.
- The framework addresses common GIS data challenges: integrating diverse stakeholder knowledge, handling multi-scale (national/provincial/village) viewpoints, and preparing data for subsequent quantitative modelling.
- Practical lessons include the importance of dedicated data-collection roles, clear documentation of discussion processes, and user-friendly terminology to facilitate participant engagement with Bayesian modelling concepts.
