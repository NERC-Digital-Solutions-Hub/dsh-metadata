# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BBN WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai Xai, 2014 Pedro Zorrilla-Miras 2014 ACES: LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE WP 1 AND 5

- Purpose and scope
  - Objective: construct Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to model future land use change scenarios in rural Mozambique using a participatory approach.
  - Focus: evaluate consequences of deforestation on rural well-being; incorporate qualitative data from 20 workshops.
  - Outputs aim to inform poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem service understanding.

- Data structure and sources
  - Data assembled by WP5 and WP1 of ACES; project led by University of Edinburgh with collaborators.
  - Seven .rtf files capture workshop results (Maputo national, Xai Xai provincial, Lichinga Quelimane, Mabalane, Gurue, Marrupa villages) totaling narrative workshop results.
  - Data collection methods varied: note-taking by 1–3 people, post-workshop transcription with participant consent, and photograph capture of materials.

- Quality control and data handling
  - Two-person writing process: one initial draft followed by review by a second person; both were present at workshops.
  - Some logistical challenges: Maputo not audio-recorded due to initial concerns about discussion dynamics; Xai Xai was recorded with consent.
  - Inconsistent note-taking due to fieldwork pressures; recommendation to have a dedicated, well-trained note-taker affiliated with the project for full-day coverage and training in capturing core ideas, discussion flow, who contributed ideas, etc.
  - Emphasis on describing discussion processes rather than duplicating every idea.

- Methodology development and implementation
  - Methodology developed from team expertise and relevant references to construct causal diagrams linking land-use change and rural well-being.
  - Participatory sessions conducted at multiple governance scales (national Maputo, provincial Xai Xai, and other local workshops) to elicit variables and links.
  - Output-oriented approach: start with qualitative causal diagrams, then build a final BBN once key variables and links are identified.

- Objectives of the workshops
  - Identify major factors influencing rural well-being and how they relate to ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
  - Elicit ideas for actions that could promote poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
  - Ensure comprehensive coverage of variables initially, then narrow to the most important ones; capture stakeholder concerns and diverse perspectives.

- Outputs and intended deliverables
  - Primary outputs: three causal diagrams (per workshop) showing variables and links, without quantitative data.
  - Next stage: construct a definitive BBN from national, provincial, and village workshop results; select the most important variables and meaningful links.
  - Subsequent data collection to populate the BBN with quantitative states and probabilities.
  - Additional outputs: capture stakeholder concerns and understandings from workshop discussions.
  - Format and scale: causal diagrams produced on large paper sheets (2x3 meters) with photos of each diagram for records.

- Structure of the workshops (Maputo and Xai Xai)
  - Maputo (National) and Xai Xai (Provincial) workshops conducted in August 2014.
  - Group composition: three groups (A-National, B-Niassa, C-Manica) with division by region.
  - Naming convention: “BBN” frequently referred to as “Model” to improve familiarity and acceptance among participants.
  - Recording practices: Maputo not audio-recorded initially; Xai Xai recorded after consent; notes occasionally incomplete due to fieldwork demands.
  - Recommendations: assign a single dedicated note-taker for full-day participation; ensure training on capturing essential discussion elements and participant authorship.

- Detailed timetable and flow of Maputo and Xai Xai workshops
  - Common agenda elements
    - Welcome, agenda presentation, and explanation of participatory process for BBN and scenarios.
    - Presentation of research questions and variables to impact (rural well-being; woodland cover and biodiversity; ecosystem services; physical boundaries; timescale considerations).
    - Group activities to identify main variables affecting rural well-being, followed by categorization of ecosystem services and their linkages.
    - Tea/coffee breaks and plenary sessions for cross-group comparison.
    - Building the BBN: groups discuss and draw relations among variables; they propose actions to influence outcomes.
    - Presentation of the three BBNs by group representatives; discussion of missing elements and final conclusions.
  - Maputo specifics
    - 2 groups plus a national group; focus on three districts and multiple timescales (0–20 years).
    - Early activity noted as less participatory than desired; more emphasis placed on improving engagement in subsequent activities.
  - Xai Xai specifics
    - Recording more consistently used; cross-group comparisons shown on screens during discussions.
    - Similar structure to Maputo with explicit notes on group dynamics and duplication of ideas.

- Key considerations and lessons for monitoring framework authors
  - Engagement and governance
    - Participatory, multi-stakeholder approach to identify meaningful indicators and causal relationships.
    - Clear communication about modeling terms (BBN vs. Model) to ease stakeholder acceptance.
  - Data and metadata
    - Qualitative workshop data require careful documentation and traceable provenance; future integration with quantitative data requires robust metadata standards.
  - Accessibility and transparency
    - Outputs designed to be transparent and accessible to participants, with mechanisms to share underlying discussions and relationships.
  - Practical deliverables
    - Early focus on qualitative causal diagrams to guide the development of a quantitative BBN.
    - Emphasis on capturing stakeholder views and concerns to inform policy-relevant monitoring frameworks.

- Endnotes and implementation considerations
  - The project anticipates transitioning from qualitative BBNs to quantitative population-level probabilities and states in subsequent work.
  - Lessons on logistics, recording, and data capture are highlighted to improve future monitoring framework workshops.
