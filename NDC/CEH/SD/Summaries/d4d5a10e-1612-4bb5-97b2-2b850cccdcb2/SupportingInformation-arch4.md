# Predicting and Understanding the Effectiveness of Measures to Mitigate Rural Diffuse Pollution

- Purpose and scope
  - Quantifies national emissions of nitrate, phosphorus, sediment and faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) for Scotland by integrating agricultural and non-agricultural pollutant modelling.
  - Compares outcomes with a prior Scotland model (SNIFFER Screen Tool) and validates results against observed data (OSPAR-COM, HMS) and greenhouse gas inventories.
  - Provides a spatially explicit framework linking farm-scale management to catchment- and river-mouth-scale outcomes, with emphasis on policy relevance and data-driven scenario analysis.

- Key national results (current practice)
  - Nitrate: total 73.3 kt; agriculture contributes over 80% of total; sewage works and woodland each around 7%.
  - Phosphorus: total 2.47 kt; agriculture contributes ~67%; sewage works ~18%.
  - Sediment: total high; agriculture dominates ~68%; bank erosion ~17%.
  - FIOs: agriculture contributes ~31%; sewage works ~46%; septic tanks ~21%.
  - Notes: differences from the SNIFFER Screening Tool arise from population-based versus discharge-specific assumptions and methodological choices (e.g., bank erosion, FracLeach factors).

- Greenhouse gases (nitrous oxide and methane)
  - Agriculture emissions: N2O ≈ 4,775 kt CO2-e; CH4 ≈ 3,154 kt CO2-e (current practice).
  - Relative shares: agriculture accounts for about 86% of national N2O and 55% of national CH4 emissions.
  - Total GHG implication: agriculture ≈ 3.1% of total CH4 and 4.8% of total N2O within Scotland’s overall GHG budget (53.9 Mt CO2-e total).
  - Methodology notes: adjusted IPCC-based calculations to reflect soil compaction, poaching, housing, and grazing; comparison with official inventories shows notable differences, especially indirect emissions via leaching.

- Spatial variation and sector apportionment
  - Nitrate patterns: higher in catchments with population-associated point sources (septic tanks, STWs); agriculture dominates in most inland catchments (50%+ in 91% of inland catchments; >90% in 45%).
  - Phosphorus patterns: western Scotland (high rainfall) and drained soils show stronger phosphorus losses; agriculture dominates in ~79% of inland catchments.
  - Sediment patterns: strong influence from rainfall and drainage; agriculture dominates in ~66% of inland catchments; bank erosion contributes a substantial portion to “other diffuse” loads.
  - FIOs: urban areas drive high loads; agriculture is dominant in many inland catchments but STWs/septic tanks also contribute significantly.
  - Overall, spatial patterns reflect farm type distribution, land use, soils, climate, and drainage, with agriculture often the leading contributor but non-agricultural sources important in many regions.

- Agricultural emissions by land use, farm type and pathways
  - Farm-type footprint: nine Robust Farm Types show dairy farms as major contributors to methane due to high stocking density and fertiliser use; arable land often shows high nitrate and sediment losses; lowland LA/LFA cattle and sheep have comparatively lower footprints.
  - Land-use differences: arable land drives higher nitrate (and sediment) losses; grassland contributes substantially to FIOs and methane; rough grazing differs by pathway and retains high nitrate via leaching in some cases.
  - Pathways and sources: 
    - Nitrate: soil stores and leaching dominate on arable land; significant contributions from fertiliser and excreta grazing.
    - Phosphorus: soil source dominates; surface runoff and drains contribute substantially (preferential flow pathways).
    - Sediment: surface runoff is dominant; drains and preferential flow are key on drained arable land.
    - FIOs: predominantly linked to grazing excreta; surface runoff is a major delivery pathway.
    - Methane: majority from enteric fermentation (especially cattle); non-field emissions (yards, housing) can be substantial for methane depending on management.
  - Non-field contributions: methane emissions show notable shares from yards, housing and manure storage; other pollutants are typically less dominated by non-field sources.

- Verification, calibration and data governance
  - Verification uses: 
    - OSPAR-COM data (nitrate, phosphorus, suspended solids) with a flow-based correction for organic matter to compare mineral sediment loads.
    - Behrendt and Opitz retention models for phosphorus and nitrate, and Vanoni for sediment, to adjust for in-channel retention.
    - Comparisons show good correlation for phosphorus (r2 ≈ 0.74) and nitrate (r2 ≈ 0.67), with more variability for sediment (r2 ≈ 0.41).
    - Faecal indicator organisms compared with Kay et al. (2008) and Tetzlaff et al. (2012) data; model tends to over-predict base-flow FIO loads relative to some observed datasets but preserves relative patterns across urbanization and land-use classes.
  - Data governance and accessibility (relevant to Data Leaders)
    - Integrates multiple national data sources (census, surveys, land cover, climate, soils, hydrology) into a cohesive modelling framework.
    - Some mitigation-action data are sensitive and not included in extracts; uptake, cost and efficacy data exist in appendices and full outputs.
    - Emphasises standardized, discoverable data assets and cross-agency collaboration to support data-driven modelling and policy design.
  - Implications for Data Leaders
    - Demonstrates a large-scale, spatially explicit data integration architecture linking farm-level management to watershed-scale outcomes.
    - Shows value of representative farm types to model policy impact while protecting confidentiality via statistical disaggregation.
    - Incorporates dynamic soil and hydrological modifiers (e.g., compaction, poaching, waterlogging) to reflect mitigation benefits.
    - Highlights data gaps and uncertainties (emission factors, bank erosion, connectivity) and the need for verification data and ongoing data quality improvements.
    - Provides a blueprint for a policy-relevant data framework that supports scenario analysis, monitoring alignment, and cross-sector collaboration.
