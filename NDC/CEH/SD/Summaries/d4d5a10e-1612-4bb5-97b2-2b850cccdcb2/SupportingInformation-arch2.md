# Predicting and Understanding the Effectiveness of Measures to Mitigate Rural Diffuse Pollution

- Overview
  - Presents national-scale estimates of nutrient, sediment, and faecal indicator organism (FIO) emissions for Scotland, partitioned by agriculture and other sectors.
  - Combines agricultural and non-agricultural sources to produce yearly emission totals; examines spatial patterns, sectoral contributions, and links to policy measures and mitigation uptake.
  - Uses a detailed farm-scale modelling framework and validation against observational data to support monitoring, scenario analysis, and policy evaluation.

- Key national emissions (current practice)
  - Nitrate (N): Agriculture dominates (Agriculture N = 60.07 kt; Total N = 73.28 kt). Other sources: STWs 4.95 kt, woodland 0.52 kt, septic tanks 0.17 kt, urban 1.43 kt, bank erosion 0.68 kt, etc.
  - Phosphorus (P): Agriculture also dominant (Agriculture P = 2.47 kt; Total P = 3.89 kt). STWs 0.76 kt; urban 0.17 kt; bank erosion 0.17 kt; woodland 0.25 kt; etc.
  - Sediment (Z): Agriculture dominates (Agriculture Z = 1,049 kt; Total Z = 1,685 kt). Bank erosion 339 kt; urban and other diffuse sources smaller by comparison.
  - Faecal Indicator Organisms (FIO, 10^15 cfu): Agriculture contributes 636 (10^15 cfu); STWs 922; septic tanks 425; urban 37; etc.
  - Comparison with earlier SNIFFER tool shows differences driven by source inclusions (e.g., bank erosion and STW discharge definitions) and methodology for FIOs and nitrate/phosphorus.

- Emissions by sector and pathway (5.1.2–5.1.3)
  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) from agriculture vs other sectors
    - Agriculture accounts for a large share of N2O and CH4 emissions (N2O: agriculture portion contributes most to Scotland’s total N2O; CH4 also dominated by agricultural sources but with notable contributions from non-agricultural sectors).
    - In the overall greenhouse gas budget, agriculture represents about 3.1% of total CH4 and 4.8% of total N2O (based on modeled agriculture emissions plus official non-agricultural inventories).
  - Spatial variation (nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment, FIOs)
    - Nitrate: other point sources (septic tanks, STWs) cluster along rivers in central/eastern Scotland; agricultural loads per hectare are higher, with agriculture dominant in most inland catchments (91% with >50% of total load; >90% in 45% of catchments).
    - Phosphorus: patterns similar to nitrate but more influenced by soil type and drainage; under-drained soils show higher P transfer; agriculture dominates in ~79% of inland catchments.
    - Sediment: other diffuse sources (e.g., bank erosion) contribute substantially in some catchments; agriculture dominates in ~66% of inland catchments.
    - FIOs: urban areas are key drivers; agriculture is dominant in 71% of inland catchments, but patterns differ from nitrate/phosphorus due to different source pathways.

- Agricultural emissions by farm type and land use (5.2)
  - Nine representative farm types (Robust Farm Types): Specialist Poultry, Cereals, General Cropping, Horticulture, Specialist Pigs, Dairy, Cattle & Sheep (Less Favoured Area), Cattle & Sheep (Lowland), Mixed.
  - Footprints (nitrate, phosphorus, sediment, FIOs, N2O, CH4) vary by land use
    - Dairy farms often have the highest footprints for most pollutants due to high stocking densities and fertiliser use.
    - Low-Input/FA (LFA) cattle & sheep tend to have lower footprints, reflecting less intensive management.
    - Arable land shows high nitrate and sediment footprints driven by drainage and erosion risk; rough grazing shows notable sediment and FIO contributions due to rainfall and land conditions.
  - Source and pathway apportionment
    - Nitrate: dominant soil losses on arable land (56%); fertiliser and excreta also important; surface vs. leaching pathways differ by land use.
    - Phosphorus: soil losses dominate (74%); surface runoff and drainage pathways are critical (near-equal split between runoff and preferential flow).
    - Sediment: surface runoff is a major pathway (about 56%); drainage/preferential flow important for arable lands.
    - FIOs: mainly from grazing excreta (around 95% of national FIO losses attributed to grazing in some summaries).
    - N2O: major sources in fertiliser and grazing excreta; methane: predominantly enteric (mostly from ruminants).
  - Non-field emissions (yards, housing, manure stores, tracks) generally smaller for most pollutants, except methane which is highly related to livestock location and movement.

- Verification and validation (Chapter 6)
  - 6.1.1 OSPAR-COM data: uses HMS network measurements (2006–2010) to compare model outputs for nitrate, phosphorus, and suspended solids; applies a correction factor to align modelled mineral sediment with measured total suspended solids (accounting for organic matter).
  - 6.1.2 In-channel retention: applies Behrendt and Opitz (phosphorus and nitrate) and Vanoni (sediment) retention models to estimate riverine delivery after in-channel processing.
  - 6.1.3 Comparison results
    - Phosphorus: good correlation (r^2 = 0.74); model generally under-predicts low loads and over-predicts high loads; agriculture dominant in most catchments (~40 of 56).
    - Nitrate: good correlation (r^2 = 0.67); agriculture dominant in all but a few catchments dominated by sewage works; some over-prediction in catchments with high measured loads.
    - Sediment: weaker correlation (r^2 = 0.41); over-predictions linked to areas with heavy rough grazing; some under-predictions in other areas.
  - Faecal indicator organisms (6.2)
    - Comparisons with Kay et al. (2008) and Tetzlaff et al. (2012) show general breadth of agreement but higher modelled loads in urban catchments; correlations indicate reasonable but imperfect predictive capacity for FIO dynamics and die-off.
  - Nitrous oxide and methane (6.3)
    - Model results are compared with official GHG inventories; impacts of soil compaction, poaching, and waterlogging increase N2O relative to inventory totals; differences largely arise from indirect emissions (leaching) assumptions and Scotland-specific management practices.
    - Overall, the project provides a framework to reconcile and decompose agricultural emissions with official inventories, including effects of mitigation actions.

- Data stewardship and monitoring relevance
  - Delivers spatially explicit, auditable pollutant loads by catchment, land use, and farm type to support monitoring, reporting, and policy evaluation over time.
  - Uses standardized data sources (census data, farm management datasets, land-use maps) and explicit data linking to output portals.
  - Provides a generalizable framework to connect process-based pollutant models with policy uptake and scenario analysis for diffuse pollution.

- Limitations and uncertainties
  - Emission factors (IPCC-based) carry wide uncertainties; Scotland-specific refinements help but residual uncertainty remains.
  - Bank erosion and some action descriptions are data-limited or confidential; certain action details are not fully disclosed in the extract.
  - Differences between model structure and official inventories (especially for indirect N2O from leaching) lead to discrepancies that require careful interpretation.

- Conclusion and access to full work
  - The extract outlines methodology, data framework, and modelling approach underpinning mitigation assessment for diffuse rural pollution; a full report provides additional mitigation action descriptions and future management scenarios.
  - The framework supports ongoing environmental monitoring and policy evaluation by delivering spatially explicit, auditable emissions estimates and responses to mitigation uptake.
