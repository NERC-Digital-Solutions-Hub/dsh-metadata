# Diffuse agricultural pollution to rivers in Scotland data

- Purpose: Provides a dataset to quantify diffuse agricultural pollution loads to rivers in Scotland, enabling monitoring of environmental policy effectiveness and informing future decisions; suitable for GIS analysis and integration into Water Framework Directive (WFD) catchment assessments.
- Data files: 
  - AgLoadsInland_Scotland.csv (inland catchments)
  - AgLoadsCoastal_Scotland.csv (coastal catchments)
- Key identifiers:
  - INLAND_ID: SEPA ID for inland catchments
  - COASTAL_ID: SEPA ID for coastal catchments
  - CATCH_ID: Unique WFD river catchment identifier
- Spatial linkage:
  - Data can be mapped to WFD catchments by joining the CSVs to WFD catchment polygons
  - WFD catchment dataset is not published by SEPA yet; SEPA plans to add it to its Environmental data page
- Land-use area data (hectares):
  - Arable_Are
  - Grass_area
  - Rough_Area
- Pollutant loads by land-use (per pollutant x land-use combination):
  - Arable_x, Grass_x, Rough_x, Other_x
  - x denotes pollutant
- Pollutants and units:
  - _P: kg total P per year
  - _N: kg NO3-N per year
  - _S: kg suspended solids per year
  - _F: 10^6 cfu per year
  - _N2O: kg N2O per year
  - _CH4: kg CH4 per year
  - cfu = colony forming units
- Data provenance and use:
  - Enables breakdown of loads by land-use type and pollutant for monitoring trends and evaluating mitigation measures
  - Supports aggregation at catchment scales (via CATCH_ID) for reporting and governance
