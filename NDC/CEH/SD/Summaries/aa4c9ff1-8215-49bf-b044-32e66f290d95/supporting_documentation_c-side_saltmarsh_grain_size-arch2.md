# Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE)

## Overview
- Project and funding: Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE); funded by NERC (NE/R010846/1).
- Data resource: grain size distributions from 459 soil samples collected across UK saltmarshes between 2018–2021.
- Purpose: provide a standardized environmental dataset to assess saltmarsh soil characteristics and support monitoring of environmental health and carbon storage.

## Data Content
- 459 samples from UK saltmarshes to represent diverse habitats and enable cross-site comparisons.
- Grain size distributions covering 0.02244–2000 µm.
- Primary variables: Grain_size_1 through Grain_size_100 (granulometric classes) and core metadata (Core_ID, Location, Core_depth_cm, Core_mid-depth_cm).
- Location details: sites described as saltmarsh names with coordinates in decimal degrees (WGS84).

## Methods and Quality Assurance
- Laboratory method: Malvern Laser Granulometer for grain-size analysis.
- Sample preparation: air-dry, break up with pestle and mortar, sieve through 0.5 mm, digest with 30% H2O2 (two additions), heat to ~50°C, then final analysis.
- Calibration: instrument calibrated using a standard of 0.152–0.422 mm sand.
- Quality control: all lab equipment calibrated according to University of York practices; data handling follows standardised procedures.
- File format: CSV; dataset named C_SIDE_saltmarsh_grain_size.csv.

## Spatial and Temporal Coverage
- Temporal: sampling conducted during 2018–2021.
- Spatial: United Kingdom; coordinates provided for each site, selected to reflect UK coastline diversity and enable comparable data across saltmarsh habitats.

## Data Structure and Access
- Core-level data: Core_ID, Location (saltmarsh name), Core_depth_cm, Core_mid-depth_cm.
- Grain-size data: Grain_size_1 to Grain_size_100, each representing a specific size class in micrometers.
- Data stewardship: description notes that data are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals for reuse and transparency.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring and Policy
- Supports standardized reporting of soil texture and grain-size distributions to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Enhances the value of the dataset by enabling integration with other environmental data sources and datasets beyond single-use analyses.
- Emphasizes data accessibility and provenance to allow other researchers and practitioners to access underlying data used to generate outputs.

## Challenges and Opportunities
- Challenge: increasing dataset value by combining grain-size data with complementary environmental datasets (e.g., carbon content, salinity, vegetation).
- Opportunity: improving access to underlying data to foster broader reuse and more robust environmental monitoring and decision-making.
