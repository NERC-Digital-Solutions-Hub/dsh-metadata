# Dataset Documentation

- This document documents the Countryside Survey dataset providing national estimates of landscape linear feature stock for 1990, calculated using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Estimates are presented as total lengths in thousands of kilometers ('000s km) for each linear feature type per Land Class, including lower and upper 95% confidence interval estimates.
- Key data fields include:
  - YEAR: Year of Survey
  - LAND_CLASS: ITE Land Class (description provided)
  - FEATURENO: Linear feature code
  - FEATURE: Linear feature description
  - LOWER_ESTIMATE, MEAN_ESTIMATE, UPPER_ESTIMATE: 95% CI bounds and mean length (in '000s km)
  - LAND_CLASS_AREA: Total area of the relevant Land Class (hundreds of hectares)
- Linear feature codes and descriptions:
  - _1: Hedge (managed hedgerows; may accompany other features)
  - _3: Wall (stone or manufactured block walls; may include fences/banks)
  - _4: Line of trees/shrubs/relict hedge/fence (natural-shaped line; may include banks/grass strips)
  - _5: Line of trees/shrubs/relict hedge (natural-shaped line; may include avenues)
  - _6: Bank/grass strip (earth/stone bank or grass strip)
  - _7: Fence (permanent post/rail/mesh; may be with grass strip, ditch, or stream)
  - TOTAL: Total length of linear features
- Reporting and data structure:
  - Information is recorded as codes during field surveys and reported via a hierarchical class system.
  - When reporting, there is no double counting of multi-element features; hedges have precedence in reporting when found with other features.
  - Hedge estimates are given precedence and walls/fences are not counted where a hedge is present.
- Data interpretation notes:
  - A hedge may be beside a wall or fence; however, hedge lengths are not included in wall or fence totals if associated with a hedge.
  - Negative values may appear in the MEAN_ESTIMATE due to the statistical model; these should be treated as zero.

- Practical notes for data leaders:
  - The dataset links national estimates to a standardized Land Classification, enabling cross-year and cross-feature comparisons.
  - The metadata and accompanying methodological references support data quality assessment, reproducibility, and discoverability within broader data ecosystems.
