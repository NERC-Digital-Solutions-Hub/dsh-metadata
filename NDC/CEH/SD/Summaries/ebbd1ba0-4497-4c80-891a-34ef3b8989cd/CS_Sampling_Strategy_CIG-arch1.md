# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey from 1978 through 2007, tying the current method to three decades of development in the ITE Land Classification.
- Emphasizes stratified, random sampling to achieve representative coverage of varied ecological land types and to enable robust national, regional, and country-specific estimates.
- Describes how the ITE Land Classification provides the framework for selecting sample squares and for scaling up field observations to national estimates.
- Highlights challenges and data-handling considerations, including modifying classifications for country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and adding upland modules for improved precision in unique areas.

## ITE Land Classification: Concept and Evolution
- Stratification is used to reduce bias and ensure representation across diverse land types; early stratification combined ecological variables (altitude, geology, climate) to define land classes.
- The ITE Land Classification originated in the 1970s from field-based vegetation work (e.g., Bunce and Shaw) and multi-variate classification (Indicator Species Analysis) to group land into 1 km square classes.
- For national surveys, a center square of a 15 x 15 km grid was classified, with surrounding squares also allocated to nearby classes to capture local variation; this formed the basis for sampling and national estimates.

## Key Milestones by Survey Year

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification (CS1978)
  - 32 Land Classes derived from environmental attributes.
  - Sampled 8 squares per class, total 256 squares.
  - Sampling framework: stratified, random selection from classified squares.
  - National estimates: calculated as the mean habitat area per square in each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that Land Class.

- 1984 – Second Field Survey (CS1984)
  - Sampling expanded to 12 km squares per Land Class, total 384 squares.
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - Demonstrated landscape changes and informed later refinements.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey (CS1990)
  - Moved to a Land Classification that incorporated data for every 1 km square in Great Britain; urban and sea corrections applied.
  - Surveyed 508 squares; repeated 1978 vegetation quadrats and expanded feature recording.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB derived from satellite imagery.
  - National estimates based on the 1990 Land Classification; results published in CS1990 main report.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification & Fourth Field Survey (CS1998/CS2000)
  - Updated classification to enable Scotland-specific reporting; number of Land Classes increased (to 40).
  - CS2000 expanded sampling to better represent country units (England with Wales and Scotland separately).
  - Adjustments included class subdivision and aggregation to ensure adequate representation across countries; Isle of Man sampling removed and replaced.
  - Additional squares implemented to improve representation of new classes; introduction of country-specific sampling rates and maps (England with Wales; Scotland).

- 2007 – Revised Land Classification & Fifth Field Survey (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further Wales-specific adjustments.
  - Welsh class subdivisions created 5 new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata expanded to 45.
  - Wales received additional samples (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class); some English classes retained smaller sample counts due to precision considerations.
  - England’s sample per some classes reduced to 4 squares in a few cases, with overall precision deemed acceptable per scoping studies.
  - Revised country maps and sampling framework implemented to support Wales-only reporting and maintain overall national estimates.

## Country-Specific Reporting and Upland Module
- Separate country estimates introduced to produce England with Wales and Scotland-focused results, reflecting devolved policy needs.
- Sampling framework subdivided Land Classes into country-specific versions; where needed, classes were aggregated within a country to maintain adequate sample sizes.
- Wales required greater representation due to reporting needs, prompting additional Welsh samples and sub-classing.
- Uplands and marginal uplands module added for CS2000/CS2007 to boost statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Data Handling, Estimates, and Comparability
- National estimates rely on linking land-class area with average habitat area per square; changes to classification affect cross-survey comparability.
- The document notes that using the latest Land Classification improves within-survey consistency, while cross-survey consistency may require careful alignment of classifications.
- The evolution from 32 to 40 to 45 Land Classes (and country-specific subdivisions) reflects a balance between regional detail, precision, and the need for country-level reporting.
- Tables and figures (referenced in the text) document the precise sample counts, area strata, and sampling rates by year and country, illustrating shifts in sampling density and class representation.

## Practical Implications for Analysts
- Data across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 reflect progressively more refined country-specific reporting and expanded class granularity, with upland modules enhancing precision in higher-altitude areas.
- When analyzing trend data, be mindful of classification changes (e.g., class splits/merges, country subdivisions) that can affect comparability; consult the latest Land Classification framework for harmonization.
- National habitat estimates are derived from class-level aggregates and the overall area represented by each class; changes in class definitions or sampling density will influence these estimates.
- For country-specific questions, use the country-unit classifications and the additional Wales upland and class subdivisions to ensure representative inference.

## Summary of Sample Scale and Coverage
- CS1978: 256 squares; 8 per class; 32 classes.
- CS1984: 384 squares; 12 per class; 32 classes.
- CS1990: 508 squares; nationwide classification updated to include all GB squares; satellite-based land cover mapping introduced.
- CS2000: about 569 GB squares; 40 Land Classes; England & Wales and Scotland reporting framework established; upland module added.
- CS2007: about 591 GB squares; 45 Land Classes; Wales-specific subdivisions implemented; Wales provided enhanced sampling to support Wales-only reporting; English classes adjusted accordingly.
