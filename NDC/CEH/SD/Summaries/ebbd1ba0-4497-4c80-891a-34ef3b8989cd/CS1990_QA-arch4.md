# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview
- A comprehensive quality assurance (QA) exercise for the 1990 Countryside Survey, assessing the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of field data collected across multiple surveyors, plots, and land classes.
- Aimed to quantify observer error, seasonality effects, plot relocation accuracy, and data quality to propose methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Aims and scope
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording and its impact on change statistics.
- Explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- Compare QA results with earlier ITE survey work.
- Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence in statistics for future surveys.

## Methods and QA design
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares assessed using original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Expanded QA with photographs of individual plots and a self-assessment component; included a 1 km square from each of the 32 terrain classes; focus on the effectiveness of photographs to re-locate plots.
- Plot types and sampling:
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X plots) and 4 m2 (Y plots).
  - Linear plots and features: road verges, hedges (perpendicular to water courses where applicable), streamsides, boundaries.
  - Within each selected quarter: nine predetermined points for land-cover and boundary features.
  - Use of buried metal plates to mark quadrats; photographs and sketch maps to assist relocation.
- Data types:
  - Vegetation cover estimates, species lists, and land-use/boundary codes.
  - Mapping of land-use primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover data.
- Annexes and analysis:
  - Tables and figures summarize species concordance, coverage differences, and sources of variation.
  - DECORANA (ordination) analyses used to interpret ecological gradient shifts between surveys.

## Key findings: accuracy, errors, and drivers
- Overall accuracy and agreement:
  - Autumn 1990: overall species agreement around 60% (percentage concordance ~60.9%); initial accuracy around 58–74% depending on metric and data subset.
  - 1991 QA (expanded): mean number of species per plot increased from 20.7 to 23.4; indicates a real ecological difference plus improved recording efficiency; statistical tests show significant differences in some plots; overall, 1991 results suggest both improved recording and ecological changes between years.
- Sources of variation (major error categories):
  - A) Mis-identification of species.
  - B) Species overlooked in the original survey (seasonal/management changes contribute).
  - C) Over-zealous or mis-recorded data.
  - D) Allocation and positional mismatches (mis-location, mis-orientation, or plot misalignment).
  - E-F) Seasonal and management-related changes (e.g., crop changes, herbicide use).
  - G-H) Plot mis-location/orientation at T2.
  - I-J) Other discrepancies and “mysteries.”
- Plot relocation and plate findings:
  - Plate relocation success (Autumn 1990): 71% recovery within a 5-minute search.
  - 1991 QA with photographs: higher relocation rates for larger features; X plots generally easier to relocate than Y plots; Y plots (small quadrats) most challenging.
  - Recommendations emphasize using photographs and ground features to improve relocation efficiency; metal plates useful but time-consuming in unenclosed uplands.
- Plot-type and land-class effects:
  - No significant differences in overall % accuracy across plot types; however, land-class aggregates show significant differences, with lowland arable and marginal lands typically more challenging to record accurately.
  - Uppland (UP) plots exhibit distinct vegetation communities, influencing axis scores and observed changes.
- Cover estimates and bryophyte considerations:
  - Comparisons of cover for select species show few significant differences between 1990 and 1991, though some species (notably grasses) show differential recording.
  - Bryophyte recording identified as an area needing improved training and inclusion in QA, especially for certain habitats.
- Mapping and codes:
  - Primary land-use codes show high concordance (roughly 88–95% depending on comparison), indicating robust core classifications.
  - Boundary codes show slightly lower concordance (around 80–83%), with higher agreement when same assessors revisited the same squares.
  - Use of numerous qualifiers and descriptive codes creates opportunities for misinterpretation; recommendations call for simplifying and clarifying mapping schemes.
- Species group trends:
  - Although some individual species show frequency changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana communis), no species-group level difference was statistically significant between 1990 and 1991 across all plot types.
- Ecological gradient and axis shifts:
  - DECORANA analysis indicates shifts along an ecological gradient between years, with upland aggregates showing a distinctive pattern; comparisons with long-term trends (e.g., 1978–1988) suggest year-to-year variation but overall direction aligns with broader land-use changes.

## Recommendations (highlights)
- QA and data collection practices:
  - QA should be conducted as close as practical to the initial survey to minimize seasonal and year-to-year variation.
  - Use photographs to re-establish plot positions; annotate photos with contextual details.
  - Annotate and relate photographs to plots; ensure distance to features is recorded; include compass bearings where possible.
  - Metal marker plates are effective for locating plots, but relocation in unenclosed uplands is time-consuming; allocate additional manpower for such areas.
  - For Y plots (4 m2), define plots with a survey tape, orient with a defined side (N-S) and place at SE corner.
- Plot relocation and data capture:
  - Photographs should clearly depict plot surroundings; include nearby distinguishing features for easy re-location.
  - Improve techniques for quadrat positioning and ensure consistent protocol adherence.
- Species recording and training:
  - Strengthen training on distinguishing grasses and vegetative forms; increase attention to bryophytes and less-dominant species.
  - Focus on seasonal effects and their impact on species presence and coverage, and align QA timing with survey timing.
- Land-use and mapping standards:
  - Refine land-use primary codes, subdivide key upland/lowland categories (e.g., upland grassland, upland improved pasture, rush-pasture, wet heath).
  - Introduce clearer defaults for boundary coding (hedges vs. hedges of different dominance) and restrict the use of ambiguous boundary codes.
  - Emphasize recording only the dominant or most informative species for mapping to improve reproducibility.
  - Limit the number of descriptive codes used in mapping to reduce interpretive variation.
- Data quality and governance:
  - Ensure data lineage and provenance are well-documented to support reproducibility and auditability.
  - Align QA exercises with the same-year data collection to minimize climate- or management-driven changes in species.
  - Use the QA findings to inform training curricula, survey manuals, and standardized field protocols.

## Practical implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates the critical importance of QA in large-scale, multi-operator data collection programs to ensure data quality and trust in derived statistics.
- Highlights the need for clear, low-ambiguity coding schemes and robust metadata to support data governance and interoperability.
- Emphasizes balancing data richness (e.g., detailed species lists) with reproducibility (favoring dominant species for mapping; reducing over-interpretation of qualifiers).
- Underlines the value of photographic and plate-based relocation as part of a modern data pipeline for reproducible field data capture.
- Shows how ecological data quality can be compromised by seasonal/annual variation and how aligning sampling time points improves comparability.
