COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Overview
- Large-scale, long-term data collection to monitor land use, land cover, vegetation, and landscape features across Great Britain.
- Builds datasets for scientific evaluation of ecological systems and to identify trends and processes in the countryside.
- Combines field surveys with remote sensing connections (satellite imagery) and up-to-date mapping.

## Survey Design and Planning
- 512 square sample sites nationwide, grouped into six teams; each team covers ~85 squares.
- Each square allocated about three survey days; flexible scheduling, with travel time prioritised and no overtime pay (time off in lieu may be offered for large overtime).
- Sampling strategy includes both ground-truth field data and planned integration with top-down remote sensing to produce a land cover map.
- Emphasis on standardised recording to enable comparability across observers and years; quality control is a core objective for 1990 resurvey.

## Equipment and Documentation
- Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, OS maps, and laminated project materials supplied by Merlewood.
- Local ITE stations provide additional equipment (maps, pencils, cameras, field references, first aid kits, etc.).
- Permanent markers (metal plates) or field-boundary markers used to relocate plots in future surveys.
- Data and samples transported to ITE stations (Merlewood) for processing and storage.

## Data Recording and Coding (FAB and Codes)
- Three main data elements per square: mapping, quadrat recording, and sampling (plus planned sampling of freshwater biota).
- Coding system uses primary and secondary codes to annotate features on 1:10,000 maps; a compact alpha-numeric coding scheme reduces map clutter but preserves detail.
- Boundaries, land use, and vegetation types are recorded with standardized codes; where multiple codes apply, dominant or most representative codes are prioritized.
- FABs must be completed neatly; each page includes square number, ownership, and detailed notes. If a boundary or feature no longer exists, special codes (e.g., 999) or notes are used.
- Vegetation recording relies on a defined list of 200 common species (plus unlisted species as needed) with cover estimates in 5% increments; bryophytes and lichens are recorded with a restricted list.
- For woodland and trees, use woodland codes with at least one primary code; scale and age classes are captured; double-use land is recorded to show multiple functions (e.g., trees in pasture).
- 1) Minimum mappable unit and 2) maximum permitted plot sizes are defined to ensure consistency.
- Special attention to API (Aerial Photo Interpretation) conventions for boundary indication, isolated features, and “no longer present” boundaries.

## Field Procedures and Permissions
- On arrival, surveyors make a quick site assessment, seek permission for access, and select a route enabling full square coverage.
- Permissions are crucial; if access is denied for parts of a square, predefined procedures determine how to proceed or whether to abandon the square and replace it.
- Ownership data collection includes identifying owners/tenants, contact details, and an ownership cooperation rating to gauge future survey viability.
- There are procedures to follow when land access is refused or limited, and guidelines to minimize disruption to landowners and neighbours.

## Vegetation Sampling and Plot Layout (6.2)
- Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots per square, intended to cover major habitats; arranged to represent habitat diversity.
- Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots placed in natural or semi-natural land cover types to capture finer-scale variation.
- Linear plots: up to five plots for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides, with precise placement rules to avoid overlap and ensure reproducibility.
- Placement strategies consider field boundaries, dominant vertical features, and the need to avoid bias in habitat representation.
- Permanent markers accompany plots to enable precise relocation in future surveys; maps and sketches accompany FAB entries.

## Vegetation Recording Methods (6.2.2–6.2.5)
- A standardised data sheet (plot form) records habitat attributes, species presence, and cover estimates; nested quadrats within large plots are sampled sequentially to build an overall community composition.
- 200 common species list (plus unlisted species) is used; cover is estimated in 5% bands; absolute accuracy is balanced against field practicality.
- Species identifications may involve combination codes where exact ID is difficult; bryophytes and lichens have restricted lists for consistency.
- Plot types include large 200 m2 quadrats, smaller 2 m x 2 m quadrats, boundary plots, hedgerow plots, streamsides, and roadside plots; relocation and re-plotting rules from earlier surveys (1977/78, 1988) are incorporated.

## Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API)
- API is used to identify features not present on OS maps (e.g., isolated trees, boundaries between semi-natural vegetation types).
- API guidance is conservative: use dashed lines for boundaries, crosses for isolated features, diamonds for boundaries no longer present; in-ground evidence supersedes API when conflicts occur.

## Freshwater and Sampling (Section 7)
- Freshwater biota sampling is conducted in two ways:
  - Flowing waters (IFE): detailed freshwater biota sampling following a separate handbook.
  - Standing waters (NELUP): focus on water beetles; two samples per square from vegetated standing waters when possible.
- Sampling site selection aims to reflect the two characteristic water habitats within each square (e.g., lakes/lochs, ponds, ditches, calcareous/acidy flushes, sphagnum pools, etc.).
- Samples are preserved in formalin and transported back to Merlewood.

## Photography (Section 8)
- Print photographs are taken of every vegetation plot to document appearance and reference landmarks; plot numbers are displayed on a board at the plot edge.

## Procedures Subsequents (Section 9)
- End-of-day data reconciliation: ensure no omissions; avoid post-hoc transposition unless maps or forms are damaged.
- FABs and samples are transported back to ITE stations as soon as possible.

## Data Leaders’ Takeaways
- The Countryside Survey 1990 represents a tightly codified, scalable data collection framework designed for long-term ecological trend analysis, with explicit emphasis on data standardisation, documentation, and reproducibility.
- Key data assets include: FABs (structured with primary/secondary codes), 1:10,000 mapped data, nested quadrats and linear plots, photographic records, and freshwater biota samples.
- Data governance considerations:
  - Ensure consistent field recording across observers through a Field Handbook and predefined coding schemes.
  - Maintain provenance via permanent markers and relocation records to support multi-year analyses.
  - Capture metadata about land ownership and permissions to model access risk and bias.
  - Integrate field data with remote sensing (satellite imagery) for robust land-cover mapping.
- Challenges to anticipate and address:
  - Understanding diverse user needs and ensuring data products are co-owned with stakeholders.
  - Gaps in data availability, access barriers (permissions, paywalls), and variable data quality/metadata.
  - Coordination within the sector to avoid duplicated efforts and build stronger communities of practice.
- For data leaders, the document demonstrates a blueprint for scalable, quality-controlled environmental data programs that balance field practicality with rigorous, standards-based data management and long-term reuse.
