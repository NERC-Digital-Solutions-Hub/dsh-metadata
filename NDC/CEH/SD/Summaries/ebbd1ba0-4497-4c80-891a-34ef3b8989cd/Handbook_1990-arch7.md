# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Large-scale field survey to monitor land use, land cover, and landscape features for updating databases and informing ecological and planning analyses.
  - Two-tier approach linking bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing to create current Britain-wide land cover maps.
  - Re-survey planned for 1990 to capture changes since 1977/78 and 1984, with extended data capture and collaboration.

- Aims and audience focus for GIS context
  - Produce map-based data products that are easy to understand and explore for policy colleagues, clients, and the public.
  - Provide standardized, high-quality data suitable for integration into GIS, including changes over time.

- Sampling design and scope
  - 512 squares to be surveyed in 1990, grouped into six teams from six ITE Research Stations; 128 new squares and 128 previously unrecorded squares.
  - Each square expected to take ~3 survey days; flexible scheduling to minimize travel and maximize efficiency; no overtime unless compensated with time off in lieu.
  - Permissions for access are essential; procedures detailed for dealing with refusals and establishing ownership/tenure.

- Equipment and data infrastructure
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, weatherproof clipboards, colored pens, survey poles, and other field gear.
  - Local station support with maps, reference books, cameras, field markers; surveyors also bring personal gear.
  - Permanent markers (metal plates) used to relocate plots; documentation and sketches accompany every FAB entry.

- Data recording and coding (FAB system)
  - Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (with vegetation sampling covered in detail in Section 7).
  - Data annotation on 1:10,000 maps using primary and secondary codes; alpha codes (A, B, etc.) compress multiple numeric codes into a single symbol.
  - Codes are organized to reflect logical sequences (e.g., a boundary code followed by a habitat code); “X” marks indicate point information (e.g., isolated trees).
  - Minimum mappable units: 1/25 hectare for vegetated areas; minimum mapped length 20 m; non-vegetation mapped with care; long-standing boundaries updated (code 999 when no longer present).
  - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) used to aid boundary delineation and feature identification, with field- grounded validation.

- Mapping and API (6.1)
  - Enriched mapping exercise; field teams annotate 6" maps (1:10,000) with a range of data categories; combinations of data codes used to describe land cover features.
  - API conventions: contours, place names removed on working copies; dashed lines mark API-identified boundaries; isolated features marked with crosses; “no longer present” boundaries marked with diamonds.
  - FABs and maps are compiled into a Field Assessment Booklet for each square, guiding consistent field recording.

- Field procedures and surveying workflow
  - On-site assessment for access, problem areas, and route planning to ensure full square coverage.
  - Systematic data checks on completion; post-survey data transfer to ITE stations with samples shipped promptly.
  - Field decisions are made in the field rather than in post-processing to ensure accurate coding (including boundary decisions and feature classifications).

- Plot types and layout (6.2)
  - Large quadrats (200 m2) and nested quadrats (4 m2) for vegetation mapping; five large quadrats per square, plus five 4 m2 quadrats, plus five 2 m2 quadrats where applicable.
  - Small quadrats to sample natural/semi-natural habitats across land cover types; five small quadrats per square placed in diverse habitats.
  - Linear plots: hedgerows (H), streamsides (S, V), and roadsides (R, V) plots, up to five per square, laid out relative to dominant linear features and field boundaries.
  - Boundary rules: place at boundary markers; if boundaries change, relocate using documented methods; markers and sketches accompany each plot.
  - 1978 Rules (6.2.4) govern locating linear plots when squares were recorded earlier; adjustments described for relocation, overlap, and boundary interactions.

- Vegetation sampling protocol (6.2.2, 6.2.3)
  - Standardized vegetation plots with a fixed protocol across all plot types; standard recording sheets list up to ~200 common species with flexibility for unlisted species.
  - Relative cover estimated in 5% increments; species identification guided by a core list and acceptable combinations when precise ID isn’t possible.
  - Special attention to complex mosaics, multi-layer canopies, and boundary line vegetation; use dominant primary codes to describe mosaic ground cover.
  - Permanent marking of plots and careful recording of location, orientation, and measurements; sketches and photographs accompany each plot.
  - Bryophytes and lichens recorded using a restricted list; separate mosses/lichens list provided for consistency.

- Data standards and GIS-ready outputs
  - Emphasis on standardized field protocols, consistent coding, and precise geolocation to support GIS integration and longitudinal comparison.
  - Use of universal and coded descriptors for boundaries, vegetation, land use, and man-made features to facilitate cross-square aggregation and time-series analyses.
  - Documentation of ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland water, coastal features, and forestry/woodland components to support multi-layer GIS datasets.

- Freshwater and sampling components (Section 7)
  - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE) and standing water (NELUP at Newcastle University) sampled per square.
  - Two standing-water samples per square reflecting typical water habitats (lakes/lochs, ponds, ditches, calcareous/acidi flushes, Sphagnum habitats, etc.).
  - Samples collected with sieve, preserved (formalin), labeled, and transported back to Merlewood for processing.

- Photography and post-survey procedures (Sections 8, 9)
  - Photography of vegetation plots to document appearance and context; plot number displayed on a plastic board for field reference.
  - Post-survey: confirm completeness of FABs, consider map re-transcription only if damage occurs, and arrange sample/data transport back to ITE stations promptly.

- Practicalities and governance for GIS specialists
  - Clear guidelines for permissions, ownership, and farmer engagement to ensure data quality and survey continuity.
  - Emphasis on field standardization to minimize observer variation and improve statistical reliability of change data.
  - The handbook provides exhaustive coding conventions, plot-locating logic, and data collection workflows designed to produce robust, GIS-friendly map data and change detection capabilities.
