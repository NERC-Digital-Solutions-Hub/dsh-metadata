# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Purpose: Assess and improve the reliability and consistency of field vegetation recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey, quantify observer and seasonal effects, and propose methodological refinements for future surveys.

## Overview of QA Approach

- Two-phase QA:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares assessed using original sketch maps for plot relocation; included two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Expanded QA using photographs of plots and an extended itinerary; tested improvements from photographs and self-assessment in additional squares.
- Plot types examined:
  - Quadrats: X plots (200 m2) and Y plots (4 m2) with relocation targets anchored to original corners/plates.
  - Linear plots: road verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries, and other linear features.
  - Sub-sampling: one quarter of each square resurveyed to include representative plot types; six plot types total.
- Relocation and verification:
  - Used sketch maps, photographs, and metal plates to relocate plots; assessed plate relocation success and overall plot relocation accuracy.
- Data elements:
  - Landcover and boundary features recorded at 9 predetermined points within each quarter.
  - Species lists and cover estimates recorded for each plot, with multiple concordance and accuracy indices developed to compare T1 (original survey) and T2 (QA/reassessment).

## Key Metrics and Findings

- Species concordance and accuracy (1990 QA):
  - Overall percentage agreement between T1 and T2: 60.9%.
  - Initial efficiency (accuracy) of recording: approximately 74%.
  - Major error sources identified:
    - Mis-identifications (A)
    - Species overlooked at T1 (B)
    - Mis-location / mis-orientation of plots (G/H, I)
    - Seasonal or annual changes (F)
    - Recording of cover values and nearby features (affecting interpretation)
- Change in species metrics (1990 vs. 1991 QA):
  - Mean number of species per plot increased from 20.7 (1990) to 23.4 (1991) across all plots; significant overall difference (p < 0.001).
  - By landclass and plot type, increases varied; upland plots showed distinctive patterns, and drought/seasonal effects contributed to observed changes.
  - Some observed changes (e.g., increases in certain common grasses and herbs) reflect genuine population shifts, while others reflect under-recording in 1990 or seasonal variation.
- Effect of year/season and drought:
  - Comparisons suggest drought in 1990 contributed to under-recording in some plots, while 1991 (a more typical growing season) yielded higher species counts.
  - Seasonal effects were particularly pronounced for resemble grasses and bryophytes, especially in moist upland habitats.
- Plot relocation and marker effectiveness:
  - Plate relocation yield varied by plot type and land class; overall plate-based relocation showed reasonable recovery but was more time-consuming in unenclosed uplands.
  - Photographs significantly improved relocation accuracy for some plot types; X plots benefited most from photographic re-establishment of exact positions.
- Mapping and landuse coding:
  - Primary landuse codes showed high concordance (approximately 88–95%), with boundary codes slightly lower (~80–83% in some comparisons due to re-surveying by same vs different assessors).
  - Qualifiers and level-of-detail codes exhibited interpretation differences across assessors, highlighting the need for clearer definitions and potential code simplification.
  - Point-by-point landcover and boundary mapping generally reliable in lowland areas; greater variability in upland/unenclosed areas due to location and feature identification challenges.
- Cover estimates:
  - Comparison of cover for principal species showed significant differences for some species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Urtica dioica) between 1990 and 1991, driven by seasonal and habitat-specific factors.
  - Co-dominant species mappings were less reproducible; single-dominant species had higher repeatability.
- DECORANA analysis and ecological gradients:
  - Axis 1 shifts indicated an overall gradient consistent with changes in land management, crop type, and nutrient status, with upland vs lowland differences.
  - Across plot types, axis shift direction generally aligned with expected ecological trends; some variation suggested year-to-year perturbations in response to landuse changes and climatic conditions.
- Mapping of vegetation and boundaries:
  - Mapping codes for landuse and vegetation generally reliable; minor categories were more variable due to limited frequency and interpretive differences.
  - Recommendation to simplify mapping codes and emphasize recording the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit to improve reproducibility.
- Overall interpretation for environmental monitoring:
  - The QA demonstrates that data collected in large-field surveys are subject to observer, seasonal, and relocation-related variation.
  - Photographic aids, standardized marker systems, and clearer coding conventions substantially improve data reliability and comparability over time.

## Principal Challenges and Sources of Variation

- A: Mis-identifications and mis-codings in original recordings.
- B: Species overlooked during the initial survey.
- C: Over-zealous or inconsistent recording within plot boundaries.
- D–J: Various combinations of crop change, seasonal shifts, plot mis-location, mis-orientation, and missed recordings at time 2.
- I2 variations: Changes due to seasonality and management changes between surveys.
- Spatial relocation difficulties, particularly for small Y plots and unenclosed upland plots.

## Recommendations for Future Surveys

- Recommendation 1: Retain lichen recording with training materials and habitat context to improve recognition.
- Recommendation 2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey date (seasonally aligned).
- Recommendation 3: Surveyors should annotate photographs and relate them to the plot, including distances to nearby features; enhance photo-documentation to ease relocation.
- Recommendation 4: Use metal marker plates to mark X plots wherever possible to aid relocation (with more manpower in unenclosed upland areas).
- Recommendation 5: Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with a survey tape, orient so the side, not the diagonal, is aligned N-S, and place the plot at the SE corner; plate usage recommended.
- Recommendation 6–7: (Implied consistency and training emphasis)
  - Emphasize accurate location and orientation in QA exercises.
- Recommendation 8–12 (mapping and coding refinements):
  - Refine upland landclass codes (e.g., subdivide upland grassland and upland improved meadow/pasture).
  - Introduce a distinct lowland rush pasture code.
  - Recognize wet heath as a primary vegetation type.
  - Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge and document species composition with qualifying codes.
  - Increase the number of primary landuse codes and adopt simpler, more dichotomous coding to reduce ambiguity.
  - Map only the two most prevalent species at a given point to improve reproducibility.
- Additional methodological implications:
  - Map quality should be assessed by primary code frequencies and point-by-point location accuracy.
  - Focus training on distinguishing similar taxa, particularly grasses and bryophytes, and expanding bryophyte coverage where relevant.
  - Align QA with a single season/year for each plot type to minimize climatic-driven discrepancies.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring and Data Management

- Consistency and comparability: Standardized methods, improved relocation markers, and clearer coding schemas enhance long-term data comparability for environmental health and policy performance analysis.
- Data sharing and transparency: Documented QA findings and explicit recommendations support better data governance, versioning, and reuse of monitoring datasets across agencies.
- Continuous improvement: The Countryside Survey QA demonstrates a viable path for iterative data quality improvement through phased testing, photographic documentation, and targeted training.

## Conclusion

- The 1990 QA demonstrated meaningful initial data reliability challenges but showed substantial improvements in 1991 with the use of photographs and refined processes.
- Key gains came from better plot relocation, clearer coding, and enhanced training on species identification and habitat recording.
- For ongoing environmental monitoring, adopting the QA-driven recommendations would enhance data quality, enable more reliable trend analysis, and support informed policy evaluation.
