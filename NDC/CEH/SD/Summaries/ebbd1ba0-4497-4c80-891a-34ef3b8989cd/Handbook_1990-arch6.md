# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Long-term rural environment monitoring using the ITE Land Classification System.
  - Builds on past surveys (1977/78, 1984, 1988) to update land-use and vegetation data and to model landscape change.
  - Aims to provide current, ground-truth data and to link top-down remote sensing with bottom-up field surveys; includes construction of a Britain land cover map and enhanced data capture for pattern detection.
  - Survey designed for resurvey in 1990 with expanded sample size (512 sites total; 128 new), enhanced data capture, and increased collaboration.

- Sampling and planning
  - Sample squares split into six groups, surveyed by teams from six ITE Research Stations (about 85 squares per group).
  - Each square planned for roughly three survey days; flexible scheduling to minimize repeated visits and travel time; no overtime unless via time off in lieu.
  - Travel-based cost efficiency and planning options (local daily travel; several weeks away with weekends; occasional one-week blocks).

- Equipment and data products
  - Equipment provided: Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), enlarged maps, aerial photographs, weatherproof clipboards, markers, survey poles, measuring tapes, etc.
  - Additional support from local ITE stations; surveyors may bring personal gear.

- General field procedure
  - On arrival: assess area, anticipate problems, seek permissions for access, plan a route allowing complete square coverage.
  - After recording: review notes for omissions and ensure clear presentation.

- Permissions and landowner engagement
  - Permissions required to access all parts of a square; letters to landowners ahead of visits; contact on-site to confirm arrangements.
  - If permission is denied, follow procedures to abandon the square or pivot to an alternative area; maintain ownership and contact records.
  - Two farmer categories: previously visited and new to the 1990 sample; coordinate with Station Coordinators for access issues.

- Data recording framework (FAB)
  - The Countryside Survey 1990 comprises three core elements: mapping, recording of quadrats, and sampling (the latter covered in Section 7).
  - Use of a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) to combine square data with 6" maps; emphasis on neat, legible entries to facilitate later analysis.
  - Data encoding relies on a hierarchical system of primary and secondary codes, with alpha codes used to compress multiple numeric codes.
  - Boundary and ownership information are recorded; if boundaries no longer exist, codes reflect current ground truth (e.g., code 999 for no longer present).

- Mapping and aerial photograph interpretation (API)
  - Mapping annotations use standardized data codes; API provides guidance on identifying features not on OS maps (isolated trees, boundaries between vegetation types, new buildings, roads).
  - API boundaries are advisory; field verification remains essential.

- Data entry and coding conventions
  - Clear rules for order of codes, dominance of primary codes, and handling mosaics (dominant cover code first; multiple primary codes avoided).
  - Distinct procedures for marking boundaries, field decisions, and use of cross marks for point information.
  - All square series numbers documented on every FAB page; pencil preferred for erasability; color conventions for complex features.

- Vegetation monitoring and plot design (6.2.2–6.2.3)
  - Large vegetation plots: five 200 m2 quadrats plus nested 4 m2 quadrats to capture fine-scale variation; additional five small 2 m x 2 m quadrats placed in different land-cover types per square.
  - Plots are positioned to minimize bias and reflect habitat types; relocation rules apply if habitats change (e.g., development or land-use change).
  - Permanent marking: metal plates or fixed markers placed near plot corners for reliable relocation; documentation of plot location on sketch maps and accompanying photographs.

- Plot types and relocation rules
  - Large quadrats (200 m2): centered on habitat, with relocation procedures if land-use changes; extension may be used in linear features to preserve sample area.
  - Small quadrats (2 m x 2 m): placed in diverse semi-natural habitats after land-cover mapping; randomization used when habitat types exceed five categories; frequency and recording of plot identifications on a single list.

- Linear plots (6.2.3)
  - Five 10 m x 1 m plots for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides; rules prevent overlap and ensure plots are not placed within 10 m of each other on the same feature.
  - Location decisions based on dominant vertical feature (hedge, wall, ditch, bank, etc.); permanent markers placed at plot ends; similar relocation rules as for quadrats.

- 1978 rules for locating linear plots (6.2.4)
  - Specific placement guidelines relative to boundaries and boundary types to ensure comparability with earlier surveys; includes hedgerows, streams, rivers, and ditches.
  - If a feature is ineligible (too narrow or confused by other plots), relocate to nearest permissible position and document changes.

- Species identification and data integrity (6.2.5)
  - Aim to identify to species level; allowances for difficult taxa with predefined species-combination codes to maintain consistency (e.g., certain Cardamine, Epilobium, Juncus, etc.).
  - Restricted lists for bryophytes and lichens; the 200 most frequent species from prior surveys are provided as reference; unlisted species documented separately.
  - Field guidance includes a standard procedure for specimen collection, diagrams, and 5% cover category estimates; mosaic and layered vegetation reflected through multiple codes.

- Sampling of freshwater biota (Section 7)
  - Two freshwater biota samples per square: flowing waters (IFE) and standing waters (NELUP); flowing-water sampling protocol described in a separate handbook.
  - Standing-water samples prioritized in vegetated habitats; labels include square number, date, and surveyor.
  - Bottles preserved with formalin for transport to Merlewood; time-limited searching to minimize disturbance.

- Photography (Section 8)
  - Print photographs taken for every vegetation plot to capture general appearance and geographic context; plot number displayed on a board at the plot edge.

- Procedures after survey (Section 9)
  - End-of-day data checks to prevent omissions; avoid unnecessary re-transcription unless data loss requires it.
  - FABs and samples shipped back to ITE stations promptly; minimize delays to ensure data integrity.

- Data quality, governance, and delivery
  - Emphasis on standardization across observers, consistency of data capture, and robust field-to-database workflow.
  - Full documentation of plot locations, ownership, permissions, and changes over time to support longitudinal analyses.
  - Well-defined coding schemes (primary/secondary codes), boundary definitions, and a comprehensive catalog of plant species (including common grasses, forbs, bryophytes, and lichens) to enable reproducible data products.

- Output and applicability for data support
  - Structured field data (FAB), large and small quadrats, linear plots, API data, ownership information, and biota samples contribute to self-serve data products, trend analyses, and landscape modelling.
  - The dataset supports linking ground-based surveys with satellite-derived land cover maps and landscape-change assessments, enabling informed decision-making for rural land management and policy.
