# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Aim and scope
- Update land-use databases, monitor changes, and support practical decisions through data analysis.
- Combine field survey data with satellite remote sensing, using a two-tier approach to connect bottom-up measurements with top-down imagery.
- Resurvey planned for 1990 to extend land-cover, landscape, and vegetation data and to construct a Britain land-cover map.
- Emphasis on standardised field recording and quality control to enable robust ecological change analysis and modelling.

## Design and sampling
- 512 sample squares distributed across six ITE Research Stations, grouped into six areas.
- Each square allocated to a team; about 85 squares per team.
- Surveying assumed to take ~3 days per square; flexible working arrangements; travel-based logistics to minimize overnight stays.
- Previous surveys (1977/78, 1984, 1988) underpin design; 128 new sites added to bring total to 512.
- Data aims include land-cover mapping, landscape features, and ground-truth data to link top-down remote sensing with field observations.

## Equipment and data collection environment
- Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, and site handouts provided.
- Weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, marker plates, sampling gear, measuring tapes, navigation tools, and identification resources.
- Local ITE stations provide location maps, basic tools, and personal equipment; Merlewood provides FABs, site images, and other essentials.
- Permanent markers and robust data-management practices to ensure repeatability and future plot relocation.

## Permissions and field access
- Permissions sought to ensure legal access to all square parts and to maintain good relations with landowners/farmers.
- Prior contact beneficial but may cause delays; if permission is refused for parts of a square, field recording may be abandoned or partially adjusted per guidelines.
- Coordinators keep ownership information and special access requirements; contact farmers directly when possible and document difficulties.

## Data recording and coding system (FAB)
- Mapping and recording drive the data capture: annotation of 1:10,000 maps with a structured code system.
- Primary and secondary codes are used to describe land-cover types, boundaries, features, and other attributes; codes are combined to convey multiple characteristics in a compact form.
- Boundaries are mapped clearly (actual vs interpreted) and coded; if a boundary no longer exists, code 999 is used.
- Minimum mapping units and lengths: 1/25 hectare minimum, 20 m minimum boundary length.
- Non-vegetative features may be recorded with a cross (X); care to maintain legibility and field-processor integration.
- “X” universal codes and various colour conventions exist for built environments if color-coding is used.
- FAB pages include sections for ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland/coastal features, agriculture/vegetation, forestry/woodland, boundaries, buildings/structures/communications, and universal codes.

## Aerial photograph interpretation (API)
- API helps identify features not on OS maps (e.g., isolated trees) and assist with boundary delineation between semi-natural vegetation types.
- Dashed lines indicate API-identified boundaries; isolated features marked with crosses; “no longer present” boundaries marked with diamonds.
- API guidance is supplementary; ground truthing remains the primary source of evidence.

## Vegetation sampling methodology (6.2.2)
- Standardised vegetation recording using plots of different sizes, all described by a unified recording form.
- Large quadrats: five 200 m2 quadrats per square; nested 4 m2 quadrats within to capture fine-scale variation.
- Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots placed in natural or semi-natural land cover types in each square.
- Nested plotting allows assessment of species presence and cover in progressively smaller areas; all species recorded with presence/absence and 5% cover estimates.
- A master species list (common 200 species) informs the core dataset; unlisted species can be added with a note.
- Permanent markers mark quadrat positions to facilitate future relocation; field sketches and photographs accompany data sheets.
- If vegetation types shift due to land-use changes, plots may be relocated or replanned with detailed documentation.

## Plot types and layout (6.2.3)
- Quadrats (large): five 200 m2 plots per square; five nested sub-quadrats within each for detailed vegetation description.
- Small plots: five 2 m x 2 m plots placed in five distinct land-cover types beyond those represented by large quadrats.
- Linear plots (up to 5 per type per square; enclosures only): hedgerow (B), streamside (S), roadsides (R).
- Boundary, hedge, stream, road plots have precise 1 m widths or 1 m offsets from features; exact positions are recorded on maps and FABs.
- 1978 rules for locating linear plots provide baseline methods; 1990 rules refine relocation and placement when features shift or are absent.

## Species identification guidelines (6.2.5)
- Field identification targets species to the species level; where difficult, predefined acceptable species combinations are recorded to maintain consistency with prior surveys.
- Bryophytes and lichens are recorded with specified limited lists; some general groups may be recorded as combinations when precise IDs are uncertain.
- The list of frequent crops, grasses, forbs, and woody species (including representative codes) is supplied to standardise recording.

## Ownership, farmer information, and boundaries (FAB sections)
- Ownership data recorded for land units within each square; owner/tenant contacts and cooperation levels are noted.
- Farmer/Landowner information collected as background context; observations stored as conversation notes.
- Boundaries and structures are systematically coded (e.g., walls, fences, hedges, gates) with guidance on when to classify structures as curtilage or landscape features.

## Freshwater and biota sampling (Section 7)
- Freshwater biota sampling conducted in two streams per square: IFE (Institute of Freshwater Ecology) sampling for flowing waters and NELUP sampling for standing waters (water beetles focus).
- Five additional (extra) aquatic plots may be included to represent river/ditch/stream diversity; specific layout depends on waterway types present.
- Detailed procedures for labeling, sample collection, preservation, and transport to Merlewood are provided.

## Photography (Section 8)
- Print photography captures vegetation plots to document general appearance and landmark context.
- Plot numbers displayed on a board at the plot edge; photos linked to FABs for later interpretation.

## Procedures subsequent to survey (Section 9)
- Daily review of data sheets to prevent omissions; minimize post-hoc transcription unless necessary due to damage or loss of original maps.
- FABs and samples are to be returned to ITE stations promptly; documentation and sample handling follow established protocols.

## Data handling, quality control, and dissemination
- Standardisation across observers is emphasised to minimise recording variation and improve statistical accuracy.
- Quality control measures implemented during the 1990 survey to improve consistency across observers and sites.
- Datasets and metadata are intended to be discoverable and usable by uploading to portals with robust metadata.
- Information on how to access background references and project contacts (ITE Merlewood) is provided.
