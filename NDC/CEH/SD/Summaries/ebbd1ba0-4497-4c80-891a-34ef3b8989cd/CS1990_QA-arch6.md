# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Aims: quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey; explain differences in recording due to observer error, season, plot location, and information type; relate to prior ITE surveys; recommend methodological modifications for more accurate future surveys.
- Context: field work involved many recorders with training and supervision; QA seeks to measure consistency and reliability across major field components and data types (vegetation, landuse, boundaries, etc.).

## Scope and Aims (highlights)
- Assess accuracy of field recording and change statistics.
- Explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- Compare conclusions with previous comparative work (ITE surveys).
- Recommend methodological changes to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics.

## Methods and Data Collection

- QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares reassessed using sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: added photographs of individual plots and self-assessment in some squares; each 1km square visited within 14 days of original date for the majority of cases.
- Plot types (six types total):
  - X plots: 200 m2 quadrats (and variations); Y plots: 4 m2 quadrats.
  - Linear plots (1O m): roadverges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries (and related features in enclosed land).
- Relocation and data capture:
  - Re-located buried metal plates marking quadrat corners, using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors.
  - Nine predetermined points per quarter square for landcover and boundary features.
  - Plate relocation outcomes categorized as: plate and plot relocated; plate found but plot matched; plate not found (insufficient information).
- Data quality measures:
  - Species concordance: multiple indices to compare species lists between T1 (original survey) and T2 (QA).
  - Cover estimates: visual estimates for species >5% cover; Wilcoxon tests used for comparison.
  - Landuse and boundary mapping: primary codes, qualifiers, and level codes; cross-comparisons across time and assessors.
- Additional QA elements:
  - Annexes describing QA itinerary, distance/position of boundaries, and self-assessment squares to gauge assessor consistency.

## Key Metrics and Results

- Plate/plot relocation performance:
  - Autumn 1990: about 71% recovery rate for plates; 87% recovery for plots (guide times ~5 minutes).
  - 1991 QA: combined plate and plot relocation showed substantial improvements when photographs were used, with better relocation for X plots; Y plots remained challenging.
- Species concordance and change:
  - Overall initial species agreement (across all plots) around 45–47% in early QA analysis; full QA across 21 squares yielded 60.9% overall agreement between T1 and T2.
  - 1991 QA showed a notable increase in mean species per plot (1990: 20.7–22.7; 1991: about 23.4 for all plots), with significant differences in upland vs lowland classes and plot types.
  - Seasonal/annual effects: substantial portion of the observed species changes attributed to real ecological differences (e.g., drought year 1990 vs more typical 1991) rather than mere recording error; some increases also reflect improved recording efficiency by assessors.
- Plot-type and landclass effects:
  - X plots (and roadverge) generally easier to relocate than Y plots; upland plots less seasonal variation than lowland plots.
  - Lower accuracy in lowland arable (LC) squares; upland plots and other landclass aggregates (LG, MA, UP) showed higher consistency.
- Cover estimates:
  - Differences in cover for some common species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Urtica dioica, Dactylis glomerata) between 1990 and 1991 were statistically notable; most differences attributed to seasonal/management changes or recording biases.
  - Bryophytes and some grasses identified as bigger sources of error; recommendations emphasize targeted training on grasses and bryophytes.
- Landuse and boundary mapping accuracy:
  - Primary landuse codes showed high concordance (around 88%), boundaries slightly lower (around 80–82%), and coding levels (Level vs Level 2) showed substantial agreement but with interpretive variation.
  - Problems noted in complex boundary coding (e.g., hawthorn-rich hedges, stockproof vs non-stockproof, hedges with varying height/management) and in the application of certain qualitative boundary codes.
- Mapping of vegetation and species cover:
  - Point-by-point concordance for most prevalent species around 81% for the first species at a point, decreasing for co-dominants (about 34%), and very low for three co-dominants (~5%).
  - Recommendation: focus on the two most prevalent species for landuse parcels to improve reproducibility; reduce emphasis on detailed species cover coding to enhance consistency.

## Major Findings by Theme

- Accuracy and change statistics:
  - A substantial portion of apparent change between 1990 and 1991 was real ecological variation (seasonal differences, drought effects) rather than solely recording error.
  - When controlling for seasonal differences, some species had apparent increases in frequency that more likely reflect real shifts; others appeared to be under-recorded initially.
- Location and relocation:
  - Photographs dramatically improve plot relocation accuracy; metal plates are effective for relocation in enclosed land but laborious in unenclosed uplands.
  - Y plots require improved positioning methods; recommendation to annotate photographs and link to sketches, and to use metal markers where possible.
- Data recording consistency:
  - Observer differences and seasonal timing created variation; QA should occur as close as possible to initial survey to minimize season-related discrepancies.
  - Training should emphasize accurate plot size use, correct location, and careful recording of vegetation characteristics, particularly bryophytes and grasses.
- Mapping and classification:
  - The current primary landuse coding system is largely reliable for major habitat types; however, refinement is needed for marginal upland categories and wetland/bog classifications.
  - Boundary coding requires clearer definitions and separation of hedge types, with hedges treated more explicitly in qualifying codes.
- Recommendations for future work:
  - Use photographs to aid relocation; annotate and relate to ground plots.
  - Standardize and simplify landuse classification where possible; subdivide certain upland codes (e.g., 102) and add missing categories (lowland rush pasture, wet heath) to reduce ambiguity.
  - Limit mapping emphasis to the two most dominant species per parcel to improve reproducibility.
  - Target training on bryophytes and grasses; clarify tree/shrub cover recording rules.
  - Align QA activities with the same year as the original survey; maintain consistency in season and timing.

## Recommendations (Key Points)

- Recommendation 1: Retain lichens in surveys; provide training materials with species samples and habitat context.
- Recommendation 2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey date.
- Recommendation 3: Require surveyors to annotate photographs and explicitly link to plot locations; include distance to nearby features.
- Recommendation 4: Use metal marker plates for X plots in enclosed land; assess feasibility in unenclosed areas.
- Recommendation 5: Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with survey tape; orient to N-S along the side, placing at the SE corner.
- Recommendation 8–12: Refine certain landuse codes (e.g., subdivide 102 upland grassland; add lowland rush pasture; recognize wet heath as a distinct type); reduce reliance on detailed cover codes; map only the most prevalent species; improve boundary coding rules; emphasize accuracy in mapping of vegetation cover and boundary features.

## Implications for Data Support and Future Data Products

- Emphasize high-quality metadata: document season, timing, plot relocation method, and whether photographs or plates were used.
- Provide robust QA metadata alongside data products, including relocation success category, percentage agreement, and data-quality indicators by plot type and landclass.
- For dashboards and data products enabling self-service data exploration:
  - Include data quality flags by plot type, landclass, and year.
  - Offer simplified landuse codes and clear definitions to improve interpretability for non-specialists.
  - Provide guidance on interpreting species lists with seasonal adjustments or drought effects.
- Data improvements for repeat surveys:
  - Standardize the use of plates or precise markers for plot corners to improve relocation consistency year over year.
  - Ensure QA occurs within the same season/year window as the original survey to minimize seasonal biases.
  - Limit the complexity of mapping codes to reduce interpretation variance and improve replicability.

- Overall: The QA exercise demonstrates that while major landuse codes can be captured reliably, finer aspects of plot relocation, seasonal variation, and vegetation cover recording require careful standardization, targeted training, and documentation to produce robust, reusable data products for longitudinal analyses.
