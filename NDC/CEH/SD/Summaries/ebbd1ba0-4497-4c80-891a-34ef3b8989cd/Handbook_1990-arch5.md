# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

## Overview

- Purpose: update and monitor rural land use data; build a land cover map of Britain; ground-truth satellite imagery; standardize field recording to reduce observer variation.
- Scope: GB-wide countryside survey project led by ITE; 512 squares planned for 1990 (six teams from six ITE Research Stations); aims to assess land cover, vegetation, and landscape change over time.
- Data outputs: Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), maps, aerial photography annotations, and standardized vegetation data for subsequent analysis and modelling.

## Data collection framework

- Core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (including vegetation plots and lineal plots).
- Plot structure: large quadrats (200 m2) with nested sub-quadrats; additional small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) in natural/semi-natural land covers; multiple linear plots along hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides.
- Temporal design: resurvey planned to track changes since previous surveys (1977/78, 1984, 1988); permanent markers and relocation methods enabled long-term comparability.
- Data capture format: data primarily recorded in FABs and mapped onto enlarged 1:10,000 (6") maps; alpha-numeric and multi-code data codes used to maximize information while conserving space.

## Data recording and codes

- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB): central data capture tool, combining map data, ownership details, land use, physiography, boundaries, buildings, vegetation, and other landscape features.
- Coding approach: two-tier system of primary and secondary codes; alpha codes used to represent combinations of numeric codes; codes linked logically (e.g., boundary codes linked to vegetation codes); emphasis on legibility and field-based decision-making.
- Workflows and quality: emphasis on neat, legible FABs; whole square coverage prioritized; in-field decisions take precedence over later lab judgments; notes allowed for ambiguous cases.
- Vegetation and species data: large lists of plant species with coded abbreviations; accompanying bryophytes, lichens, and notable fungi recorded; 5% cover categories used for estimating percent cover; combinations allowed where species-level ID is challenging.

## Data collection workflow

- Planning and logistics: six groups of survey teams; ~85 squares per group; flexible scheduling; emphasis on minimizing travel time and avoiding unnecessary revisits; no overtime initially (time-off-in-lieu considered for large overtime).
- Equipment and data readiness: FABs, aerial photos, site maps, field handouts, weather gear, marking tools, sampling gear, and personal equipment; local station support for maps and supplies.
- Permissions and access: formal permission sought from landowners/farmers; prior letters and in-person confirmations; escalation procedures if access is refused; owner/tenant information documented for engagement and potential follow-up surveys.
- Data management flow: field data collected on-site, FABs completed neatly, photos taken, markers placed; data and samples transported back to ITE stations for processing and storage.

## Field methodology specifics

- Mapping (6.1): annotating 1:10,000 maps with data codes; primary codes required for features; use of API (aerial photograph interpretation) as supplementary guidance; field judgments preferred over post-hoc lab decisions.
- FAB filling (6.1.2): structured pages with square number, ownership, land use, physiography, and detailed vegetation and boundary entries; instructions for drawing sketches, noting ownership and contact details, and recording qualitative observations.
- Vegetation recording (6.2.2): standardized recording sheets with header fields, lists of common species (with nested quadrat entries), and space for unlisted species; complete species lists, with cover estimates in 5% increments; permanent quadrat markers and field sketches of plot layout.
- Plot types and layout (6.2.3): 
  - Large quadrats: 5 x 200 m2; nested quadrats across vegetation types.
  - Small quadrats: 5 x 2 x 2 m for semi-natural vegetation.
  - Linear plots: up to 5 per square for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides; location governed by dominant vertical feature; permanent markers used.
- Relocation and 1978 rules (6.2.4): guidance to relocate or adjust plots if land use changes or features disappear; ensure plots remain representative and non-overlapping; documentation of changes on maps and FABs.
- Species identification guidelines (6.2.5): rules for difficult taxa; acceptable species combinations provided to maintain consistency; bryophytes and lichens documented with limited lists.

## Sampling and biota

- Freshwater biota: two freshwater samples per square (one moving water via Institute of Freshwater Ecology protocol; one standing water via NELUP at Newcastle University) focusing on water beetles and other biota; precise site marking and standardized sampling time limits (maximum ~10 minutes per sample); samples preserved and transported to Merlewood.

## Photography and documentation

- Photography: mandatory photos of vegetation plots to capture general appearance and key landmarks; plot number and location clearly displayed on a board at the plot edge; imagery linked to FAB and maps.

## Procedures subsequents survey and governance

- End-of-day data checks: review FABs to ensure complete coverage and legibility; avoidance of post-hoc transcriptions unless data integrity is compromised.
- Data and sample transport: timely return of FABs and samples to ITE stations; documentation and handling procedures to ensure traceability.
- Documentation and governance: clear revision trail; Colin Barr/Countryside Survey 1990 (revised Feb 1991) authoring and oversight.

## Particular challenges addressed by the document

- Standardization: aims to minimize observer variation through detailed field handbook, definitions, and strict data entry rules.
- Timeliness and planning: structured planning and travel logistics to optimize field time; emphasis on timely data capture and relocation for long-term studies.
- Data interoperability: comprehensive FAB structure and coding system designed to support cross-year comparison and integration with other data streams (e.g., aerial interpretation, climate/land-use models).
- Handling large and complex datasets: use of standardized forms, coded alphabets, and permanent markers to ensure consistent data capture and future retrievability.
