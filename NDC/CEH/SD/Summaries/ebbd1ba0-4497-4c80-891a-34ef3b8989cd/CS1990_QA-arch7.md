# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Aims and scope
  - Quantify accuracy of field recording in the Countryside Survey 1990 and assess change statistics.
  - Explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, and other factors.
  - Relate conclusions to previous comparative work and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.
  - Provide recommendations to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics.

- Background and context
  - Field surveys involve many recorders; some variation is expected despite training and supervision.
  - Prior QA exercises (1989, 1990 partial surveys) identified issues in plot relocation, species recognition, and data consistency.
  - Focused on cover estimates, plot relocation reliability, species concordance, and land-use mapping codes.

- Methods at a glance
  - Two QA series: Autumn 1990 (21 survey squares) and Summer 1991 (photographs added; 28 squares).
  - Six plot types: 200 m2 X-plots; 4 m2 Y-plots; 1 m roadverges; hedges; streamsides; boundaries.
  - Relocation methods: sketch map, metal plates, photographs, and a metal detector; included relocation success and accuracy.
  - Within-square sampling: nine predetermined points for land-cover and boundary features.
  - Self-assessment and cross-checks: included a subset of squares resurveyed within ~12 months to separate seasonal and annual effects.
  - Data analyses included species concordance indices, percentage agreement, and DECORANA ordination axes to track ecological gradients.

- Key findings on accuracy and variability
  - Plot and plate relocation
    - 1990 Autumn QA: 71% recovery rate for plates/plots with a 5-minute search time.
    1991 QA: 65% for plates and 87% for plots; relocation performance categorized as:
      - Plate and plot relocated
      - Plate located but plot not satisfactorily relocated
      - Plate not found; data insufficient to relocate
  - Species recording and concordance
    - Early overall species agreement around 47% (1990 partial analysis); full 1990 data showed ~60.9% concordance when variants (I2) were removed.
    - 1991 reassessment indicated a real increase in mean species per plot (from ~20.2 in 1990 to ~23.4 in 1991) driven largely by real ecological differences (season, drought) and to a lesser extent assessor efficiency.
    - Seasonal and drought effects were substantial; upland plots showed less seasonal variation than lowland arable/marginal plots.
    - On a per-species basis, some apparent changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana, Alliaria) reflect genuine population changes; others reflect under-recording in 1990.
  - Sources of variation (plot-level)
    - Major error types identified: mis-identifications (A), species overlooked in T1 (B), over-zealous recording (C), mis-location or mis-orientation (G/H), and changes due to season/management (E/F).
    - Approximately 39% of mismatch attributed to allocation/mismatch type, with a total overall mis-match around 60% when all sources are considered.
    - Plot-type and landclass influenced error patterns: lowland arable and marginal lands showed more discrepancies; road verges and hedges relatively easier to relocate.
  - Mapping and land-use codes
    - Primary land-use codes for major habitat and crops were generally reliable; minor categories were less tested due to low frequencies.
    - Boundary and land-use codes showed good concordance, but issues arose with interpretation of boundary and hedge conditions and with some qualifying codes.
    - Recommended simplifications to improve reproducibility: record only the two most prevalent species for mapping; reduce reliance on detailed cover codes; subdivide certain upland and wetland classes (e.g., upland grasslands, wet heath) for clarity.
  - Cover estimates
    - Visual estimates of cover (>5%) were compared; several species showed small but significant differences between 1990 and 1991 in certain land classes.
    - Overall, a heavy emphasis on cover beyond the most prevalent species contributed to variability; recommendation to focus on dominant species for mapping consistency.
  - DECORANA and land-class gradients
    - Axis 1 shifts suggested a general gradient from upland to lowland vegetation; long-term trends (1978–1990) largely supported by 1990–1991 data, with year-to-year variation more pronounced in marginal areas.
    - Across time, plot types (X, roadverges, hedges, streamsides) displayed consistent directional changes, with upland moorlands remaining relatively stable.
  - Mapping of land cover and boundaries
    - Primary codes for land-use and boundary features were applied with fairly high agreement (roughly 88–89% overall) across time.
    - Some discrepancies arose from interpretation of complex land uses (bog/moorland, upland grassland vs. improved pasture) and from boundary codes (hawthorn-dominated hedges vs. mixed hedges).
    - Recommended code corrections and additions (see Recommendations) to improve consistency and align with vegetation classifications.

- Practical implications for GIS and data products
  - Location accuracy and ground-truthing are critical for reliable GIS analyses; relocation success varied by plot type and landclass.
  - Photographs and metal markers substantially improve plot relocation, especially in unenclosed land; maintain and standardize this practice.
  - Consistent timing of QA with the original survey year reduces seasonal biases; avoid cross-year comparisons when possible.
  - Mapping work should emphasize primary land-use codes and dominant vegetation characteristics; simplify coding to improve reproducibility and comparability over time.
  - Documentation should include explicit references to plot positioning, nearby features, distances, and bearings to facilitate future relocation.

- Recommendations (organized by theme)
  - Data and fieldwork practices
    - Recommendation 1: Retain lichens in general surveys; provide training samples and habitat information to improve identification accuracy, especially for bryophytes.
    - Recommendation 2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey date to minimize seasonal and inter-annual variability.
    - Recommendation 3: Surveyors should annotate photographs and relate them to the plot; include distances to nearby features and ensure clear sketch-to-photograph linkage.
    - Recommendation 4: Use metal marker plates to mark X plots where feasible, particularly in enclosed land.
    - Recommendation 5: Define 4 m2 Y plots with a survey tape, orient sides NS rather than diagonally, and place plates at the SE corner.
  - Plot positioning and relocation
    - Recommendation: Improve ground-positioning techniques for quadrats, with photographs showing the area and nearby distinguishing features; annotate plots accordingly.
  - Taxonomic and cover practices
    - Recommendation: Target grasses and bryophytes in training; restrict cover coding emphasis to the most prevalent species to improve comparability.
  - Land-use coding and mapping
    - Recommendation 8: Sub-divide upland grassland (102) into upland improved meadow/pasture and upland grassland; distinguish wetland and bracken-rich types.
    - Recommendation 9: Introduce a lowland rush pasture code.
    - Recommendation 10: Recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type with a primary code.
    - Recommendation 11: Restrict the primary boundary code to hedge; capture species composition via qualifying codes.
    - Recommendation 12: Record only the two most prevalent species for land-use mapping; de-emphasize detailed cover codes to improve reproducibility.
  - Data structure and future QA
    - Ensure three-way comparisons (same squares/lands) with consistent timeframes; align landclass aggregates for analysis (LC, LG, MA, UP).
    - Consider expanding primary codes and simplifying complex qualifying codes to reduce interpretive variability.
    - Provide targeted training materials on bryophyte and grass identification, and on distinguishing similar taxa.

- Overall conclusion for GIS practitioners
  - The 1990 Countryside Survey QA demonstrates that substantial improvements in data reliability emerge when ground-truthing (plates/photography), standardized plotting conventions, and careful timing are integrated into field workflows.
  - For GIS-based products, prioritize robust geolocation (location certainty and documentation), standardized land-use coding, and dominance-focused vegetation mapping to maximize reproducibility across surveys and years.
  - The study offers concrete, actionable recommendations to enhance data quality, metadata richness, and the interpretability of land-use and vegetation-change analyses in map-based data products.
