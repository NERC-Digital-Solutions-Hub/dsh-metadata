# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- The document reports the quality assurance (QA) exercise carried out for the 1990 Countryside Survey, presenting the scope, results, and recommendations to improve accuracy and confidence in the survey statistics.

## Aims of the QA Exercise
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey and the accuracy of change statistics.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, season, plot location, and other factors.
- Relate QA conclusions to previous comparative work and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Methods and Design
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares assessed by two independent assessors using original sketch maps for plot relocation.
  - 1991: Expanded QA with photographs of plots and a broader set of squares; assessors visited 1 km squares representing the 32 terrain classes; included self-assessment of some squares.
- Plot types assessed (six types, subdivided into quadrats and linear plots):
  - Quadrats: 200 m² (X-plots) and 4 m² (Y-plots)
  - Linear plots: roadverges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries; additional variations in enclosed land.
- Relocation tests:
  - Relocating buried plates marking quadrats.
  - Use of sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors to relocate plates and plots.
- Data comparisons and metrics:
  - Species concordance between T1 (original survey) and T2 (QA).
  - Indices of agreement: percentage agreement, agreement, % accuracy (adjusted for seasonal/annual effects and misidentifications).
  - Initial efficiency of recording (% accuracy) and subsequent improvements.
- Mapping and land-use coding:
  - Primary land-use codes, boundary codes, and descriptive qualifiers were tested for concordance across surveys.
  - Point-in-square comparisons for land-use codes and boundary features.
- Additional analyses:
  - DECORANA (first axis) to assess ecological gradient shifts.
  - Frequency analyses for prevalent species and groups to assess changes between years.

## Key Findings

- Recording accuracy and species concordance
  - The full 1990 QA/1991 QA analyses yielded an overall concordance around 60–61% for species lists between T1 and T2; initial analyses indicated lower agreement earlier.
  - The initial efficiency of recording (percent accuracy) for the 1990 survey averaged about 58%, rising toward an achievable maximum around 79% with standardized methods and experienced recorders.
  - Seasonal and annual differences contributed substantially to observed changes in species lists, with drought year 1990 vs. a more normal 1991 affecting species presence, detection, and reporting.
  - Across all plots, an increase in mean species per plot from 1990 to 1991 was observed, suggesting real ecological changes and/or increased recording efficiency; not all of the increase is attributable to observer improvement (roughly a portion attributed to genuine ecological change).
  - The pattern of species frequency changes varied by plot type; some apparent changes were influenced by seasonal effects or management practices (e.g., crop changes, herbicides).

- Plot relocation and use of photographs
  - Relocating buried plates and plots was generally feasible, but certain plot types (notably Y-plots) posed greater relocation challenges.
  - Photographs substantially improved relocation accuracy, particularly for plots in unenclosed land; they helped re-establish exact positions and reduced reliance on sketch maps alone.
  - The use of metal reference plates for X-plots improved relocation in enclosed land, though relocation in unenclosed uplands remained time-consuming.
  - Recommendations emphasize annotating photographs, linking photos to sketches, and including distance to nearby features (and compass bearings) to aid relocation.

- Cover estimates and species identification
  - Visual cover estimates (for species >5%) were compared between T1 and T2. Some species showed significant differences in cover, but results varied by landclass and plot type.
  - Grasses and bryophytes were identified as areas needing improved training for accurate identification and cover estimation; bryophytes were often under-recorded in some habitats.
  - The data suggest that focusing on the most prevalent species at a point improves reproducibility of mapping and analyses.

- Land-use and boundary coding
  - Primary land-use codes showed high concordance (roughly 88–95%); boundaries also showed good concordance (~80–83%), but some variation arose from interpretive differences in boundary codes and descriptive qualifiers.
  - Some codes were poorly defined or inconsistently applied (e.g., marsh/wetland, upland classifications, and certain hedge/forb codes). These led to mismatches and suggested code refinements.
  - Recommendations include subdividing certain upland codes (e.g., upland grassland), recognizing wet heath as a distinct type, and restricting/clarifying boundary codes to reduce ambiguity.
  - Mapping of land-use and vegetation cover at points showed high concordance for lowland areas but greater variability in upland vegetation, partly due to location difficulties in unenclosed areas.

- Mapping of species cover
  - Concordance for dominant species at a point was relatively high (about 81% for dominant species across points), but co-dominant species showed much lower concordance (around 34%).
  - Recommendation: record the two most prevalent species and simplify cover recording to improve reproducibility.

- DECORANA analysis and ecological gradients
  - Axis 1 changes between 1990 and 1991 generally aligned with expectations from longer-term land-use and vegetation-change trends, with upland areas showing more stability and lowland areas more dynamic due to agricultural practices and climate.
  - Overall shifts suggested a continuing gradient from certain vegetation types toward more eutrophic conditions in some land classes; however, year-to-year variability and plot relocation issues contributed to scatter.

- Overall implications by plot type and land class
  - No significant differences in accuracy by plot type at the aggregate level; significant variation existed by land-class (with lowland arable and lowland agricultural grassland generally showing lower accuracy, possibly due to higher species diversity and flux in those areas).
  - The UP (upland) land-class showed distinctive vegetation and a more stable axis score, reflecting moors/heaths/bogs with less practice-driven change.

- Temporal and climatic context
  - Analyses across three time points (1978, 1990, 1991 QA) indicate that the observed axis shifts are broadly consistent with longer-term ecological trends, with year-to-year variation likely influenced by drought and seasonal effects.

## Conclusions Regarding Future Surveys

- Photographs are a crucial aid for plot relocation, especially in unenclosed land; proper annotation and inclusion of nearby features dramatically improve relocation efficiency.
- Distances and compass bearings should be recorded on sketches to improve relocation; time should be allocated for annotating photographs during fieldwork.
- Metal marker plates for X-plots are effective; relocation in unenclosed uplands remains time-intensive and may require additional personnel.
- The Y-plots require improved quadrat positioning techniques and a requirement to photograph location with clear context; a standardized, ground-truthing-based approach is emphasized.
- Species identification, particularly grasses and bryophytes, requires targeted training; consider expanding lists of allowable bryophytes for habitat-specific surveys.
- QA should be conducted in the same year as the original survey to minimize seasonal and climatic confounding effects; if not possible, analyses must carefully account for such differences.
- Land-use mapping codes should be refined and expanded to reduce ambiguity; mapping should focus on the most prevalent species for reproducibility, with a simplified approach to cover coding.
- Emphasize recording of the two most prevalent species per land parcel to improve mapping reproducibility.
- Future QA should distinguish and quantify sources of variation (misidentifications, overlooked species, seasonal/management changes, and relocation errors) to better interpret change statistics.

## Recommendations Highlight (Selected)

- Recommendation 1: Retain lichens in general surveys (with minor modifications) and provide training materials and habitat information for familiarization.
- Recommendation 2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey timing.
- Recommendation 3: Surveyors should annotate photographs and relate them to plots; include distances and compass bearings; use metal plates to mark key plots in enclosed land.
- Recommendation 4: (Implied by context) Improve Y-plot positioning and add precise ground-location techniques; use photographs to aid relocation.
- Recommendation 5: Define 4 m² (Y) plots with a survey tape, orient sides N-S, and place at the SE corner; use consistent orientation and marking.
- Recommendation 8–12 (as outlined): Subdivide/up-sample land-use codes (e.g., up-lifted categories), recognize wet heath as a distinct type, refine boundary coding, restrict certain forb codes lacking definitions, and adjust mapping practices to improve reproducibility.

## Takeaways for Analysts Using This QA

- Variation in ecological data arises from observer error, seasonal/climate effects, plot relocation challenges, and coding ambiguities. A robust QA process helps separate real ecological change from recording artefacts.
- Photographic aids, standardized coding, and same-season QA timing markedly improve reliability of change statistics.
- For future analyses, focus on dominant species for mapping, use two-species cover records, and ensure clear documentation of plot location, boundaries, and habitat context to enable reproducible, comparable trend analyses.
