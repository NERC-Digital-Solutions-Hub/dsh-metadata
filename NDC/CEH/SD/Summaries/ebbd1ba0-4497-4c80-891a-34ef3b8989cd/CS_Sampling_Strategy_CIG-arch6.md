# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Overview
- A long-running framework for field surveys of Great Britain to estimate habitat and land-use features over time.
- Combines an environmental stratification (ITE Land Classification) with a stratified, random sampling design to produce representative national (and country-specific) estimates.
- Evolution of the data framework aimed to improve comparability across surveys and to support country-specific environmental policy reporting (England, Scotland, Wales).

## Core Concepts
- Stratified sampling reduces bias by ensuring all parts of the landscape are represented through discrete strata (land classes).
- The ITE Land Classification groups landscape into classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to guide sample placement.
- National estimates derive from class-level means multiplied by total land area per class; time-series enable detection of ecological change.

## The ITE Land Classification
- Originated in the 1970s to classify land using environmental attributes rather than solely species data.
- Class system evolved from 32 original classes (1978) to 40 (1990) and then to 45 (2007) to support country-specific reporting.
- Initial classification informed the sampling frame; later revisions sought to classify every 1 km square in GB (with surrogates where full data were impractical).

## Sampling Framework by Survey Year
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
  - 1 km squares centre sampled within a 15 × 15 km grid; eight samples per land class (256 total).
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to form 32 land classes; surrounding four squares added for classification.
  - National habitat estimates calculated from mean habitat area per square times land-class area.
- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - 12 km squares per land class (384 total); continued use of the 32-class framework.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
  - Extended classification to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; urban/sea corrections applied; more comprehensive data for regional estimates.
- 1998/CS2000 (Revised Land Classification & Fourth Field Survey)
  - Introduced country-unit reporting (England with Wales, Scotland separately); 40 land classes.
  - Additional sampling to better represent country units; upland habitat module added to improve upland estimates.
  - Wales received targeted sampling increases to enable Wales-only reporting.
- 2007/CS2007 (Further Wales-only Adjustments)
  - Wales-specific class sub-divisions created (five new Wales-centered classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Additional Welsh squares (43 more) to ensure robust representation; some English classes reduced to four squares per class.
  - England/Scotland maps updated to reflect revised country-unit classifications.

## Country Reporting and Representation
- CS1990–CS2000 introduced country-unit estimates (England with Wales vs Scotland); Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates.
- Wales required more intensive sampling for reliable Wales-only reporting; England reductions in some classes were deemed acceptable to maintain overall precision.

## Uplands Module (CS2000)
- An additional module added 30 squares in upland/marginal upland areas to improve habitat estimates where upland data were under-sampled under the country-unit framework.

## Data Outputs and Use
- Time-series data enable detection of change in habitat and land-use features across GB and by country.
- National estimates rely on class-area proportions and per-square means; country-specific estimates support targeted policy and environmental reporting.
- Documentation includes crosswalks of classifications over time and notes on consistency challenges when changing classifications.

## Data Quality, Challenges, and Considerations
- Early risk of bias mitigated by stratification; later changes acknowledged potential shifts in representativeness when reclassifying squares.
- Balancing representation across England, Scotland, and Wales; Wales required more squares for robust Wales-only reporting.
- Consistency across surveys necessitated methodological notes (e.g., class definitions, reclassification implications) to ensure data comparability.
