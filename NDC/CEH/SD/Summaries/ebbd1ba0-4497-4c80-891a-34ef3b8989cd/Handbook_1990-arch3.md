COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Overview
  - A nationwide monitoring program to assess changes in land use, vegetation, landscape features, and associated environmental health to inform policy and future decisions.
  - Combines ground-truth field data with satellite-derived land cover maps to enable bottom-up and top-down integration and trend analysis.
  - Emphasizes standardized data collection, metadata, data quality, openness, and governance to support transparent monitoring and reuse.

- Aims and Scope for Monitoring Frameworks
  - Identify current environmental health measures and indicators that signal changes in the countryside.
  - Build current datasets for scientific evaluation of ecological systems and to monitor ongoing rural changes.
  - Link field observations (land cover, vegetation, physiography, boundaries, land use) with remote-sensing outputs for improved projection and trend detection.

- Organization and Roles
  - Conducted by ITE with six Research Stations; survey teams of about 85 squares each.
  - Station Coordinators manage day-to-day planning, logistics, and access permissions.
  - Collaboration includes field, data processing, and management activities across multiple sites and years.

- Survey Design and Sampling Framework
  - 512 squares to be surveyed in 1990; divided into six groups, with each station handling a subset.
  - Sampled areas include land cover, landscape features, vegetation, soils, inland water, and coastal features.
  - Two-tier sampling: ground-based field data (FABs, quadrats, plots) complemented by satellite imagery and land cover mapping.

- Field Data Collection Instruments and Procedures
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) used to compile data from mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling.
  - Mapping requires enlarged 1:10,000 maps with structured data codes (primary and secondary) to annotate features.
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) supports feature identification not visible on maps, with conservative guidance and ground-truthing.

- Data Codes, Coding System, and Quality Control
  - Extensive coding system for land cover, vegetation types, boundaries, buildings, roads, boundaries, water features, and more.
  - Use of alpha (letter) codes to compress multiple numeric codes; primary vs. secondary codes; dominant-use rules; standardized field judgments.
  - Codes cover vegetation, boundaries, structures, and non-vegetated features; rules for mosaic areas, percent cover, and age/dominance of canopy.
  - Emphasis on field-guarded decisions and explicit notes when classifications are uncertain.

- Plot Types and Vegetation Sampling (6.2)
  - 6.2.3 Plot Types:
    - Quadrats: five large 200 m2 plots with nested 4 m2 subplots for detailed vegetation recording.
    - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots in natural or semi-natural land cover.
    - Linear plots: boundary (hedgerow), hedgerow plots, streamside plots, and roadside plots (up to five each).
  - Location, relocation, and layout principles:
    - Pre-located quadrats on maps; relocation when land use changes; fixed relocation rules to ensure comparability over time.
    - For linear plots, placement is tied to dominant vertical features (hedges, walls, fences, ditches, banks) with minimum spacing to avoid overlap.
  - Permanent marking and recording:
    - Metal plates or markers to be permanently placed near plot corners; sketches and distances recorded; photographs taken for reference.
  - Vegetation recording protocol:
    - Nested quadrat sampling with species lists, abundance estimates in 5% bands, and notes on % cover and depth.
    - Special handling for mosaics, boundary delineations, and rare or difficult-to-identify species.
  - Species identification and data integrity:
    - Detailed species lists across crops, grasses, forbs, and bryophytes/lichens; predefined acceptable species combinations when exact identification is uncertain to maintain comparability with past surveys.
    - Bryophytes and lichens are captured with chosen representative taxa.

- Field Equipment and Permissions
  - Equipment includes FABs, aerial photos, maps, clipboards, pens, survey poles, measurement tools, field identity cards, and safety gear.
  - Permissions were sought from landowners/farmers prior to survey; procedures for refusals and partial access were defined to minimize wasted effort and to identify replacement squares when necessary.

- Freshwater and Wetland Sampling (7)
  - Freshwater biota sampling conducted for IFE (Institute of Freshwater Ecology) and NELUP (Newcastle University) programs.
  - Two samples per square from standing waters, including vegetated lakes/ponds, ditches, flushes, and bogs; sampling by sieve and formalin-preserved bottles.
  - Clear labeling and prompt transport to Merlewood for processing.

- Photography and Documentation
  - Print photography of vegetation plots to capture general appearance and geolocation cues; plot number clearly displayed on a board at plot edge.

- Data Handling, Output, and Subsequent Survey Procedures
  - Emphasis on timely return of FABs and samples to ITE Stations; minimal in-field data re-entry, with a preference for preserving original maps and forms.
  - Documentation and outputs include detailed FABs, maps, and landscape datasets, along with a robust data archive to support future re-surveys and trend analyses.

- Key Challenges and Considerations for Monitoring Framework Authors
  - Data gaps and access: ensuring timely access to data and breaking down internal data silos.
  - Metadata and data quality: establishing comprehensive metadata, QA processes, and consistent field protocols to enable reproducibility.
  - Open data and governance: balancing openness with appropriate data governance and ownership considerations.
  - Standardization: maintaining consistency across observers and years to ensure comparability of trend data.
  - Communication of complex results: presenting grid-level, plot-level, and landscape-scale findings in a clear, policy-relevant manner.
