# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- Reports the scope, results, and recommendations of quality assurance (QA) carried out for the 1990 Countryside Survey.
- Aims to quantify accuracy of field recording, explain observer/time-related differences, relate findings to previous work, and propose methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Background and Aims
- Field surveys on a large scale inherently vary due to many recorders; QA seeks to measure consistency and reliability.
- Previous QA exercises (autumn 1990, 1988/1989 trials) informed training and procedures.
- Aims included: quantifying recording accuracy; explaining differences by observer, time of year, plot location, information type, and regional factors; comparing with prior surveys; recommending methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence in statistics.

## Methods
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares assessed using sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991 (June–September): added photographs of individual plots and an expanded itinerary including 1 km squares from each terrain class; 28 of 32 squares visited; self-assessment subset also included.
- Plot types and data collection:
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X-plots) and 4 m2 (Y-plots).
  - Linear plots: verges, hedges, streamsides, and boundaries.
  - A subset of each square was resurveyed to capture all plot types; metal plates and sketch maps were used to relocate plots; nine predetermined points per selected quarter for landcover/ boundary features.
- Relocation and concordance:
  - Plate relocation effectiveness tested; various relocation outcomes categorized (plate and plot relocated; plate found but plot not satisfactorily relocated; plate not found).
  - Species concordance measured using several indices (percentage agreement, etc.) to compare original T1 data with 1990 QA and 1991 reassessment.
- Mapping and cover:
  - Landuse mapping codes and boundary features examined for concordance across time periods; cover estimates for key species compared.

## Key Findings (Accuracy and Variation)
- Species recording:
  - Initial autumn QA (1990): average species agreement around 47% for comparing T1 and QA data.
  - Full 1991 QA: overall percentage agreement rose to 60.9% when all sources of variation were considered; after excluding species that would not have been recorded in the QA period, mean differences in species per plot indicated both under-recording in 1990 and real year-to-year changes.
  - Average efficiency of recording (accounting for timings and seasonal effects) around 74% for 1990 data, increasing toward a maximum attainable ~79% with standardized practices.
- Seasonal and weather effects:
  - A drought in 1990 likely reduced overlap with 1991 data; some species appeared more (or less) due to annual/seasonal variation.
  - Analyses suggested that a substantial portion of observed changes between years were genuine ecological changes rather than recorder failings, particularly in certain soil/landuse types; in some cases, under-recording in 1990 inflated perceived change.
- Plot relocation and plot types:
  - Plate and plot relocation had varying success: autumn 1990 recovery 71% within 5 minutes; 1991 data showed 65% plate and 87% plot recovery for certain plot types.
  - X plots (relocatable via sketches/plates) generally relocated more reliably than Y plots; roadverge, hedge, and boundary plots showed differing ease of relocation; Y plots (small, 4 m2) were particularly challenging.
  - Recommendations emphasized using metal plates for X plots in enclosed land and improving positioning for Y plots (orientation, measurement).
- Error sources (categories A–J):
  - A: Mis-identifications
  - B: Species overlooked in T1
  - C: Over-recording/over-zealous
  - D–J: Locational mis-match, mis-orientation, misplacement, seasonal/management changes, and “mysteries” (unexplained records)
- Landuse mapping and boundary codes:
  - Primary landuse codes showed high concordance (about 88% overall); boundary codes also performed well (around 80–83%), though more interpretation was needed for some features.
  - Difficulties arose with marsh/wetland and upland moorland partitions; occasional misclassification of upland grassland and wetland boundaries.
  - Recommends simplifying and refining codes (see Recommendations).
- Cover estimates and species groups:
  - Dominant species showed reasonable concordance between times, but co-dominants were less stable; bryophytes/higher plants mixed performance noted.
  - Recommendation to focus on the most prevalent species for mapping to improve reproducibility.
- Ecological gradient and long-term comparisons:
  - DECORANA analysis showed axis shifts consistent with broader vegetation changes between years and with earlier ECOLUC results (1978–1988 trends), though upland plots exhibited distinct patterns.
  - Some year-to-year variability likely tied to drought and landuse changes, especially in marginal areas.
- Mapping of species cover at fixed points:
  - High concordance for the presence of a dominant species (about 81% for dominant species across nine points), but co-dominant and complex mixtures showed lower reproducibility.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- QA demonstrates the importance of standardized protocols, robust metadata, and consistent data capture to ensure policy-relevant indicators are credible.
- Photographs, sketches, and physical markers (plates) substantially improve plot relocation and data integrity, illustrating practical data governance tools for environmental monitoring.
- Seasonal timing and landuse context can heavily influence observed changes; QA frameworks should strive to align survey timing and landuse classification to minimize artificial variance.
- The study highlights the balance between data richness (detailed species covers) and reproducibility; focusing on core, repeatable metrics can improve comparability across monitoring cycles.

## Recommendations (Key Actions)
- 1 Record lichens for general surveys; include habitat context; enhance training with species samples.
- 2 Conduct QA as close as possible to the original survey in time.
- 3 Surveyors should annotate photographs and relate them to plots; include distances to nearby features for relocation.
- 4 Use metal marker plates to mark X plots in enclosed land wherever possible.
- 5 Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with a survey tape; orient so the side (not diagonal) is N–S; place at the SE corner.
- 6 Ensure photographs clearly show the plot location and surrounding features to aid relocation (in practice aligned with 3 and 4).
- 7 Include distances and compass bearings in sketches to improve relocateability in unenclosed areas.
- 8 Subdivide upland land class code 102 into more specific categories (upland improved meadow/pasture vs. upland grassland).
- 9 Introduce a specific code for lowland rush pasture.
- 10 Recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type with its own primary code.
- 11 Refine boundary coding by restricting primary boundary codes to hedge identification and using qualifying codes for composition.
- 12 Limit mapping of vegetation to the most prevalent species to improve reproducibility and reduce subjective coding.

## Conclusions
- The 1990 Countryside Survey QA demonstrated meaningful improvements in data reliability when photography, precise plotting, and standardized protocols complemented traditional sketch-based relocation.
- Seasonality and drought strongly influence observed changes; QA should be conducted in the same year as the original survey to minimize confounding factors.
- While landuse mapping codes showed high concordance, specific habitat classifications require clearer definitions and code structure to enhance consistency across survey teams.
- Overall, the QA exercise supports implementing targeted methodological refinements, stronger metadata practices, and streamlined, reproducible mapping conventions to strengthen the reliability of environmental monitoring data for policy and decision-making.
