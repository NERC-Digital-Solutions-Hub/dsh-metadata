# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

- Aim and context
  - Establish a consistent, comparable dataset to monitor environmental change and policy performance over time.
  - Build on previous ITE surveys (1977/8 and 1984) and a 1988 survey; resurvey in 1990 to update land cover, landscape, and vegetation data.
  - Use a two-tier approach linking bottom-up field data with satellite imagery to enhance ground-truthing and projection.
  - Emphasize standardization to reduce observer variation and quality control as a core prerequisite.

- Survey design and coverage
  - National sample of 512 sites (squares) divided into six groups, surveyed by six ITE Research Stations.
  - Each square allocated to a team with about 85 squares; typical survey time ~3 days per square.
  - Planning and logistics emphasize flexible working, minimizing travel, and avoiding excessive revisits; travel costs and time are budgeted, with no overtime payments initially.
  - In 1990, 128 previously unvisited squares are added; 128 squares retain prior plots for relocation and comparison.

- Equipment
  - Provided by Merlewood: Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, weatherproof clipboards, markers, surveying aids, sampling equipment, etc.
  - Local ITE Stations provide location maps, pencils, reference books, cameras, field gear; surveyors bring personal gear.

- General field procedures
  - On arrival: assess terrain, access, and problems; seek permission for full square access before starting.
  - Plan a suitable route to enable full square coverage; after recording, review notes for omissions and clarity.

- Permissions
  - Secure access to all parts of the square; obtain background information from landowners where possible.
  - Prior contact is encouraged but may cause delays; copies of ITE guidelines distributed to survey teams.
  - If permission is refused, follow documented procedures to abandon or relocate parts of the square or the entire square depending on extent; prioritize contacting landowners rather than staff; keep coordinators informed.

- Data recording framework (FAB)
  - The Countryside Survey 1990 comprises three elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter covered in Section 7).
  - FABs should be completed neatly; ensure each page has square series numbers; use pencil where possible; map units are defined by coding schemes with primary and secondary codes; multiple codes should be ordered logically (e.g., dominant primary code first).
  - Ownership and farmer information are captured on dedicated FAB pages; include owner/tenant details and a quick accessibility assessment.

- Mapping and codes (Section 6.1)
  - Mapping is the core geographical element: annotate enlarged 6" maps (1:10,000) with standardized data codes; use combinations of data codes to capture complex features; alpha codes compress multiple numerics.
  - There are primary and secondary codes; aim to annotate every feature with at least one primary code; if more than one primary code is needed, dominant use comes first.
  - Boundaries must be clearly mapped; long-term map features that no longer exist are marked with 999 (no longer present).
  - Minimum mapping unit: 1/25 hectare; minimum length: 20 m; certain features may be marked with a cross for non-map features; field decisions are final, with notes used sparingly.

- Aerial photograph interpretation (API)
  - API assists in identifying features not on OS maps (e.g., isolated trees) and updating boundaries between vegetation types.
  - Conventions: remove non-essential map features for survey use; dashed lines indicate API-identified boundaries; isolated features marked with crosses; no longer-present boundaries marked with diamonds.
  - API data is guidance and subordinate to ground evidence.

- Filling in the FAB (Section 6.1.2)
  - FABs are assembled into a Field Assessment Booklet; ensure pages are complete and well-organized.
  - Pages require series number, ownership, and detailed notes; include a sketch map and distances; photographs accompany the FAB.
  - Detailed instructions on ownership codes, tenant status, and farmer-interview prompts to gather contextual information.

- Vegetation sampling and plot design (Section 6.2)
  - Two principal vegetation plots:
    - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 quadrats per square, nested with smaller 4 m2 quadrats for finer resolution; arranged to represent major land cover types.
    - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots in natural/semi-natural vegetation types.
  - Linear plots (boundary hedges, streamsides, roadsides) to sample vegetation along linear features.
  - Permanent marking: metal plates or field-boundary markers for relocation; clear documentation of plot position and orientation; record exact position relative to map features.
  - Location/relocation rules cover 1978 and 1990 survey histories; if land use changes, relocate plots on the nearest suitable boundary while preserving representative sampling.

- Plot layout and field methods (Laying out and recording)
  - Large quadrats: use survey poles and marked strings to define the 200 m2 area; inner nested quadrats (4 m2 and smaller) are recorded first; final cover estimates are provided for species with 5% or greater cover.
  - Permanent marking and field notes emphasize reproducibility and accurate relocation; in linear features, plots are placed to reflect the dominant feature (hedges, ditches, banks, etc.).
  - Five small quadrats require random selection across suitable semi-natural habitats when possible; locations are determined after mapping land cover types.

- Vegetation recording and species data (Section 6.2.2, 6.2.5)
  - Recording involves a standard sheet with header data plus a 200-species list; additional unlisted species are added at the bottom.
  - Species data include 5% cover class estimates; tallies and mosaics are documented; bryophytes and lichens are recorded from a restricted list.
  - Acceptable species combinations are allowed where identification is uncertain; there is a defined list of frequent species used in the ITE 1977/78 survey.

- Plot types and sampling guidelines (Section 6.2.3)
  - Quadrats, boundary plots, hedgerows, streamside plots, and roadside plots are standardized; each type has placement rules and recording procedures.
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots guide position relative to features and distance from boundaries; adjustments are documented with maps and sketches.

- Freshwater sampling and NELUP (Section 7)
  - Two freshwater samples per square: freshwater biota (IFE) and NELUP-based sampling (Newcastle University) focusing on water beetles.
  - Standing waters are selected to reflect square-level habitat diversity (lakes/lochs, ponds, dried channels, flushes, bogs, etc.); samples are labeled with square, date, and surveyor; formalin-preserved samples are handled and transported back to Merlewood.

- Photography and documentation (Section 8)
  - Print photography of all vegetation plots; place the plot number marker board visibly at plot edges to aid relocation.

- Procedures after surveying (Section 9)
  - End-of-day data checks to minimize omissions; avoid post-hoc transcription unless necessary due to damage; arrange for timely transport of FABs and samples to ITE stations for processing.

- Outputs and data handling
  - Outputs include mapped data, FABs, field notes, and aligned vegetation and land-cover datasets intended for time-series analyses.
  - The methodology supports future integration with satellite-derived land cover maps and ground-truth datasets, enabling broader environmental monitoring and policy assessment.
