# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Overview
- Describes the Sampling Strategy for the Countryside Survey field component through 2007.
- Emphasises the ITE Land Classification as the backbone for stratified sampling and national estimates.
- Traces the historical development from the first survey in 1978 to the 2007 survey, including methodological evolutions and country-specific reporting needs (England, Wales, Scotland).

## Land Classification and Stratification
- The ITE Land Classification stratifies land into discrete classes to ensure representative, unbiased sampling.
- Initial approach used environmental attributes to form 32 classes; later extended to accommodate more detail and country-specific reporting.
- Stratified random sampling reduces bias and improves precision of national estimates of habitat areas.

## Evolution of the Sampling Framework

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used on 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1228 classified; plus surrounding squares).
  - 8 km squares per Land Class surveyed, total 256 squares.
  - National habitat area estimates derived by weighting class areas by mean habitat area per square.

- 1984 – Second Field Survey
  - Employed the same Land Classification framework but increased sample to 12 km squares per class (total 384).
  - National estimates still aligned with the 1978 classification.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification updated to classify every 1 km square in GB (with some changes to urban/sea corrections).
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1984 habitat quadrats plus 1978 quadrats.
  - Development of a land cover map linked to the programme.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification (4th Field Survey)
  - Land Classification updated to enable Scotland-specific reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
  - National estimates began to reflect separate Scotland reporting.

- 2007 – Revised Land Classification (5th Field Survey)
  - Wales-only reporting introduced; Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (5 new Welsh classes, 45 total strata).
  - Wales received additional sampling (43 extra Welsh squares; minimum 6 squares per Welsh class).
  - England adjustments compensated for loss of Welsh squares; two English classes temporarily limited to 4 squares per class.
  - Additional upland module introduced to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.

## Country Units and Upland Module

- Separate country estimates implemented for England with Wales, and Scotland.
- Class subdivisions created to reflect country-unit versions of Land Classes; some aggregations used where country-specific representation was sparse.
- A dedicated uplands module (CS2000) added 30 squares to improve upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

## Data Handling and National Estimates

- National habitat estimates are calculated as:
  mean habitat area per square within a Land Class × total area of that Land Class.
- Changes in classification can affect cross-survey comparability; two main options discussed:
  - Use the latest classification for consistency within a survey.
  - Use the original classification for comparability across surveys.
- Tables and figures track the number of squares, strata, and sampling rates by year and country, illustrating how sampling density and class representation evolved.

## Data Governance Considerations for Data Stewards

- Documentation needs:
  - Clear metadata on Land Classification version, year, and country-unit definitions used for each survey.
  - Provenance of sample squares, including how squares were allocated and any reclassifications.
  - Details of upland and country-specific modules and their years of implementation.
- Data consistency and comparability:
  - Note the Note Regarding the Creation of National Estimates about how changing classifications impacts consistency; decisions must align with the chosen approach (latest vs original) for GB national estimates.
- Time-series readiness:
  - Maintain linkage between successive surveys through consistent identifiers for Land Classes and sampling frames to enable trend analyses.
- Data availability and sharing:
  - Publish and preserve data at the class and square level, with clear mappings to the Land Classification used in each survey.
  - Document any changes in class definitions or sampling schemes that affect interpretation of time-series results.
- Data quality and provenance:
  - Track updates to land classification, sampling frames, and country-specific stratifications to support reproducibility and audit trails.

## Outputs and References

- Main outputs include detailed Countryside Survey results and country-specific estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) published across successive years (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007, and related reports).
- The document provides an extensive historical appendix on the development of the ITE Land Classification and its application to Countryside Survey, plus references for further reading.

## Beginning, Middle, and End Takeaways

- Beginning: Establishes the rationale for stratified sampling using the ITE Land Classification to create representative GB-wide ecological datasets.
- Middle: Documents the iterative evolution of the Land Classification and sampling framework, including country-specific reporting and upland modules, culminating in the 2007 framework with Wales-specific subdivisions and upland emphasis.
- End: Highlights implications for data governance, including consistency considerations across classifications, the need for thorough metadata, and the importance of documenting changes to ensure data discoverability and long-term usability.
