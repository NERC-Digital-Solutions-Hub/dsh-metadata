# Data overview

- What it is: Plant community data from 100 plots (1 m² each) across ten old-growth Cerrado grasslands in São Félix do Tocantins, Tocantins, Brazil, collected in March–April 2022 to compare cattle-grazed and burned sites with ungrazed and unburned sites.
- Data assets (3 files):
  - CattleGrazingCerrado1.txt: plot-level diversity, structure, cover, and biomass metrics for 100 plots (columns include site, land_use, plot, total_richness, shrub/graminoid/forb_richness, covers, dead_biomass_cover, bare_ground, and biomass by category in g m⁻²).
  - CattleGrazingCerrado2.txt: per-site average cover for 118 recorded species (zeros indicate absence).
  - CattleGrazingCerrado3.txt: geographic coordinates (lat/lon) of the ten old-growth grasslands.
- Study design and scope:
  - Two land-use categories: grazed and burned vs ungrazed and unburned old-growth grasslands.
  - 10 sites total (5 per category); 10 plots per site; 100 plots overall.
  - Across each site: 50 m transect with ten 1 m² plots along the transect; within each plot, a 0.5 m × 0.5 m subplot for biomass separation (graminoid, forb, shrub, dead biomass).
  - Measurements include species identity (field or via specialists/herbarium), growth form (graminoids, forbs, shrubs), percent cover (0–100%), dead biomass, bare ground, and biomass per category (g m⁻²); average species cover per site also computed.
- Data collection context:
  - Region: northern Cerrado, ~500 m altitude; dry winter and humid summer; 1,400–1,500 mm annual rainfall; arenosol soils.
  - Grasslands have a century-long cattle-ranching history; fire is used (burn after dry season ends) and grazing occurs during the rainy season; burned sites carry low cattle density (~0.3 Nelore ha⁻¹ at sampling).
  - All sampled grasslands were free of African grasses, with no prior soil management.
- Data processing and structure:
  - Biomass samples dried at 80°C for 48 h; data converted to g m⁻².
  - Total, graminoid, forb, and shrub richness/cover computed; totals can exceed 100% due to 3D structure.
  - Files provide both plot-level metrics (CattleGrazingCerrado1.txt) and site-level species abundance (CattleGrazingCerrado2.txt); site coordinates are in CattleGrazingCerrado3.txt.
- Provenance and funding:
  - Part of two projects: ecological/economic evaluation of beef cattle on Cerrado pastures; adaptive management of invasive species using FAPESP (Grant 2020/04713-5) and NERC (Grant NE/S011641/1).
- Data quality and usage notes:
  - Clear variable definitions and units (e.g., biomass in g m⁻², covers in %); zero values indicate absence.
  - Documentation includes sampling design and methodology to support reproducibility and cross-site comparisons.
- Relevance for data leadership and strategy:
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: field collection, lab processing, data coding, and per-site aggregation.
  - Highlights data structure that supports cross-network data discovery, integration, and reuse for ecosystem management, land-use impact studies, and biodiversity assessments.
  - Illustrates the importance of metadata richness, data provenance, and accessibility (text/tab-delimited formats) for discoverability and collaborative analysis.
