# Groundwater level observations dataset for CEH River Lambourn Observatory wetlands, Boxford, Berkshire (01/02/2012 – 16/01/2015)

- Overview
  - Dataset of logged and manual groundwater level observations for piezometers at the CEH River Lambourn Observatory wetlands, Boxford, Berkshire.
  - Period: 01 February 2012 to 16 January 2015.
  - Includes datums and ground levels for each piezometer; information largely draws on House et al. (2015a, 2015b, 2016).

- Site description
  - CEH River Lambourn Observatory wetlands, ~10 ha of riparian wetland in Berkshire (51.445°N, 1.384°W).
  - Bordered by a 600 m stretch of the River Lambourn; wetland divided into northern/southern meadows by the Westbrook Channel.
  - SSSI and SAC designation due to Desmoulin’s whorl snail and MG8 vegetation (Cynosurus cristatus - Caltha palustris).
  - Subsurface: bedrock Chalk, overlying weathered chalk, gravels, and peat.

- Instrumentation network and data collection
  - A gridded piezometer array (originally 115 locations) installed February 2012; supplemental piezometers added May 2013 (locations 16–21) to target temperature anomalies.
  - Piezometers are either peat (P) or gravel (G); exceptions where peat was too thin (location 8).
  - Gravel piezometers screened 2.5–3.5 m below ground level (bgl); peat piezometers screened across peat thickness; chalk boreholes at sites 3, 22, 23 screened at various depths.
  - Groundwater heads monitored at selected piezometers every 15 minutes using In-Situ Level Troll 500s or SWS Divers, with logging depths of 3 m bgl for gravel and to peat base for peat.
  - Quality control: manual dipping of water levels at all piezometers to verify logged data quality and drift.

- Data structure and availability
  - Continuous logged data periods per piezometer are listed (Table 1); several entries show NA where data were not collected or not installed.
  - Data span varies by piezometer; many records end on 16/01/2015, some earlier (e.g., certain 2012–2013 intervals).
  - Includes associated datums and elevation references; variations in recorded elevations are documented (see Table 3).

- Piezometer movement with peat expansion and contraction
  - Piezometers were not anchored to bedrock; concern that water-level datums could shift with peat saturation changes.
  - November 2013 and April 2014 surveys used Trimble total stations and dGPS to detect vertical movement.
  - Results show small, systematic differences by survey setup (mean differences 0.019 m, 0.000 m, 0.006 m; absolute differences typically ~0.018–0.020 m; overall variance ≤ 0.003 m).
  - Conclusion: piezometer movement due to peat compression is negligible; movement discounted in analysis.

- Data organization and storage
  - Piezometer IDs, locations, and measurement types (peat vs. gravel) are documented; data were prepared for uploading to appropriate data portals as per standard practice.

- Outputs and potential uses
  - Foundational dataset for analyses of groundwater-surface water interactions in a managed chalk valley riparian wetland.
  - Supporting studies include discrete wetland groundwater discharges (House et al. 2015a), climate-change impact projections (House et al. 2016), and groundwater–surface-water modelling (House et al. 2015b).
  - Data suitable for time-series analysis, standardised reporting, and integration with other hydrological or ecological datasets.
