# Groundwater dataset for CEH River Lambourn Observatory wetlands at Boxford, Berkshire (01/02/2012 to 16/01/2015)

## Overview
- Logged and manual observations of groundwater levels for piezometers at the CEH River Lambourn Observatory wetlands, Boxford, Berkshire, during 01/02/2012–16/01/2015.
- Includes datums and ground levels for each piezometer; summary data and descriptions draw on House et al. (2015a, 2015b, 2016).

## Site context
- Location: CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Berkshire, UK (roughly 10 ha riparian wetland adjacent to the River Lambourn; Westbrook Channel divides northern/southern meadows).
- Designations: Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC) for Vertigo moulinsiana and MG8 vegetation.
- Subsurface: Chalk bedrock with a discontinuous weathered 'putty' chalk layer, over gravels and peat.

## Instrumentation network and data collection
- Piezometer array: initially installed February 2012 (designated as site 115); additional piezometers added May 2013 (locations 16–21) to target observed temperature anomalies.
- Sensor types and installation:
  - Gravel (G) and peat (P) piezometers at most locations; location 8 peat too thin to install.
  - Chalk (C) boreholes at sites 3, 22, 23.
  - Gravel piezometers screened 2.5–3.5 m below ground level (bgl); peat screens span peat thickness.
  - Peat piezometers with screens above ground level; bentonite seals used for new peat piezometers with closed screens above ground level.
- Groundwater head monitoring:
  - Continuous 15-minute measurements at selected piezometers using In-Situ Level Troll 500s or SWS Divers, with measurements taken to 3 m bgl in gravel piezometers and to the peat base in peat piezometers.
  - Manual checks (water level dipping) performed to quality-control logged data susceptible to drift.
- Data availability:
  - A detailed table (Table 1) lists continuous data periods for each piezometer; many entries are NA where no data were collected.

## Datum stability and peat expansion considerations
- Piezometer datums could theoretically shift with peat expansion/contraction due to saturation, since piezometers were not bedrock-anchored.
- Datum surveys conducted in November 2013 and April 2014 using a Trimble 5600 DR total station and Trimble R8 DGPS, with three setups to optimize coverage.
- Findings:
  - Mean elevation differences between survey periods were small (0.000–0.019 m) with short absolute differences (≤0.020 m); systematic differences attributed to GPS/line-of-sight limitations.
  - Variance within ~0.003 m; conclusion: peat-related movement of piezometer datums was negligible for the study period and can be discounted.

## Data quality, provenance, and usage considerations
- Data are tied to published analyses (House et al. 2015a, 2015b, 2016) and earlier methodological references.
- QA/QC processes include periodic manual water level checks to validate automated logs.
- Gaps and NA entries in the data indicate incomplete coverage across all piezometers and periods, which should be accounted for in analyses and data fusion.
