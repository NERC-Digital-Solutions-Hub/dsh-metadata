# This dataset contains logged and manual observations of groundwater levels for piezometers at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology River Lambourn Observatory wetlands at Boxford, Berkshire, for the period 01/02/2012 to 16/01/2015.

## Overview
- Contains logged groundwater heads from piezometers and associated datums/ground levels for each piezometer.
- Data period: 01/02/2012 to 16/01/2015.
- Provides context and descriptions drawn from House et al. (2015a, 2015b) and House et al. (2016).

## Site Description
- CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Berkshire, UK (about 10 ha riparian wetland).
- Bordered by a 600 m stretch of the River Lambourn; Westbrook Channel divides wetland into northern and southern meadows.
- Designated as Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC) for Desmoulin's whorl snail and MG8 vegetation community.
- Subsurface: bedrock Chalk with a weathered 'putty' chalk layer, gravels, and peat.

## Instrumentation Network and Data Collection
- Initial gridded piezometer array (115 locations) installed Feb 2012; additional piezometers added May 2013 (locations 16–21) to target temperature anomalies.
- Piezometer types: peat (P) and gravel (G) at most locations; location 8 lacks peat due to thin peat.
- Gravel piezometers screened ~2.5–3.5 m below ground level (bgl); peat piezometers screened across peat thickness; chalk boreholes at sites 3, 22, 23 with deeper screens.
- Groundwater heads monitored at selected piezometers every 15 minutes using In-Situ Level Troll 500s or SWS Divers, installed to 3 m bgl in gravel piezometers and to the base of peat in peat piezometers.
- Routine manual checks of water levels performed to quality-control logged data.
- Table 1 (described in the document) lists continuous data periods per piezometer, with several entries marked NA where data were not available.

## Data Quality and Formats
- Data include continuous 15-minute logged measurements and manually collected head readings for quality control.
- Data are accompanied by datums and ground levels for each piezometer, enabling accurate head calculations and vertical referencing.
- Some piezometers have incomplete data periods (NA entries) due to instrumentation or other gaps.

## Piezometer Datum Stability (Peat Expansion/Contraction)
- Piezometers were not anchored to bedrock, so summit-level datums could, in principle, shift with peat saturation.
- To assess potential movement, peat elevations were surveyed at low (Nov 2013) and high (Apr 2014) water tables using Trimble 5600 DR total station and Trimble R8 differential GPS.
- Three survey setups showed mean elevation differences of 0.019 m, 0.000 m, and 0.006 m with variances not exceeding 0.003 m, indicating systematic error likely from GPS receiver performance.
- Conclusion: movement of piezometer datums due to peat expansion/contraction was negligible; peat compressibility with saturation did not significantly affect datums.
