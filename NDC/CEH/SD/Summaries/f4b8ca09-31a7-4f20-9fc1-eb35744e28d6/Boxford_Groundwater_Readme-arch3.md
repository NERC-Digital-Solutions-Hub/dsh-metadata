# Groundwater Observations for the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology River Lambourn Observatory Piezometers, Boxford, Berkshire (01/02/2012–16/01/2015)

## Overview
- Dataset comprises logged and manual groundwater level observations from piezometers at the CEH River Lambourn Observatory wetlands, Boxford, Berkshire.
- Time period covered: 01 February 2012 to 16 January 2015.
- Includes datums and ground levels for each piezometer.
- Descriptions and context largely drawn from House et al. 2015a, 2015b, and 2016.

## Site Description
- Location: CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, Berkshire, UK (approx. 51.445°N, 1.384°W).
- Size and setting: circa 10 ha riparian wetland, bordered by a 600 m stretch of the River Lambourn; divided into northern and southern meadows by the Westbrook Channel.
- Conservation value: SSSI and SAC due to Desmoulin's whorl snail (Vertigo moulinsiana) and MG8 vegetation community (Cynosurus cristatus - Caltha palustris).
- Subsurface structure: bedrock Chalk overlain by a discontinuous layer of weathered 'putty' chalk, gravels, and peat.

## Instrumentation Network and Data Collection
- Piezometer network: a grid array installed February 2012 (original 115 locations), with additional piezometers added May 2013 to target temperature-related observations (locations 16–21).
- Piezometer types: peat (P) and gravel (G) piezometers; exceptions noted (location 8 peat too thin to install; chalk boreholes at sites 3, 22, 23).
- Depths: gravel piezometers screened ~2.5–3.5 m bgl; peat piezometers screened across entire peat thickness; chalk boreholes screened at various depths (9.5–10.0 m, 8.0–9.0 m, 5.0–6.0 m bgl for sites 3, 22, 23 respectively).
- Recording technology: groundwater heads monitored every 15 minutes at selected piezometers using In-Situ Level Troll 500s or SWS Divers, drilled to 3 m bgl in gravel piezometers and to peat base in peat piezometers.
- Quality control: routine manual dipping of water levels to verify data quality and mitigate drift in logged data.
- Data periods: continuous 15-minute data timelines vary by piezometer (detailed in Table 1, with several entries marked NA when no instrument was installed).

## Piezometer Datum Movement (Peat Expansion/Contraction)
- Issue: piezometer elevations were not anchored to bedrock, so top-of-piezometer water-level datums could shift with peat saturation changes.
- Investigation: November 2013 and April 2014 level surveys using Trimble 5600 DR total stations and Trimble R8 differential GPS, with three total-station setups and dGPS fixed benchmarks.
- Findings: measured differences largely attributed to systematic errors (setup-related GPS limitations) rather than peat movement; mean differences across setups were small (0.000–0.019 m) with low variance (≤0.003 m).
- Conclusion: movement of piezometer datums due to peat expansion/contraction discounted; data considered stable for the study period.

## Data Structure, Metadata, and Notes on Data Quality
- Spatial and physical metadata provided: locations, piezometer types (peat vs gravel), screen depths, and nearby chalk boreholes with their depths.
- Elevation/datum data: elevations (mAOD) provided for both peat and gravel piezometers in November 2013 and April 2014, with absolute differences documented (generally very small, e.g., 0.001–0.020 m).
- Temporal data: comprehensive records of data start and end dates per piezometer (as summarized in the accompanying table) and notes on NA entries where data were not collected.
- Data provenance: linked to published works by House et al. (2015a, 2015b, 2016) and supporting methodological references.
- Data quality: multi-layer QA/QC employed (instrument-based logging plus manual water-level checks) to ensure reliability of groundwater head measurements.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates rigorous integration of continuous automated data with targeted manual verification to maintain data quality.
- Highlights the importance of assessing potential datum shifts in peat-rich groundwater settings and documenting them to support data interpretability.
- Emphasizes extensive metadata requirements (instrument type, screen depth, datum surveys, site description) to enable data reuse and cross-study comparability.
- Provides a template for reporting data gaps, instrument deployment timelines, and QA procedures aligned with governance and open data practices.
