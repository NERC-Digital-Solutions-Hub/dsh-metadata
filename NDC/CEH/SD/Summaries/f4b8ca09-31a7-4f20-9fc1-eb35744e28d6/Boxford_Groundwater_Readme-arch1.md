# Groundwater levels at CEH River Lambourn Observatory wetlands, Boxford, Berkshire

- Time frame: 01 February 2012 to 16 January 2015
- Location: CEH River Lambourn Observatory wetlands, Boxford, Berkshire, UK (riparian wetland with chalk bedrock, overlying peat and gravel)
- Purpose: Logged and manual observations of groundwater heads from a piezometer network; includes datums and ground levels for each piezometer
- Context: Site designated as SSSI and SAC, hosting Desmoulin's whorl snail and MG8 vegetation; subsurface lithology includes chalk bedrock, weathered chalk, gravels, and peat

## Instrumentation network and data collection

- Network: Gridded piezometer array originally installed February 2012; supplemental piezometers added May 2013 to target temperature anomalies
- Piezometer types: Gravel (G) and peat (P) piezometers; a chalk (C) borehole subset at sites 3, 22, and 23
- Depths and installation: Gravel screens typically 2.5–3.5 m bgl; peat screens across full peat thickness; specific sealing and screen configurations varied (bentonite seals for new peat piezometers; some peat screens extend above ground level)
- Data collection: Groundwater heads monitored every 15 minutes at selected piezometers using In-Situ Level Troll 500s or SWS Divers, with measurements to a consistent depth (3 m bgl for gravels; base of peat for peat piezometers)
- Quality control: Manual dipping of water levels to verify logged data drift; routine checks performed
- Data availability: Continuous 15-minute data periods listed for each piezometer (Table 1); some entries marked NA where data were not recorded

## Piezometer movement with peat expansion and contraction

- Issue: Potential vertical movement of piezometer datums since piezometers were not bedrock-anchored, raising concerns about water level references moving with peat saturation
- Verification: Datum surveys conducted November 2013 (low water table) and April 2014 (high water table) using Trimble 5600 DR total station and Trimble R8 dGPS
- Method: Three total station setups with dGPS; piezometer elevations surveyed (selected piezometers listed)
- Findings: Mean elevation differences by setup were small (0.019 m, 0.000 m, 0.006 m) with maximum absolute differences around 0.020 m; variance within 0.003 m and within instrument accuracy
- Conclusion: Movement of piezometer elevations due to peat expansion/contraction negligible; datums deemed stable for analyses

## Data use, quality, and references

- Data quality: Detailed metadata on piezometer types, depths, installation dates, and datum checks support robust interpretation and reproducibility
- Potential analyses: Groundwater-surface water interactions in a managed chalk valley wetland; responses to climate variability; construction of three-dimensional groundwater models and comparison with botanical indicators
