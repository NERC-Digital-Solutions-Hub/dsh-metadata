# The dataset:

- A dataset of calculated annual return rates for five seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies (East Scotland): Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, and black-legged kittiwake.
- Return rate definition: proportion of colour-marked birds observed in a given year that were also seen in the previous year; not a survival estimate and not all individuals are observed.
- Structure: one row per year; five columns with return rates (one per species, labeled by common name and suffixed 'RR'); each row also records the number of individuals seen that year and in the previous year, including new marked individuals.

- Spatial context: Isle of May National Nature Reserve; colour-marked plots vary by species and over time (e.g., puffins on a single plot; guillemots five plots; razorbills four plots; kittiwakes seven plots with declines leading to plot changes; shags initially one plot, expanded over time with additional plots in 2005 and 2013).
- Plot-level data collection: plots are visited daily during the first four weeks of fieldwork (mid-April); nest sites checked to identify breeding pairs; ongoing searches for colour-marked birds across the island to account for movements.

- Field and data handling methods: fieldwork conducted by trained staff to defined protocols; data recorded in notebooks and field data sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets; backups maintained in UKCEH directories; notebooks and fieldsheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.
- Data quality controls: databases quality-controlled at source; use of error-checking queries to verify field information and correct errors.

- Licensing and usage: free to use under a standard UKCEH data licence; authors encourage contacting UKCEH staff before publication or use, especially for publications.

- Background and provenance: part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) within the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) seabird monitoring programme; standardized methods since 1987; first return-rate data year 1988; ongoing re-marking to maintain an adequately marked population.

- Output governance: results, reports, and deliverables vetted and tracked by UKCEH management; staff encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information with customer approval.

- GIS-relevant considerations:
  - Enables map-based visualization of annual return rates by species and year.
  - Facilitates spatial analysis of plot-level data, site fidelity, and changes in sampling locations over time.
  - Requires attention to changes in plots over time and data resolution (annual), as well as potential data gaps.
