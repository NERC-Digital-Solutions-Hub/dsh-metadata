# The dataset:

## Overview
- Dataset of calculated return rates for five seabird species at representative Isle of May colonies off Scotland.
- Annual return rates = proportion of colour-marked birds seen in a year that were observed in the previous year; not all individuals are seen, and this is not a survival estimate.

## Dataset structure
- Each year is one row.
- Five columns show return rates (one per species) suffixed with 'RR' using the common name.
- Each row also includes the number of individuals seen that year and the number seen in the previous year (accounts for new marked individuals).

## Licensing and access
- Free to use under the UKCEH data licence.
- If intended for publication, authors encourage contacting relevant UKCEH staff beforehand.

## Background and context
- Seabird studies on the Isle of May NNR began in 1973 as part of IMLOTS, within the JNCC seabird monitoring programme.
- Return-rate calculation methods are described in the Appendix and have been consistent since standardisation in 1987.

## Species and marking approach
- Puffins: colour marked at a single plot (>100 marked birds).
- Guillemots: colour ringed at five plots.
- Razorbills: colour ringed at four plots.
- Kittiwakes: colour ringed at seven plots (two plots dropped due to decline; a new plot added in 2013).
- Shags: colour marked at one plot until 2005, then two additional plots added in response to population declines.

## Field methods
- Daily visits to colour-marked plots during the first four weeks of fieldwork (mid-April).
- For shags, razorbills, and guillemots, nest sites checked until all breeding pairs identified (marked or unmarked).
- After initial period, marked birds are regularly searched for across the Isle of May colony due to possible movement between sites.

## Data collection and handling
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced staff following defined protocols.
- Data recorded in notebooks/field data sheets, transcribed to spreadsheets, and backed up to UKCEH directories.
- Notebooks and field sheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.

## Data quality and databases
- All databases quality controlled at source.
- Access databases include error-checking queries to verify and correct information at the field station.

## Outputs, reporting, and governance
- Results and reports vetted against contracted deliverables; management oversight by Science Area Heads, Programme Directors, and Finance Administration.
- UKCEH staff encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgement.
