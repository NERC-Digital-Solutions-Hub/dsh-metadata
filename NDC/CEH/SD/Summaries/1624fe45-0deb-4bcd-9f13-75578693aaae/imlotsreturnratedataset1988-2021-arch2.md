# The dataset:

## Overview
- Dataset contains calculated return rates for five seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies off Scotland.
- Annual return rates are the proportion of colour-marked individuals observed in a year that were also observed in the previous year.
- Not all marked individuals are seen in any year; these data are not survival estimates.
- Each year is a single row with five columns (one per species, suffixed 'RR'), plus counts of individuals seen that year and in the previous year (accounting for new marks).

## Methods and Standardisation
- Part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), within the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee's national seabird monitoring programme.
- Return-rate calculation methods have been consistent since standardisation began in 1987.
- Colour marking started in 1987 for monitoring; first return-rate analysis year 1988.
- Species-specific marking schemes:
  - Puffins: over 100 marked at a single plot.
  - Guillemots: five plots.
  - Razorbills: four plots.
  - Kittiwakes: seven plots originally; decline led to a new plot added in 2013.
  - Shags: one large plot until 2005; two additional plots added thereafter.
- Fieldwork involves daily visits to colour-marked plots during the first four weeks of mid-April; nest-site checks extended to identify all breeding pairs.

## Data Collection and Quality Assurance
- Field data collected by trained staff to defined protocols; notebooks and field sheets used, then transcribed to spreadsheets; backups maintained at UKCEH.
- Notebooks and data sheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.
- Databases are quality controlled with error-checking queries to verify field data and correct issues.

## Data Usage and Outputs
- Dataset is free to use under a standard UKCEH data licence; authors encourage contacting UKCEH staff prior to publication.
- Outputs are presented in clear formats (e.g., reports, maps, charts) and are suitable for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals for accessibility and reuse.
- UKCEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information, with customer approval.

## Background and Context
- Seabird studies on Isle of May NNR began in 1973 (Mike Harris) as part of IMLOTS, linked to JNCC’s national seabird monitoring.
- Monitoring methods standardised from 1987 onward.

## Data Handling and Governance
- Field measurements, data handling, and reporting align with contract objectives and are subject to management vetting and tracking by UKCEH leadership.
- Output quality and timeliness are monitored through Science Area Heads, Programme Directors, and Finance Administration.
