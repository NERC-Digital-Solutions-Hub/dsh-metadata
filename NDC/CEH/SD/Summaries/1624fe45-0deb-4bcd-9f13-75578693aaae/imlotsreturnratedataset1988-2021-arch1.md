# The dataset:

## Overview
- Dataset contains calculated return rates for five seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies off the east coast of Scotland.
- Annual return rates are the proportion of colour-marked birds observed in a given year that were also observed in the previous year.
- Not all individuals are seen each year; the data do not represent survival estimates.
- Each row represents a year; five columns show the species-specific return rates (labeled by common name and suffixed 'RR').
- Each row also includes the number of individuals seen in that year and in the previous year, including new marked individuals.

## Data structure and variables
- Species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake.
- Columns: five RR values (one per species) and accompanying counts for that year and the previous year.
- The RR value represents the proportion of marked birds observed by the end of the breeding season.

## Field methods and marking
- Colour marking started in 1987; first return-rate analysis year is 1988.
- Marking effort by species (plots where birds are colour marked):
  - Puffins: single plot with over 100 marked birds.
  - Guillemots: five plots.
  - Razorbill: four plots.
  - Kittiwakes: seven plots (two plots later devoid of birds; one new plot added in 2013).
  - Shags: one plot until 2005, then two additional plots added due to population decline.
- Plot visits:
  - Colour-marked plots are visited daily during the first four weeks of fieldwork (mid-April).
  - For shags, razorbills, and guillemots, nest sites are checked to identify all breeding pairs (marked or unmarked).
- Birds may move between sites; colour-marked birds are searched for regularly across the Isle of May colony.

## Data collection and quality assurance
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced staff following defined protocols.
- Data collected in notebooks and field data sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets with backups.
- Notebooks and fieldsheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.
- Databases are quality-controlled with error-checking queries to verify uncertain field information.

## Licensing and publication
- The dataset is free to use under a standard UKCEH data licence.
- Authors encourage contacting relevant UKCEH staff before publication, especially for publication work.

## Background and context
- Seabird studies at Isle of May NNR began in 1973 as part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), within the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) seabird monitoring programme.
- Methods for calculating return rate are described in the Appendix and have been consistent since standardisation began in 1987.
- Standardised monitoring commenced in 1987; the first return-rate year was 1988, with ongoing annual marking to maintain a suitable marked population.

## Output, governance, and usage
- Data integrity, reporting quality, and alignment with contracted deliverables are overseen by UKCEH management (Science Area Heads, Programme Directors, Finance Administration).
- UKCEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgement.

## Interpretation and limitations for analysis
- Return rate reflects observed recapture of marked birds, not overall survival.
- Not all individuals are observed each year; results depend on detection within monitoring plots and may be influenced by plot changes over time.
