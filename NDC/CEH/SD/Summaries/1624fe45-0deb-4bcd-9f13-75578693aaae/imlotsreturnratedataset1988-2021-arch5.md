# The dataset:

- This dataset contains calculated return rates for five seabird species from representative colonies on the Isle of May, off the East coast of Scotland.
- Return rates are measured annually as the proportion of colour-marked individuals seen in a given year who were also observed in the previous year; these are not survival estimates.
- Each year is a single row with five columns corresponding to the return rate (RR) for each species, plus the year’s counts of individuals seen that year and in the previous year (including new marks).
- The dataset is free to use under a standard UKCEH data licence, with a request for potential users to contact relevant UKCEH staff before publication.

## Data structure and contents

- Rows: one per year.
- Columns: year; five species RR values (common name + RR suffix); counts for individuals seen in the year and in the previous year (including newly marked individuals).
- The reported figures represent the proportion of marked birds observed by the end of the breeding season in that year.

## Background and context

- Seabird studies on the Isle of May NNR began in 1973 as part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), within the UKJNCC seabird monitoring programme.
- Standardised methods for calculating return rates have been consistent since 1987.
- Standardised monitoring started in 1987; first return-rate year data appeared in 1988 after individuals were colour marked.
- Marking effort varies by species and by year; new individuals are marked annually to maintain a sufficient marked population for analysis.
  - Puffins: one plot (>100 marked birds).
  - Guillemots: five plots.
  - Razorbill: four plots.
  - Kittiwakes: seven plots (with two plots later lacking birds; a new plot added in 2013).
  - Shags: one plot until 2005, then two additional plots added due to population decline.
- Colour-marked birds (and nest sites for several species) are visited and checked regularly to identify breeding pairs and mark status.

## Field methods and data collection

- Fieldwork conducted by trained staff following defined protocols.
- Data collected in notebooks and field data sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets; backups stored in UKCEH directories.
- Notebooks and field sheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.
- For shags, razorbills, and guillemots, nest sites are checked until all breeding pairs are identified, whether marked or unmarked.
- Colour-marked birds are actively searched for throughout the island colony to account for occasional movement between sites.

## Data management and quality control

- Field data handled by experienced staff according to objective-driven protocols.
- Databases used are quality controlled from the source; Access databases include error-checking queries to verify and correct uncertain information at the field station.

## Access, licensing, and reuse

- The dataset is freely available under UKCEH data licence.
- Users are encouraged, particularly for publication, to contact relevant UKCEH staff beforehand.
- Data handling and sharing adhere to management vetting processes within UKCEH (see Output section).

## Storage, archiving, and provenance

- Data files are backed up and stored in UKCEH directories; notebooks and field sheets are archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.
- Provenance is maintained through standardized long-term monitoring practices since 1987, with documented field protocols and plotting schemes.

## Governance, outputs, and publication

- Output integrity, reporting quality, alignment with contracted deliverables, and timely reporting are monitored by UKCEH leadership (Science Area Heads, Programme Directors, Finance Administration).
- Staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature, with prior customer approval and acknowledgement.
