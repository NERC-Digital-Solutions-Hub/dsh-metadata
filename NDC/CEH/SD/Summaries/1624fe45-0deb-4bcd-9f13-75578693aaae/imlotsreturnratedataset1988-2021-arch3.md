# The dataset

- A long-term dataset of calculated return rates for five seabird species at the Isle of May (Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake) across representative colonies off the East coast of Scotland.
- Return rate defined as the proportion of colour-marked individuals observed in a given year that were also observed in the previous year; not a survival estimate due to individuals not seen in some years.
- Each year is a single row; five columns provide species-specific return rates (RR).
- Each row also records the number of individuals seen that year and in the previous year, including new individuals that are marked.

- The dataset is free to use under a UKCEH data licence; users are encouraged to contact UKCEH staff before publication or use, especially for scholarly work.

## What it measures and how to interpret

- Return rates reflect yearly re-detection of colour-marked birds, offering a indicator of short-term site fidelity and detectability rather than true survival.
- Not all individuals are observed every year; data should be interpreted with this limitation in mind.

## Data structure and contents

- Yearly data: one row per year.
- Five RR columns corresponding to the five species.
- Additional columns: counts of birds observed that year and in the previous year; inclusion of new marked individuals.

## Provenance and standardization

- Linked to the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) within the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee’s seabird monitoring programme.
- Methods for calculating return rate are documented in an appendix; standardised seabird monitoring began in 1987, with return-rate analysis starting in 1988.
- Colour marking begun at standardized plots per species; new plots added over time (e.g., kittiwakes added plots in 2013; shags expanded plots earlier).

## Field methods and data collection

- Species-specific marking schemes:
  - Puffins: a single plot with >100 marked birds.
  - Guillemots: five plots.
  - Razorbill: four plots.
  - Shags: originally one plot, later expanded to three plots.
  - Kittiwakes: seven plots (with declines prompting adjustments).
- Fieldwork: daily visits to colour-marked plots during early breeding season (mid-April onward); nest-site checks to identify breeding pairs (marked and unmarked).
- Post-breeding monitoring includes regular searches for colour-marked birds across the island, acknowledging occasional movement between sites.

## Data handling, quality, and governance

- Field staff are trained to defined protocols; data collected in notebooks/field sheets and transcribed to spreadsheets; backups maintained at UKCEH.
- Notebooks and data sheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.
- Databases are quality-controlled at the source; error-checking queries in Access to verify and correct data at the field station.

## Output, reporting, and publication

- Results and reports are vetted and tracked by UKCEH management (Science Area Heads, Programme Directors, Finance Administration).
- UKCEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential results in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgment.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks and policy

- Provides a long-running, standardized measure of seabird demographic indicators that can inform environmental health assessments and policy decisions.
- Demonstrates rigorous data governance, provenance, and quality controls relevant to monitoring frameworks.
- Highlights practical considerations for data sharing, metadata, and collaboration (pre-publication contact; data licensing; archiving).

## Key considerations and potential challenges for use in policy

- Interpretation requires understanding that return rates are not survival estimates and can be affected by detectability and movement.
- Site and plot changes over time (new plots, declines in certain plots) may influence comparability across years.
- Metadata completeness and accessibility are supported by strong governance, but users should engage with UKCEH staff for publication and data-use guidance.
