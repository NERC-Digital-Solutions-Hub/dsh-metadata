# The dataset

- Overview
  - Dataset of calculated return rates for five seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies off Scotland.
  - Annual return rate: proportion of colour-marked individuals seen in a year that were observed in the previous year; not a survival estimate and not all individuals are seen in every year.
  - Each year is a single row with five RR columns (one per species) and counts of individuals seen that year and in the previous year (including new marked individuals).
  - Dataset is free to use under a UKCEH data licence; authors encourage contacting UKCEH staff before publication.

- Data scope and structure
  - Five species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, and black-legged kittiwake.
  - Columns include common name with suffix 'RR' for return rate, plus counts of individuals seen.

- Data collection and monitoring context
  - Part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) within the UK JNCC seabird monitoring programme; standardised methods since 1987.
  - Colour marking started in 1987; first return-rate data in 1988.
  - Marking schemes by species:
    - Puffins: one plot (over 100 marked birds)
    - Guillemots: five plots
    - Razorbill: four plots
    - Kittiwakes: seven plots (two plots became empty due to decline; a new plot added in 2013)
    - Shags: one plot originally, then two additional plots after 2005 due to population decline
  - Daily visits to colour-marked plots during the first four weeks of mid-April fieldwork; nest-site checks for certain species; ongoing searches throughout the season to track marked and unmarked birds due to potential movement.

- Fieldwork and data handling
  - Fieldwork conducted by trained staff to defined protocols; data collected in notebooks and field sheets.
  - Data transcribed to spreadsheets; regular backups to UKCEH directories; notebooks and sheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.

- Data management and quality assurance
  - Quality-controlled databases; Access databases include error-checking queries to verify field data and correct errors.

- Outputs, governance, and dissemination
  - Results and reports subject to management vetting, aligned with contracted deliverables, and tracked by Programme Heads and Finance Administration.
  - UKCEH staff encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed outlets with customer approval and acknowledgement.

- Metadata, standards, and usage considerations
  - Methods for calculating return rate documented (Appendix); standardised since 1987.
  - Data description includes the proportion of marked birds observed by breeding season end; not all individuals are observed every year, and observed counts account for new markings.
