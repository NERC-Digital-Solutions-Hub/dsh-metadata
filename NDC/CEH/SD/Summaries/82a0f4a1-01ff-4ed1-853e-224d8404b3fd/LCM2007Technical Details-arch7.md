# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides land cover information for the UK in both vector and raster formats to support map-based data visualization and analysis.

## Vector data
- Most detailed product: polygons representing land cover parcels
- Attributes describe land cover and metadata on how the information was derived
- Minimum mapping unit: 0.5 hectares
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile
- Coverage: United Kingdom

## Raster data
- Five raster products available
- 25 × 25 m raster: assigns the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel
- Four freely available 1 × 1 km rasters summarise the 25 × 25 m raster
- Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation
- Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes
- Supply format: GeoTIFF
- Coverage: United Kingdom

## Further information and documentation

## Practical notes for GIS specialists
- Data can be combined and transformed to suit project needs (e.g., vector-raster integration, scale adjustments)
- Metadata and documentation facilitate correct interpretation and consistent use across projects
- Choose vector for detailed parcel-level analysis; choose raster for broad-area, grid-based analyses at 25 m or 1 km resolutions
- UK-wide coverage supports nationwide mapping, reporting, and policy analysis
