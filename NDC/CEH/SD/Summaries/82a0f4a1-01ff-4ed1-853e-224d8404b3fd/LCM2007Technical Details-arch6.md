# Land Cover Map 2007

## Overview
- Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is provided in multiple formats to accommodate different user needs across the UK.
- Includes both detailed vector data and raster summaries, with metadata describing derivation and usage.

## Data formats and coverage
- Coverage: United Kingdom (UK)
- Supply formats:
  - Vector data (most detailed product): ESRI Shapefile
  - Raster data: GeoTiff
- Scales and resolutions:
  - Vector: minimum mapable unit for land cover parcels is 0.5 hectares
  - Raster: one 25 x 25 m raster showing the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel; four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarise the 25 x 25 m raster

## Vector data details
- Represents land cover as polygons (parcels)
- Attributes describe land cover; metadata explains how the information was derived
- Documentation: Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation contains details about vector attributes

## Raster data details
- Five raster products in total
- 25 m resolution raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel
- 1 km resolution rasters provide summaries of the 25 m data
- Documentation: Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation contains detailed metadata for raster formats

## Documentation and metadata
- Further information is available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets

## How this supports data work (alignment with Data Support archetype)
- Provides ready-to-use data products that can be self-served by end users (vector and raster formats)
- Clear separation of detail levels: vector for fine-grained analysis; raster for broad habitat summaries
- Enables data blending and transformation into suitable formats for diverse audiences
- Documentation and metadata facilitate data verification, quality assurance, and appropriate usage
- Useful for informing policy work, planning, and public communication by offering accessible land cover information

## Practical considerations for use
- Choose vector data for detailed parcel-level analysis; ensure 0.5 ha minimum mapping unit aligns with research needs
- Use 25 m raster for precise habitat classification; use 1 km rasters for broader analyses or quick overviews
- Refer to the dataset documentation and tables to understand attribute meanings and class mappings before applying analyses or creating products
