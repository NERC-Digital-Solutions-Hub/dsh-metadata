# Metadata

- This dataset contains information about multiple palaeoecological proxies from stand-scale analyses of Cambusurich Wood, Scotland (Ordnance Survey grid reference: NN 62741 34679), generated to study long-term dynamics in ancient temperate woodland of high conservation value.
- Sampling context:
  - Duplicate peat cores collected using a large Russian corer in October 2020 from an 8.5 x 7 m peat-infilled forest hollow named Camb in Cambusurich Wood Site of Special Scientific Interest.
  - Microfossil analyses performed on one core set (pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, spores, and microcharcoal); plant macrofossil and macrocharcoal analyses performed on a second core set.
  - Chronology and loss-on-ignition (LOI) analyses based on the same core as the microfossil analyses.
  - Study supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (Grant NE/S007377/1).

- Implications for environmental monitoring
  - Provides long-term proxies of environmental conditions in a temperate woodland, enabling assessment of ecosystem dynamics and policy-relevant indicators over time.
  - Data are structured with standardized fields (depth, volume, counts/semiquantitative scales, chronological controls, LOI, sediment descriptions) to support integration with other environmental datasets and cross-study comparisons.
  - Emphasizes data quality, provenance, and the use of established methodologies for reproducibility and potential reuse in broader environmental monitoring contexts.
- Key considerations for use
  - Datasets include both raw counts and semi-quantitative abundance levels, requiring careful handling for quantitative synthesis.
  - Chronological controls linked to radiocarbon dating and LOI provide a timescale for long-term environmental interpretation.
  - Data are stored as distinct CSV files with explicit field definitions, facilitating dataset combination and reanalysis.
