# Local tree names, uses and species identification in Mozambique: supporting documentation

- A dataset documenting local tree names, species identification, and local uses across 17 villages in three districts of Mozambique (Mabalane in Gaza, Marrupa in Niassa, Gurue in Zambezia).
- Collected in Mabalane (May–Sep 2014), Marrupa (May–Aug 2015), and Gurue (Sep–Dec 2015).
- Data collected from forest plots and agricultural field surveys within sampled villages; local uses recorded through key informant interviews, focus groups, village surveys, and ad-hoc observations; local names standardized to a common local name.
- Part of the ESPA-funded ACES project to understand how changing land use affects ecosystem services and rural wellbeing; outputs linked to forest plot and agricultural household datasets to assess ecosystem service use and provision.

- Data content and structure
  - Dataset comprises one spreadsheet: tree_species_identification_and_uses.csv.
  - Includes:
    - survey_id: 5 = Mabalane, 6 = Marrupa, 7 = Gurue (district-level study identifiers).
    - recorded_local_name: all local names and all spellings/synonyms (with sample numbers if no local name recorded).
    - standardised_local_name: the standardized local name assigned.
    - species_name: identified genus and species where possible; unknowns labeled (unknownX_location) when not identified.
    - identification_notes: uncertainties in species identification.
    - specific_use: detailed recorded uses (where available).
    - charcoal, firewood, construction, food, medicine, cultural b, hunting b: binary indicators (yes or blank) for whether the tree is used for these purposes.
  - District-level amalgamation of uses; data not disaggregated to individual villages due to varying data intensity across villages (district-level interpretation of uses).
  - In Mabalane (survey 5), cultural and hunting uses not recorded; specific uses not recorded in survey 5.

- Data collection and standardization methods
  - Local names collected from field sources; all spellings and synonyms grouped into standardized local names by the lead author.
  - Species identification in the field where possible using keys (van Wyk & van Wyk 1997; Coates Palgrave 2003); samples collected and cross-validated by botanists at Universidade Eduardo Mondlane when identification was uncertain.
  - Identification preferred from field observation over dried samples when conflicting.
  - Data collection methods included focus group discussions, village surveys, key informant interviews, transect walks, and ad-hoc observations; Gurue used tablets and Open Data Kit (ODK) for data capture.

- Data quality control and handling of uncertainty
  - Quality assured by the first and second authors; trained field teams with translators; translations between local languages, Portuguese, and English.
  - Unknown identifications labeled as 'unknown'.
  - Standardized local name assignment performed by the lead author for consistency.

- Context, scope, and limitations
  - Data may vary slightly between survey sites due to evolving methods; differences noted in accompanying text and data descriptions.
  - Uses are not uniformly recorded across districts; Mabalane recorded broad categories, while Marrupa and Gurue recorded more specific uses.
  - Local names transferable within a district due to consistent local languages; not all species were identified.

- Related materials and references
  - Linked to other ACES datasets (forest plots and agricultural field surveys) via the survey_id field.
  - Methodological and taxonomic references used for identification and naming: Coates Palgrave (2003); van Wyk & van Wyk (1997); Woollen et al. (2016) on charcoal and ecosystem services.

- Project and funding context
  - Dataset collected as part of the ACES project (NE/K010395/1), funded through ESPA by DFID, ESRC, and NERC.
