# Local tree names, uses and species identification in Mozambique: supporting documentation

## Overview
- Documents local tree names, species identification, and local uses across 17 villages in three Mozambican districts (Mabalane, Gaza; Marrupa, Niassa; Gurue, Zambezia).
- Collected in 2014–2015 as part of the ESPA-funded ACES project, which studies how land-use changes affect ecosystem services and rural livelihoods.
- Data are linked to forest plot datasets, agricultural field surveys, and household data to assess ecosystem service use and provision; amalgamated to the district level due to varying data collection intensity.

## Data included
- One spreadsheet: tree_species_identification_and_uses.csv
- Records:
  - survey_id: 5 = Mabalane, 6 = Marrupa, 7 = Gurue
  - recorded_local_name: local tree name as recorded (includes variants)
  - standardised_local_name: standardized local name
  - species_name: identified genus and species
  - identification_notes: uncertainties in identification
  - specific_use: detailed recorded uses (where available)
  - charcoal, firewood, construction, food, medicine, cultural b, hunting b: yes/blank indicating use categories
- Notes:
  - Where species were unidentified, labeled as 'unknownX_location' (X = sample number; location indicates district)
  - Cultural and hunting uses not recorded in Mabalane; some specific uses not recorded in Mabalane

## Methods and data collection
- Village coverage: seven villages (Mabalane), ten villages (Marrupa), ten villages (Gurue)
- Sources for local names: forest plots and agricultural surveys; names and spellings grouped into standardized local names
- Species identification: in-field identification prioritized when confident; samples collected, dried, and cross-validated by botanists at Universidade Eduardo Mondlane
- Language and translation: field teams included translators; Portuguese records translated to English
- Use data collection: focus group discussions, village surveys, key informants, transect walks, ad-hoc observations
  - Mabalane: broad use categories (charcoal, firewood, construction, wild foods, traditional medicines)
  - Marrupa: specific uses recorded
  - Gurue: uses collected with Open Data Kit (ODK) via semi-structured questions

## Data structure and quality control
- Dataset structure: tree_species_identification_and_uses.csv with blanks where data are missing or not recorded
- Data linkage: survey_id links to other ACES datasets (forest plots, agricultural surveys)
- Quality assurance:
  - All data quality assured by the first two authors
  - Field teams trained; translators used; translations checked
  - Preference given to field identifications over dried samples when available
  - Uncertain identifications labeled 'unknown'
  - Standardized local names established by the lead author

## Context, provenance and references
- Project context: ACES (Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation), ESPA-funded
- Funders: DFID, ESRC, NERC
- Methodological notes: co-developed with ACES researchers; data collected by authors and local flora experts
- References: Coates Palgrave (2003), van Wyk & van Wyk (1997), Woollen et al. (2016)

## Limitations and caveats
- Data methods evolved across sites; slight site-to-site variation possible
- Not disaggregated to village level; district-level amalgamation
- Uses not recorded for all species; some species unidentified
- Certain use categories were not recorded in specific districts (e.g., cultural and hunting uses in Mabalane)
