# Dataset name, Details = Plant cover in a Floridian foredune following hurricane Irma: effect of experimental wrack removal

## Overview
- Investigates plant cover by species in a Floridian foredune following hurricane Irma (Oct 2017) and the effect of experimental wrack removal.
- Location: Anastasia State Park, south of St Augustine, Florida, USA, an area impacted by Irma and wrack deposition.

## Study design and context
- Experimental setup established March 2018 in the storm wrack zone within 1 km.
- Five blocks; within each block three 10 x 10 m plots assigned to: control, procedural control (wrack removal and replacement), and removal (wrack removal, no replacement).
- Replication: 15 plots total (5 blocks × 3 treatments).

## Data collected and variables
- Response variables: plant percentage cover by species and total plant cover.
- Sampling units: nine 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats per plot.
- Measurements: visually estimated percent cover for each species within each quadrat; total cover is the sum of all species covers within a quadrat.
- Key fields:
  - sampling_period (month/year)
  - plot_id (unique per plot)
  - block
  - plot
  - treatment_type
  - quadrat_number
  - plant_cover (total cover)
  - uniola_paniculata (cover of Uniola paniculata)
  - additional species columns (19 more species represented)

## Procedures and data quality
- Observations collected March 2018 (setup) and subsequently August 2018, October 2018, and January 2019.
- Observations conducted visually within each quadrat; total cover calculated from species covers.
- Data quality checks: distributions screened for unusual values and cross-checked against field notebooks.

## Data formats and metadata
- Available formats: Excel and CSV.
- Dataset includes descriptive headers, with fields such as sampling_period, plot_id, block, plot, quadrat_number, and species-specific cover columns.

## Personnel and site visualization
- Staff responsible: Matthew Joyce, John Griffin.
- Site and plots depicted in accompanying figures (Google Earth image and schematic of plot layout within the storm wrack band).

## Potential uses and implications
- Enables analysis of how wrack removal influences plant community composition and cover over time after a hurricane.
- Supports coastal management decisions and ecological response assessments in foredune systems.
- Clear provenance and structured metadata aid data discoverability, reuse, and cross-study comparisons.
