# Plant cover in a Floridian foredune following hurricane Irma: effect of experimental wrack removal

## Overview
- Dataset documenting plant cover by species in a Floridian foredune after hurricane Irma.
- Focus on the effect of wrack removal treatment on plant communities.
- Observations collected at four time points from March 2018 to January 2019.

## Location and environmental context
- Field site: foredune area of Anastasia State Park, south of St Augustine, Florida, USA.
- Context: Hurricane Irma struck in October 2017; wrack (seaweed, rhizomes, wood, etc.) deposited in the area.

## Experimental design
- Five experimental blocks located in the storm wrack zone within 1 km.
- In each block: three 10 x 10 m plots assigned randomly to:
  - Control (undisturbed)
  - Procedural control (wrack removal and replacement)
  - Removal (wrack removal without replacement)
- Setup occurred in March 2018.

## Monitoring and sampling schedule
- Plant community response measured at four times:
  - March 2018 (immediately after setup)
  - August 2018
  - October 2018
  - January 2019

## Data collection methods
- Within each plot, nine 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats were used for sampling.
- Visual estimation of percent cover by species within each quadrat.
- Total plant cover per quadrat is the sum of all species covers.
- Species of interest includes Uniola paniculata; data include total cover plus individual species covers.

## Variables and data structure
- Observed/recorded variables:
  - sampling_period (month and year)
  - plot_id (unique per plot)
  - block (block number)
  - plot (plot number within block)
  - treatment_type (experimental treatment)
  - quadrat_number (within-plot quadrat identifier)
  - plant_cover (total plant cover)
  - uniola_paniculata (cover of Uniola paniculata)
  - additional species columns (19 other species)
- Data are organized in a dataset with a header describing each column.

## Data quality and formats
- Data checking: distributions screened for unusual values and cross-checked against field notebooks.
- File formats: Excel and CSV.

## Data management and accessibility
- The dataset is prepared with standard monitoring data practices and is intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
