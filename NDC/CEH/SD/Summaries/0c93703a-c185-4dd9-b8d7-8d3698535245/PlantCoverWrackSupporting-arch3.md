# Plant cover in a Floridian foredune following hurricane Irma: effect of experimental wrack removal

## Overview
- Study site: Anastasia State Park foredune, Florida, USA; following Hurricane Irma (Oct 2017) with a wrack deposit.
- Objective: Assess how wrack removal after hurricane impacts plant cover, using an experimental manipulation.

## Experimental design
- Structure: Five blocks within the storm wrack zone, each containing three 10 x 10 m plots.
- Treatments:
  - Control: undisturbed wrack.
  - Procedural control: wrack removed and replaced.
  - Removal: wrack removed without replacement.
- Replication: Three plots per block across five blocks (total of 15 plots).
- Randomization: Plots within blocks assigned to treatment.

## Sampling regime and data collection
- Monitoring schedule: March 2018 (setup baseline), August 2018, October 2018, January 2019.
- Sampling unit: 9 quadrats per plot, each 0.5 x 0.5 m.
- Location specifics: Within a foredune wrack band on the coast.
- Staff: Matthew Joyce, John Griffin.
- Observation method: Visual estimation of plant cover within each quadrat; total cover is the sum of species covers.

## Variables measured
- Primary:
  - Plant percentage cover by species.
  - Total plant cover per quadrat.
- Species-level detail: Includes Uniola paniculata and 19 other species across separate columns.
- Data structure: Each record includes plot, block, plot ID, quadrat ID, sampling period, treatment type, and species-specific covers.

## Data management and quality control
- Data checks: Distributions screened for unusual values; cross-checked against field notebooks.
- Data formats: Excel and CSV.
- Metadata and documentation: Dataset includes header descriptions and detailed field definitions for variables (e.g., sampling_period, plot_id, block, plot, quadrat_number, treatment_type, plant_cover, species columns).

## Dataset structure and field descriptions
- Key fields:
  - sampling_period: Month and year of sampling.
  - plot_id: Unique identifier for each plot.
  - block: Block number.
  - plot: Plot number within a block.
  - treatment_type: Experimental treatment category.
  - quadrat_number: Quadrat identifier within a plot.
  - plant_cover: Total plant cover in a quadrat.
  - uniola_paniculata: Cover of Uniola paniculata.
  - Additional species columns: Represented in subsequent columns (approximately 19 more).

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks (for authors)
- Demonstrates a clearly defined monitoring question linked to an ecological indicator (plant cover) and a controlled experimental design.
- Provides robust provenance: explicit staff roles, site description, and replication strategy.
- Ensures data transparency and reproducibility through detailed metadata, standardized field definitions, and quality checks.
- Uses common data formats (Excel/CSV) and explicit sampling periods and variables to support data sharing, governance, and potential dashboards or reports.
- Highlights practical considerations for governance in monitoring: data structure, metadata completeness, and the need for consistent data collection to enable aggregation across time and space.
