# Plant cover in a Floridian foredune following hurricane Irma: effect of experimental wrack removal

## Overview
- A field experiment to assess how removing storm wrack after Hurricane Irma affects plant cover and species composition in a Floridian foredune.
- Monitored plant cover by species and total cover across multiple time points.

## Location and context
- Site: Anastasia State Park foredune, south of St. Augustine, Florida, USA.
- Context: Hurricane Irma (October 2017) deposited storm wrack (seaweed, rhizomes, wood, etc.) on the foredune.
- Staff: Matthew Joyce, John Griffin.

## Experimental design
- Design: 5 blocks within the storm wrack zone (within 1 km).
- Plots per block: three 10 x 10 m plots.
- Treatments per plot:
  - Control: left undisturbed.
  - Procedural control: wrack removal and replacement.
  - Removal: wrack removal without replacement.
- Visual schematic provided (Figure 1) showing plot layout and quadrat positions.

## Monitoring and data collection
- Sampling schedule:
  - March 2018: baseline (setup)
  - August 2018
  - October 2018
  - January 2019
- Response variables:
  - Plant percent cover by species
  - Total plant cover
- Sampling method:
  - Within each plot, nine 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats (total area per plot: 0.25 m² x 9 = 2.25 m²).
  - Percentage cover estimated visually for each species in each quadrat.
  - Total cover is the sum of all species covers within a quadrat.
- Species data:
  - Primary species: Uniola paniculata (signal species)
  - 19 additional species represented in separate columns

## Data quality, provenance, and staff
- Data checks: distributions screened for unusual values; cross-checked against field notebooks.
- Data provenance: procedures and field observations documented; datasets intended to be discoverable with metadata.
- Primary contact details included (staff names above).

## Dataset format and structure
- File formats: Excel and CSV.
- Key fields and descriptions:
  - sampling_period: month and year of sampling
  - plot_id: unique plot identifier
  - block: block number
  - plot: plot number within block
  - treatment_type: experimental treatment (control, procedural control, removal)
  - quadrat_number: quadrat identifier within a plot
  - plant_cover: total plant cover within the quadrat
  - uniola_paniculata: cover of Uniola paniculata within the quadrat
  - additional species columns: 19 other species covers
- Dataset includes a header row explaining each field, with explicit descriptions.

## Analytical opportunities and considerations
- Compare total and species-specific plant cover across treatments (control, procedural control, removal) over time.
- Assess time-series patterns from March 2018 through January 2019.
- Explore potential interactions between wrack removal and species-specific responses, particularly Uniola paniculata.
- Data can be integrated with other spatial/environmental datasets; consider limitations from subjective visual cover estimates and local-scale focus.
