# Species Traits and derivation of hairiness of oilseed rape pollinators

## Aim and context
- Describes functional effect traits for 57 pollinator taxonomic units (species, genus, or family level) of oilseed rape.
- Data used to assess links between pollinator traits and oilseed rape yield, in support of the related Nature Communications (2019) meta-analysis showing pollinator functional diversity and abundance enhance crop pollination and yield.
- Funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under ASSIST.

## Data scope and taxonomic resolution
- Taxonomic scope: Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera identified to species, genus, or functional level; some taxa excluded due to limited resolution.
- Abundance data from multiple field studies (studies 1–8) and unpublished data; where species-level IDs were uncertain, genus or functional group aggregates were used.
- For complex groups, functional types were used with mean trait values from identified species when possible.
- 57 taxonomic units analyzed; some bee traits are defined cross-taxon due to their relevance to non-bee pollinators.

## Pollinator effect traits (15 traits)
- Trait 1: Body length (related to size and inter-tegular distance in bees).
- Traits 2–6: Behavioral interactions with oilseed rape flowers (e.g., time spent on flowers, pollen foraging).
- Trait 7: Hairiness index (overall body hairiness affecting pollen deposition).
- Traits 8–14: Morphological traits affecting pollen retention (e.g., corbicula and scopa presence).
- Traits 14–15: Pollen availability (pollen carried in bee crops) and mouthpart structure (short, medium, or long tongues; separate category for chewing mouthparts).
- Note: Traits 8–15 are primarily bee-related but influence pollen transfer for other pollinators as well.

## Hairiness index methodology
- Hairiness index derived from scoring body parts that contact stigmas: head, thorax, sternum, abdomen underside, femora, tibiae, and metatarsus (legs 1–3 assessed separately).
- Scoring per part:
  - 0 = coarse setae or extremely short hairs
  - 1 = short but dense hairs
  - 2 = long and dense hairs
- Scores summed across 12 body parts; maximum possible score 24.
- Index expressed as a proportion (0 to 1); 0 = not hairy, 1 = very hairy.
- When species-level data were unavailable, generic or higher-level classifications were used to estimate the index.

## Datasets and metadata (files described)
- Woodcock et al 2019 Species functional traits.csv
  - Contains taxon-specific trait data and derived morphological/behavioral effect traits for each species/unit.
  - Includes mean time on flower, probabilities of nectar/pollen foraging, stigmal contact, dry pollen presence, pollen carriage traits, corbiculate structures, mouthparts, and pollen-carrying nuances.
  - Data types: categorical and numerical; some fields with NA where data were lacking.
- Woodcock et al 2019 Derivation of hairiness index.csv
  - Detailed hairiness scoring for each species across 12 body parts.
  - Hairiness index provided as a proportion (0–1); includes summed scores and per-body-part scores (Face, Thorax, Abdomen, Femora_1/2/3, Tibiae_1/2/3, Meta-tibiae_1/2/3).
- Woodcock et al 2019 Meta data describing data structure
  - Describes taxonomic associations, units, and the specific trait fields and data types.
  - Clarifies data resolution (species/genus/family level) and handling of missing data.

## Data quality, access, and usage
- Data derive from direct behavioural observations on oilseed rape and supplementary literature/datapoints.
- Traits and hairiness index are designed to be reusable across studies for monitoring pollinator function and informing landscape/policy analyses.
- Datasets are structured to support standardized reporting formats, enabling inclusion in monitoring portals and policy performance assessments related to pollination services and crop yields.
