# Creation of the WATCHForcing Data and its use to assess global and regional reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century

- Purpose of the appendix data
  - Presents basin-scale results from the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) analysis of reference crop evaporation (PET_rc) and Priestley–Taylor PET (PET_PT) across the Orange, Lena, Murray-Darling (section appears incomplete), and Ganges–Brahmaputra river basins, with additional variables (Net Radiation, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, Precipitation).
  - Covers multiple intervals (1901-1957, 1958-2001, 1979-2001) to show how trends evolve with duration and data quality considerations.

- Orange River Basin (PET and related variables)
  - PET_rc (mm/yr)
    - 1901-1957: Average 1586.19; Slope 1.2338 (significant; P < 0.010).
    - 1958-2001: Average 1604.15; Slope 0.6463 (not significant at conventional levels; P > 0.200).
    - 1979-2001: Average 1623.47; Slope -2.3898 (significant negative; P < 0.200).
  - PET_PT (mm/yr)
    - 1901-1957: Average 1114.63; Slope 0.2471 (not significant; P > 0.200).
    - 1958-2001: Average 1123.40; Slope 1.1023 (significant; P < 0.020).
    - 1979-2001: Average 1131.46; Slope 0.7341 (not significant; P > 0.200).
  - Net Radiation (W/m^2), VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, Precipitation
    - Net Radiation shows modest changes with small slopes across intervals; notable decreases in some early periods and small increases later.
    - VPD generally stable with small trends; Wind largely stable; Rainfall shows positive slope in 1958-2001 and a larger positive signal in 1979-2001; Snowfall is small.
    - Precipitation and related statistics indicate basin-scale variability with some periods of increasing rainfall, other periods showing no clear global trend.

- Lena River Basin (PET and related variables)
  - PET_rc (mm/yr)
    - 1901-1957: Average 363.47; Slope 0.1315 (notation suggests modest increase; significance not stated as strong).
    - 1958-2001: Average 366.70; Slope -0.0454 (roughly flat to slightly decreasing; not strongly significant).
    - 1979-2001: Average 366.11; Slope 0.5366 (positive; not clearly significant by the provided flag).
  - PET_PT (mm/yr)
    - 1901-1957: Average 312.82; Slope 0.1505 (positive; not strongly significant).
    - 1958-2001: Average 313.48; Slope 0.2437 (positive; moderate trend).
    - 1979-2001: Average 314.73; Slope 0.4203 (positive; moderate trend).
  - Net Radiation (W/m^2), VPD (kPa), Wind (m/s)
    - Net Radiation shows minor variations; VPD shows small increases or stable values over periods; Wind remains broadly around 1.7-2.0 m/s with small changes.
  - Rainfall and Snowfall
    - Rainfall increases from 1958-2001 (avg ~259.7 to 309.4–309.4 in later period ranges; slopes positive in 1958-2001 and 1979-2001).
    - Snowfall remains small (~25–26 mm/yr) with modest fluctuations.
  - Precipitation (mm/yr)
    - 1958-2001: Average ~1426 mm/yr; slope ~0.24–0.24 (positive but modest); 1979-2001 shows variability with a range of slopes.
  - Overall interpretation for Lena: PET_rc and PET_PT generally show modest increases in the early century and more variable or slight increasing trends in later periods; rainfall shows a tendency to rise in the later decades, contributing to evaporation dynamics.

- Ganges–Brahmaputra River Basin (PET and related variables)
  - PET_rc (mm/yr)
    - 1901-1957: Average 889.32; Slope 0.0368 (small positive trend).
    - 1958-2001: Average 869.68; Slope -2.2561 (notable decline; highly significant given the interval).
    - 1979-2001: Average 843.63; Slope -1.8416 (continued decline; significant).
  - PET_PT (mm/yr)
    - 1901-1957: Average 798.70; Slope 0.0968 (small positive).
    - 1958-2001: Average 767.99; Slope -1.2596 (decline; significant).
    - 1979-2001: Average 752.00; Slope -0.8951 (continued decline; significant).
  - Net Radiation (W/m^2)
    - 1901-1957: Average 69.75; Slope -0.0008; relatively stable.
    - 1958-2001: Average 67.01; Slope -0.1230 (decline).
    - 1979-2001: Average 65.45; Slope -0.1041 (decline).
  - VPD (kPa), Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, Precipitation
    - VPD shows a general decline in 1958-2001 and continued low values in 1979-2001.
    - Rainfall and Precipitation generally increase during 1958-2001 and show substantial interannual variability in 1979-2001.
    - Snowfall remains low, with small changes over periods.
  - Overall interpretation for Ganges–Brahmaputra: PET_rc and PET_PT trends are downward from mid-20th century onward, particularly 1958-2001, while precipitation and rainfall exhibit basin-scale variability with notable increases in rainfall in some late periods but not a uniform global signal.

- Murray-Darling River Basin
  - The provided extract includes a Murray-Darling section but with incomplete values in this chunk; no clear basin-wide summary can be drawn from the present data.

- General implications for analysts monitoring the environment
  - The WATCH Forcing Data enable long-term, diurnally resolved evaluation of evaporation drivers (PET_rc vs PET_PT) across major basins, highlighting how different formulations respond to changing climate forcings.
  - PET_rc and PET_PT diverge in many basins, especially in mid- to late-20th century, underscoring the importance of method choice for basin-scale water-resource assessments.
  - Regional trends can diverge from global averages; some basins show increasing PET signals while others show declines, often linked to changes in net radiation, vapor pressure deficit, wind, and precipitation.
  - Early-century (1901-1957) results tend to carry greater uncertainty due to data sparsity and methodology; later periods (1958-2001) provide more robust signals but still exhibit substantial regional variability.
  - For monitoring and policy analysis, PET_rc is often more robust in humid regions, while PET_PT may diverge in arid regions; basins should be interpreted with attention to local hydroclimate and data quality.
  - The data support basin-scale and regional analyses of evaporation drivers, enabling assessment of climate-change impacts on water resources and informing resource management decisions.

- Access and use notes
  - Results form part of the WATCH framework, with bias corrections and validation documented in related technical materials; caution advised when interpreting 1901-1957 results due to limited observations and potential biases.
