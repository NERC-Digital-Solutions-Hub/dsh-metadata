# Creation of the WATCHForcing Data and its use to assess global and regional reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century.

- Overview
  - Presents the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) framework used to drive land surface and hydrological models across the 20th century.
  - Provides meteorological forcing variables at sub-daily to daily resolutions and describes bias corrections, data sourcing (ERA-40, GPCC, CRU, HadGEM2-A aerosols), and interpolation schemes.
  - Distinguishes two main periods for analysis: 1958–2001 ( ERA-40 based with extensive bias corrections) and 1901–1957 (constructed by reordering ERA-40 data to preserve statistical properties).
  - Includes reference evapotranspiration estimates: PET_rc (Penman-Monteith, reference crop) and PET_PT (Priestley-Taylor), with guidance on when to use each.
  - Validates against FluxNET data, noting generally good agreement for temperature and radiation, varied performance for precipitation, and regional data limitations (tropics and high latitudes).

- Methodology and data design notes (relevant to data support)
  - The data are designed to enable analysis of PET_rc, PET_PT, NetRad, VPD, wind, and moisture balance across key basins and time slices (1901–1957; 1958–2001; 1979–2001).
  - Adjusted Slope P-values indicate statistical significance levels (e.g., <0.001, <0.020, <0.200, or >0.200). Neff indicates effective sample size for slope statistics.
  - Some basin entries in this excerpt have incomplete fields for certain intervals (notably Murray-Darling) and should be treated as missing or cautioned in analysis.
  - The ERA-40 basis year ordering (Appendix Table 1) explains the randomization scheme used to create the 1901–1957 forcing record, intended to preserve statistical properties rather than exact historical sequences.

- Practical data-use notes for Data Support
  - Use PET_rc for energy- and humidity-driven hydrological modeling; use PET_PT as a complementary metric in humid regions with care for period-specific biases.
  - Be mindful of period-specific significance and method limitations: early periods (1901–1957) are constructed to preserve statistics, not exact events, which affects interpretation of decadal trends.
  - Regional patterns show substantial variability across basins and variables; ensure basin-specific context when integrating into dashboards, reports, or data products.
  - Validation context: FluxNET alignment supports general reliability for temperature and radiation fields, but precipitation fields remain more challenging at sub-daily scales.
