# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field work from 1978 through 2007.
- Emphasizes stratified, random sampling on a national scale to produce representative ecological and habitat estimates for Great Britain, with increasing emphasis on country-specific (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales-only) reporting.
- Highlights the link between classification, sampling, and the production of national and regional habitat statistics.

## Core concepts and foundations
- Stratification and random sampling are used to reduce bias and ensure representative sampling across diverse landscapes.
- ITE Land Classification: an environmental stratification system developed to group land based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to guide sampling.
- Sampling units evolved from 1 km squares (the basic sample unit) to more complex country-specific schemes as reporting needs changed.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) was an early multivariate technique used to classify vegetation/quadrat data into land classes that could be scaled up.

## Chronology of the sampling framework

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
- 32 ITE Land Classes defined from environmental data for 1 km squares (centre of 15 × 15 km grid).
- 8 sampled squares per class (total 256), surveying vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
- National habitat estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per square with land-class areas.

### 1984 – Second Field Survey
- Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
- National estimates continued to rely on the original 1978 Land Classification.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990) and 3rd Field Survey
- Land Classification updated to classify every square in GB; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
- 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 quadrats plus additional features recorded.

### 1998–2000 – Revised Land Classification and CS2000
- Land Classification updated to improve regional and local estimates; 40 classes introduced.
- Need for separate country estimates emerged (England & Wales vs. Scotland).
- Framework modifications:
  - Sub-division of classes into country-unit versions (England with Wales; Scotland).
  - Aggregation of underrepresented rump classes to maintain representation.
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes (including Welsh-focused adjustments).
  - Isle of Man squares replaced to align with country-unit reporting.
- Upland module introduced: 30 extra squares in upland areas to improve accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- CS2000 total sampling details provided by class, country, and sampling rate, with Wales receiving notably increased sampling to support Wales-specific reporting.

### 2007 – Developments for Wales-only Reporting (CS2007)
- Welsh reporting requirements intensified following devolution; further Wales-focused adjustments implemented.
- Country-unit land-class subdivisions expanded (creating five new Wales- or England-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
- Total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh samples (43 extra squares) raised minimum representation to 6 squares per Welsh class.
- England adjustments maintained, with some classes remaining at lower square counts due to precision considerations.
- Wales and England/Scotland distributions mapped to updated England-with-Wales and Scotland land-class maps.

## National estimates and considerations
- Note on national estimates: changing the underlying land-class framework affects cross-survey consistency; practitioners prefer applying the latest classification for GB estimates within a survey while recognizing differences across surveys.
- The document includes detailed tables illustrating per-class and per-country sample sizes and sampling rates for each survey iteration, underscoring the shift toward country-specific reporting and the ongoing need to balance precision with representativeness.

## Data collection scope and outputs
- Across iterations, outputs include:
  - Classified land strata maps and corresponding sampling frames.
  - Field survey data per square (habitat features, vegetation, land use, etc.).
  - National and country-specific estimates of habitat areas and land cover through time.
- Outputs support trend analysis and policy-relevant reporting at GB, England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only levels.

## Appendix (brief history of the ITE Land Classification)
- Outlines the five major survey milestones (1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) and how the Land Classification and sampling frames were revised at each stage.
- Highlights how early classifications used 1 km squares and how later revisions enabled country-specific reporting and enhanced alignment with policy needs.
