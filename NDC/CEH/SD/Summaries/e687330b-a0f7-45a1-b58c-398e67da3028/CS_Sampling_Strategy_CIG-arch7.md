# THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Built on the ITE Land Classification; purpose is to produce representative, time-series data and enable detection of change across Britain.
  - Emphasizes stratified, random sampling to reflect ecological variation and avoid bias; supports mapping and GIS-based presentation of habitat features.

- Core concept: ITE Land Classification
  - Originated in the 1970s to stratify GB landscapes for ecological survey.
  - 1978: 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes; based on 1 km squares (center square of a 15x15 km grid classified; surrounding squares also allocated).
  - 1984: framework extended to land use and habitat mapping; sample increased.
  - 1990: land classification extended to classify every square in GB (All Squares approach); satellite-derived land cover map linked to the program.
  - 1998–2000: classification refined to allow country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) with increases in class numbers (up to 40, then adjusted for country units).

- Survey history and sampling evolution
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per land class) surveyed; habitat areas estimated by class means times class area.
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class); continued use of the earlier 32-class framework for national estimates.
  - CS1990: all GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; added land cover data; results reported using the 1990 classification.
  - CS2000: country-specific reporting introduced; land classes subdivided into country-unit versions; total strata expanded to 40; 34–43 additional squares allocated to ensure representation of new classes; uplands module planned to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - CS2007: Wales-specific reporting requirements led to further refinements; five new Welsh country-unit classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares allocated; England adjustments (some classes with fewer squares) deemed acceptable for precision; Wales-focused sampling intensified.

- Country-specific arrangements and upland module
  - Separate country estimates implemented for England with Wales and for Scotland; Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates and replaced by additional English squares.
  - Uplands module added in CS2000/CS2007 to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales (30 extra squares).

- Data products, maps and outputs
  - Land Classification maps updated over time (1978 original maps; 1990 “new” classification map; 2000 revised maps for England with Wales and Scotland; 2007 revised maps for England, Wales and Scotland).
  - Sampling figures and tables document the distribution of squares across classes and years (e.g., total GB square counts, sample sizes per survey, and sampling rates by class).

- Important notes on comparability and national estimates
  - Changing the basic land classification affects national stock estimates; consistency can be achieved by choosing a single approach per survey, with cross-survey comparability improved by using the latest classification within a survey but recognizing differences across surveys.
  - Table 4 illustrates how sample sizes per class have varied across surveys when using the original 1990 classification.

- Key figures and tables (described)
  - Maps associated with original and revised land classifications across time (1978, 1990, 2000, 2007) and the corresponding sample squares.
  - Table 3 (CS2007) summarises the numbers of squares surveyed by England, Scotland, and Wales across the 45 strata.
  - Table 4 compares the number of squares per class across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 using the Original (1990) Land Classification.
  - An appendix provides a brief history of the ITE Land Classification and a chronological summary of the surveys.
