# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the development and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) from 1978 through 2007.
- Emphasizes progression from a small, stratified sample to a comprehensive, country-specific reporting framework, while maintaining a link to historical data for trend detection.
- Aims to provide representative, repeatable estimates of habitat areas across Great Britain and its constituent countries (England, Scotland, Wales), with increasing emphasis on Wales- and Scotland-only reporting.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification
- Early basis: stratified, random sampling using land classification to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
- 1978 CS: 32 ITE Land Classes created from 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid) using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA); 8 squares per class surveyed (256 total).
- 1984 CS: sample size increased by 50% (12 squares per class); ongoing use of the original 32-class framework.
- 1990 CS: Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all 1 km squares; first attempt to link with a land cover map; 508 squares surveyed; results published for CS1990.
- 1998 CS: Land Classification updated to enable separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to 40; 569 squares surveyed; groundwork for regional estimates.
- 2000 CS (CS2000): further refinements to support separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland); creation of country-unit versions of classes; introduction of class sub-division and aggregation to ensure adequate representation; 40 strata expanded to 40–46 by country; upland habitat module added for England & Wales to improve upland estimates.
- 2007 CS: Welsh-only reporting requires additional Welsh sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and more Welsh squares; England adjustments do not mirror Wales reductions; total strata increased to 45; Wales receives enhanced representation to support Wales-only reporting.

## Sampling Framework and Survey Design
- Core approach: stratified, random sampling using the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation across GB.
- Survey units: 1 km squares as the primary sampling units; selection within land classes to ensure each stratum contributes to national estimates.
- Class structure:
  - Original: 32 Land Classes (CS1978–CS1984 remains aligned to 32 classes).
  - 1990: expansion to 40 classes to improve regional detail.
  - 2000: subdivision into country-unit classes (England+Wales, Scotland) and further refinements to support country-specific reporting.
  - 2007: further Welsh subdivision creating 45 strata.
- Sample sizes:
  - CS1978: 8 squares per class (256 total).
  - CS1984: 12 squares per class (384 total).
  - CS1990: 508 squares surveyed; additional squares allocated to larger classes; some reallocation to reflect all-GB classification.
  - CS2000: total squares and class distribution adjusted for England, Wales, and Scotland; additional upland module included.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused adjustments; additional Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation in new Welsh classes; some English classes maintain lower counts due to precision considerations.
- Country-specific adjustments:
  - England, Scotland, and Wales (and Isle of Man adjustments) incorporated to enable country-unit estimates.
  - Wales receives the most intensive sampling in CS2000/CS2007 due to policy and reporting needs.
  - Upland habitat module added for England & Wales to improve upland estimates in country reports.

## Estimation Approach
- National estimates:
  - For each Land Class, estimate area using the mean habitat area per square multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - Aggregation across all classes yields national habitat estimates for GB.
- Country-specific estimates:
  - Estimates are derived using squares restricted to the country in question (England+Wales or Scotland), with class subdivisions and aggregations ensuring adequate representation in each country.
  - Some classes are split or aggregated to maintain meaningful comparisons within each country unit.
- Comparability and consistency:
  - The 2006 scoping study cautions that changing the underlying Land Classification affects the consistency of stock estimates; two approaches are noted for GB comparability:
    - Use the latest country-specific classification for GB estimates (better internal consistency for each survey).
    - Use the original 1990 classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - Guidance suggests preferring the latest classification for consistency within an individual survey, but recognizing trade-offs for cross-survey comparability.

## Wales/Scotland and Upland Focus
- Wales:
  - Wales-specific reporting requires additional Welsh classes and more Welsh sampling squares.
  - Wales sub-division of Land Class 17 is implemented to enhance Welsh results.
- Scotland:
  - Scotland-specific results continue to be supported within the retained framework; occasional re-alignment with updated classifications to maintain Scotland-relevant reporting.
- Uplands:
  - An additional CS2000 uplands module funded to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England & Wales, supporting more reliable country-based upland statistics.

## Practical Implications for Monitoring Framework Authors
- Long-term continuity:
  - Maintain a clear link between current sampling framework and historical classifications to enable valid trend analysis.
  - Document classification changes and their impact on comparability and national estimates.
- Stratification and representativeness:
  - Use stratified random sampling to minimize bias and to reflect ecological variability across large geographic areas.
  - Adjust sampling intensity for under-represented or policy-relevant regions or classes (e.g., Wales) to support country-specific decision-making.
- Data governance considerations:
  - When classifications change, provide transparent notes on how estimates are derived and how comparability is maintained or explained.
  - Ensure documentation of class definitions, country-unit subdivisions, and sampling allocations to support reproducibility and governance.
- Policy and reporting alignment:
  - Design sampling and classification schemes to meet country-specific policy needs (England+Wales, Scotland, Wales-only reporting) while preserving a coherent GB-wide framework.
- Data quality and metadata:
  - Track metadata for class definitions, sampling frames, and any reclassifications to enable accurate interpretation and reuse of datasets in dashboards, reports, and policy evaluations.
