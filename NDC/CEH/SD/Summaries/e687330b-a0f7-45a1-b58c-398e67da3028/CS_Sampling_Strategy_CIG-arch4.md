# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Overview
- Describes the evolution of the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey fieldwork up to 2007.
- Traces the development of the ITE Land Classification and its application to successive surveys (1978–2007).
- Explains how stratified, random sampling of 1 km squares underpins national habitat and land-use estimates, and how country-specific reporting has shaped the methodology.

## Core concepts: Stratification and Land Classification
- Stratified, random sampling is used to ensure samples are representative of Britain’s diverse landscapes.
- The ITE Land Classification groups 1 km squares into land classes based on environmental attributes, allowing consistent estimation of habitat/land-use features.
- Early work used centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; surrounding squares were included to extend classification.

## History and progression of the ITE Land Classification
- 1978: First version with 32 land classes, based on environmental variables; 1228 centre squares classified; surrounding squares added for a total of 6039 squares.
- 1984: Second field survey; number of squares per class increased to improve national estimates; 384 squares surveyed (12 per class).
- 1990: All Squares Land Classification implemented; integrated data from all 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; linked with the first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998: Major revision to support regional and national estimates; 40 land classes; groundwork for separate Scotland reporting.
- 2000: Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland); land classes subdivided to create country-unit versions; 40 → 45 strata; uplands module planned to improve upland habitat estimates.
- 2007: Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) added Wales-only reporting adjustments; five new Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation; some English classes reduced to maintain balance; overall 45 strata maintained; Wales becomes a primary focus for country-specific reporting.

## Country-specific reporting and upland emphasis
- Separate country estimates required for England & Wales together and for Scotland; adjustments included subdividing land classes by country unit and adding targeted samples.
- CS2000 introduced upland habitat sampling as a dedicated module to improve estimation precision in uplands of England and Wales (30 additional squares).

## Sampling framework: progression through CS1978–CS2007
- 1978 (Initial): 8 samples per Land Class ( total 256 squares); stratified into 32 classes.
- 1984 (Second survey): framework retained, but sample size per class increased to 12 squares; total expanded.
- 1990 (All Squares): expanded to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed; maintained continuity with earlier results via revised classifications.
- 2000 (CS2000): refined for regional and country-specific use; introduced country-unit classifications and expanded to 45 strata; added upland module proposal.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-focused adjustments to improve Wales-only reporting; Welsh-class subdivisions implemented; additional Welsh squares allocated; some English classes adjusted to preserve precision.

## Data governance and estimation implications
- Note: Changing the basic Land Classification affects the consistency of national estimates; two approaches exist:
  - Use the latest classification for GB estimates within a survey, which can disrupt cross-survey comparability.
  - Use the original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency, which may hinder country-specific reporting.
- The document records a preference for the latest classification within an individual survey while acknowledging cross-survey comparability considerations.

## Outputs, maps, and references
- Includes numerous figures and tables illustrating the map-based class distributions and square allocations (e.g., revised land-class maps for country units and sample square maps) and detailed archival tables of sample sizes by class and country.
- Provides a thorough bibliography and notes on the development and application of the ITE Land Classification.
