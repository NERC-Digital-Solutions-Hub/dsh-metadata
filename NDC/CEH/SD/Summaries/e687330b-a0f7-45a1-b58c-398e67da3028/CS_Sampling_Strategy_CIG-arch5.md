# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and how it underpins the Countryside Survey field sampling framework from 1978 to 2007.
  - Emphasizes the need to understand historical methodology to interpret time-series data and changes in countryside habitats.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification (as data foundation)
  - 1978: First version used to stratify a national field sample; 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes for 1 km squares.
  - 1984: Sampling expanded to include land-use and habitat mapping; retained framework but increased sample size.
  - 1990: Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares; introduced all-squares approach with 508 squares surveyed; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1998: Further development to enable Scotland-only reporting; number of land classes increased to 40; separate reporting for Scotland established.
  - 2000: CS2000 introduces country-unit reporting (England with Wales and Scotland separately); sub-division and aggregation of classes created 40 strata, plus additional squares to ensure representation of new classes.
  - 2007: Wales-only reporting added; Wales gains more Welsh-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and total strata increased to 45; upland habitat sampling added as a separate module to improve country-level estimates.

- Sampling framework and data collection across surveys
  - Core design: stratified, random sampling of land classified units to ensure representative countryside sampling.
  - Sample unit: 1 km square, selected from a grid of classified squares; in earlier rounds, a center square plus surrounding squares were classified for robustness.
  - Field surveys progressed through successive decades with shifting focus:
    - 1978: Vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat mapping; 256 squares (8 per land class).
    - 1984: Land-use and habitat mapping; 384 squares (12 per class); eight previously visited squares retained.
    - 1990: All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; repeat quadrats and added land-cover data.
    - 2000 (CS2000): Expanded and rebalanced to support separate country estimates; introduced country-unit class subdivisions and additional sampling to represent new classes; upland habitat module added.
    - 2007 (CS2007): Welsh-specific refinements; additional Welsh samples to strengthen Wales-only reporting; five new Welsh sub-classes created; overall 45 strata.
  - Data products and documentation
    - Outputs include main survey reports, land-class maps, and tables detailing the number of squares per class and per country.
    - Notable emphasis on documenting the method for calculating national estimates from stratified samples and the implications of changing classifications over time.

- Country-specific reporting and data governance
  - Separate country estimates became a key requirement post-devolution (England with Wales, Scotland, Wales standalone).
  - The framework adapts classifications and sampling to support reliable country-level estimates, including sub-division and aggregation of land classes and adjusted sampling rates.
  - Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates; Wales gains additional Welsh-class variants to improve precision for Wales.

- Data consistency, versioning and governance implications
  - Changing land classifications affects the consistency of stock estimates across surveys; researchers prefer using the latest classification for within-survey consistency but may reference original classifications for cross-survey comparability.
  - 62% correspondence between the 1990 classification and the original, with non-matching squares typically falling into neighboring classes; this has implications for trend analyses and requires careful metadata.
  - Large-scale effort to maintain a coherent time-series despite re-classifications; detailed notes and tables accompany reports to aid data users and data managers.

- Practical data stewardship considerations
  - Metadata needs to capture: classification version (32, 40, 45 classes), country-unit designation, year of survey, sample square IDs, stratum definitions, and sampling rates.
  - Documentation of data lineage and methodological changes is essential to support reproducibility and correct interpretation of trends.
  - Data sharing and accessibility are facilitated through formal reports (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) with maps and appendices detailing sample distributions and class definitions.
  - Acknowledgements and extensive references indicate collaborative data stewardship across agencies and years.

- Endnotes and further reading
  - Includes a comprehensive bibliography and appendices detailing a brief history of the ITE Land Classification and detailed class descriptions, underscoring the long-term data governance context for Countryside Survey datasets.
