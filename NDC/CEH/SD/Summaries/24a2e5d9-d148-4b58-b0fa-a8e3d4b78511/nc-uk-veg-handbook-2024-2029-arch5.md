# UKCEH Countryside Survey: Field Handbook 2024-2029

## Overview
- Guidance for recording vegetation plots across the Countryside Survey to quantify long-term changes by habitat type and landscape location.
- Emphasizes data governance, standardized metadata, and reproducible methods to ensure datasets are discoverable and usable.
- Data are collected via digital tools (FieldMaps and Survey123) and stored in a central database; paper maps/photos remain alongside.

## Data Governance and Standards
- Define and capture consistent plot header data, plot-specific headers, and vegetation species data (including nested X-plot structure).
- Enforce metadata: plot location (GPS), slope, aspect, vegetation height categories, photos, and sketch maps for repeatability.
- Use of unique identifiers: Square, Plot Type, Plot Number, and auto-generated Plot ID for traceability.
- Clear handling of accessibility and disclosure risks (Not Found, Not Appropriate, Access Denied) to preserve dataset integrity.
- Avoid uprooting invasive species; document combinations (taxa amalgamations) when identification is uncertain.
- Bryophytes/Lichens limited to specified lists; emphasis on total bryophyte cover and key Sphagnum categories for efficiency.

## Data Collection and Workflow
- Three-page plot recording structure per plot: header (page 1), plot-specific headers (page 2), vegetation data (page 3).
- Emphasis on minimizing disturbance while conducting a full vegetation census across nested nest plots.
- Repeated plots require relocation evidence (maps, photos, GPS) and standardized decisions on “Found,” “Not Found,” or “Not Appropriate.”
- Data entry follows guided workflows in FieldMaps (plot navigation) and Survey123 (data forms); offline syncing recommended.
- Submitting data: online 'Send Now' when complete; offline support with Drafts/Outbox; ability to copy to a new survey for edits.
- Documentation of why plots are moved, lost, or inaccessible to maintain time-series integrity.

## Plot Types and Protocols
- X Plots (X1-X5): 200 m² plots with nested X nest sizes from Nest 0 to Nest 5; full species lists per nest with cumulative covers up to ~100% per nest; GPS point recorded at the X plot south corner; trees/shrubs and overhanging vegetation included in cover estimates.
  - Locating X plots uses random points and sector-based placement; avoid trampling in arable fields and adjust placement for crop/grass timing.
  - Plot layout uses diagonals with strings and poles; inner nests marked by color-coded strings.
- Linear Plots: B (Boundary), H (Hedgerow), S (Streamside), R (Roadside) plots; 10 m x 1 m strips positioned relative to the dominant feature.
  - B plots aligned to a boundary feature; H plots follow hedge centers with 1 m projection; S/R plots aligned to water edge or bank/edge typology.
  - Wales/Scotland: H plots record dominant species; England: dominant species only.
  - Include soil samples and header metadata; document distance from ploughed edge or water edge as applicable.
- Plot Accessibility: If a linear plot is not accessible, record as appropriate or move on; aim to reflect long-term change even if plotted differently.
- Plot Maps and Photos: Essential for relocation; photos should reference a stable nearby feature and include plot number/type; sketch maps accompany GPS data.

## Metadata and Documentation
- Plot header data (Square, Plot Type, Plot Number, Plot ID), recorder name, slope, aspect, shade, plot map status, and notes.
- Geopoint collection via GPS with guidance on accuracy, offline/offline syncing, and map-based location validation.
- Plot photos and sketch maps must be captured and linked to the correct plot ID; photos help relocation in subsequent surveys.
- Vegetation height is captured for canopy, shrub, and ground layers in defined categories.
- Species data entry: nested nesting for X plots; 5% cover intervals; total may exceed 100% due to layering; record overhanging species as present.

## Data Quality Assurance and Submissions
- Software prompts ensure mandatory fields are completed before submission.
- QA checks cover missing data, relocation decisions, and consistency across nests/plots.
- Submitting via Survey123/FieldMaps; offline drafts saved locally with options to resend or copy to new survey for edits.
- Recommended practices include documenting identifications and, if necessary, photographing unidentified species for later confirmation.

## Tools and Data Access
- FieldMaps: navigation, offline syncing, layering (e.g., Broad Habitat maps), and GPS/location capture; supports map-based plotting and layer visibility.
- Survey123: form-driven data collection with multiple pages, dropdowns, autocompletion (autotype), and photo attachments; supports offline use and data submission workflows.
- Appendices provide generic setup instructions and a random-number appendix used for plot allocation.
- Data and maps are available through SharePoint and central databases; paper maps provided where necessary.

## Challenges and Considerations for Data Stewards
- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities may affect study design and data usability.
- Timely access to data and cooperation from data creators to meet metadata and formatting standards.
- Interoperability across systems and formats; managing large, long-running time-series datasets.
- Handling outdated or legacy databases; ensuring ongoing compatibility with new field systems and templates.
- Balancing thorough species identification with practical field efforts (prioritizing vascular plants and total bryophyte data).

## Appendices and Resources
- Appendix 1: FieldMaps & Survey123 installation and generic notes; GPS, offline use, and data collection tips.
- Appendix 2: Random numbers between 0 and 1 used for plot allocation.
- Additional guidance on GPS accuracy, map usage, and survey management within FieldMaps and Survey123.
