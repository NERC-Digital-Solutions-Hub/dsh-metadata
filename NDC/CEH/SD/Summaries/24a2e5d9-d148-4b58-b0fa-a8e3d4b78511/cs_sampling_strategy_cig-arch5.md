# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Describes the sampling framework and land classification basis for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
- Emphasizes the long-standing link between the ITE Land Classification and the survey’s time-series data.
- Aims to provide representative, stratified samples that support national and country-level estimates of habitat and land-use features across Great Britain.

## Key concepts for data governance
- ITE Land Classification as the stratification backbone:
  - Stratified, random sampling to minimize bias and ensure representation across land types.
  - Original approach used 1 km squares; centre squares were classified, plus surrounding squares to assign class.
- Classification evolution and data lineage:
  - 32 original land classes (mid-1970s to 1978 framework).
  - Expanded to 40 classes (CS1990) and later to 45 classes (CS2000/CS2007) to enable country-specific reporting (Scotland, England, Wales) after devolution.
  - Revisions sometimes altered square classifications; cross-survey comparability requires careful documentation of classification version.
- National vs. country-level estimates:
  - Early surveys used GB-wide means per Land Class to estimate national habitat areas.
  - Later surveys introduced country-unit estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) with additional sampling and sub-divided classes to reflect country-specific reporting needs.
- Data documentation and reproducibility:
  - Tables and figures (e.g., class descriptions, sample counts per class, and country-specific maps) accompany the strategy to enable future re-use and audit of sampling decisions.
  - Clear guidance on which classification version to use for GB estimates vs. cross-survey consistency.

## Survey timeline and sampling framework

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - ISA-based classification produced 32 land classes from 1 km squares (centre squares of 15 x 15 km grid).
  - 8 squares per land class surveyed (total 256); national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square × land-class area.
  - Surrounding four squares also classified, total 6039 classified squares.

- 1984 – Second Field Survey
  - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - National estimates recalculated using 1978 Land Classification framework.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990) and Third Field Survey
  - Revised to classify every GB 1 km square; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Included repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats; linked to first land-cover map.
  - Classification changes caused shifts in class distributions; cross-year comparability noted.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification (CS1998) and Fourth Field Survey
  - Land Classification extended to enable separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
  - 569 squares surveyed; separate reporting for Scotland and inventory updates.

- 2000 – CS2000 Updates and Separate Country Estimates
  - Addressed policy-driven needs for England, Scotland, and Wales reporting.
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions (creating 40 strata, then 45 with aggregations).
  - Additional 19–43 new squares allocated to ensure representation of new country-specific classes; Isle of Man adjustments (replacing IOM squares with England squares).
  - Focus on improving accuracy for upland habitat estimates with dedicated sampling module.

- 2007 – CS2007 Adjustments for Wales-only Reporting and Upland Module
  - Wales reporting demands led to sub-division of several classes into Welsh equivalents (creating five new Wales-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Number of strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to guarantee representation (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class).
  - Some English classes reduced (4e and 15e) due to Welsh additions; overall sampling remained robust for Wales and acceptable precision for England.
  - Introduction of an uplands module with 30 additional squares to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
  - Comprehensive country-frame maps and updated class maps for England with Wales and Scotland.

## Data outputs and governance implications

- Dataset structure and comparability
  - The Land Classification version used determines national estimates; best practice: use the latest classification for GB estimates, but older classification may be used for cross-survey consistency.
  - Documentation of classification version, country-unit framing, and any reclassification of squares is essential for data users.
- Sampling density and representation
  - Early surveys prioritized uniform sampling per class (8–12 squares per class), later augmented to ensure Welsh and upland representation.
  - Wales received the most intensive sampling in CS2000/CS2007 to support Wales-only reporting.
  - Upland-focused sampling module added to improve precision in upland habitat estimates.
- Country-specific reporting
  - England with Wales and Scotland frameworks established; Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates.
  - Country-specific class subdivisions and adaptive sampling strategies ensure more accurate policy-relevant estimates per country.
- Documentation and references
  - Extensive acknowledgments and a robust list of further reading support traceability of methods and lineage of the Land Classification approach.

## Endnotes and references
- The document provides a detailed chronological narrative of the ITE Land Classification development, the CS survey years, class descriptions, and sampling maps.
- It includes guidance on data interpretation across years, with specific notes on cross-year comparability and the impact of changing classifications on national estimates.

## Practical takeaways for Data Stewards
- Maintain metadata on Land Classification version, country-unit framing, and sampling design per survey year.
- Preserve lineage by linking estimates to the specific classification and sampling scheme used.
- Ensure users understand when country-unit reporting was implemented and how Welsh upland and other country-specific modules affect comparability.
- Support data users with clear guidance on choosing classification versions for GB estimates versus cross-survey consistency.
- Archive and reference the appendix materials, tables, and figures that document class definitions, sample distributions, and country-specific sampling schemes.
