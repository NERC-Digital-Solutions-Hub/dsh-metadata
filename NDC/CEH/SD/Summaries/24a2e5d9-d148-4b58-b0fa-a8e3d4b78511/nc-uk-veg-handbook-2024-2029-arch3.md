# UKCEH Countryside Survey: Field Handbook 2024-2029

## Purpose and scope
- Establish environmental health measures by systematically recording vegetation plots to quantify countryside change and inform policy decisions.
- Build a long-running time series since 1978, with plots re-found or replaced as needed to maximise continuity and detect vegetation change by habitat and landscape location.

## Plot design and sampling framework
- Plot types
  - X plots: 200 m² (14.14 m × 14.14 m) with nested subplots from nest 0 to nest 5; ground flora recorded with increasing nest sizes; 1 m² to 14 m² nest sizes included; species lists and % cover per nest.
  - Linear plots: 10 m × 1 m plots located along field boundaries, hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides (B, H, S, R). Half of squares contain linear plots; originally established for long time-series since 1978.
- Plot placement and relocation
  - Randomly allocated X plots within each square; plots may be moved or replaced if necessary (e.g., access issues or land-use change).
  - For repeat recording, relocation uses GPS, plot maps, and photos; “Found” indicates location is close enough to previous, allowing snapshot comparability; “Not found” or “New plot” used when location cannot be reliably re-established.
  - If a plot cannot be relocated, or the land is no longer appropriate, mark as Not Appropriate and record reasons.
- Data collection intensity
  - X plots capture ground flora and associated vegetation layers across nested sizes; include dominant bryophytes but avoid exhaustive bryophyte detail (with designated moss lists where applicable).
  - Linear plots capture species presence and cover within the 1 m wide strip along the specified feature; photos and sketches accompany records.

## Data collection workflow and tools
- Digital data capture
  - ESRI FieldMaps for plot navigation and map layers; Survey123 for data entry (header, plot-specific header, and vegetation data).
  - Offline syncing recommended; updates and forms accessed via My Surveys in Survey123.
- Data capture components
  - Plot header (page 1): square, plot type, plot number, Plot ID, recorder, location details, slope, aspect, photos, notes.
  - Plot positioning: geopoint auto-captured or manually refined; relocation status (Found, Not Found, New Plot, etc.); accuracy and home location features.
  - Plot-specific header (page 2): type-dependent fields (e.g., X plots include soil sampling data and related barcode scanning).
  - Entering species (page 3): nested Nest 0–Nest 5 data for X plots; species lists with autocompletion; 5% cover intervals; allowance for “Other” entries and unidentified taxa with photo or note options.
  - Bryophytes and lichens: restricted mosses and listed bryophytes; emphasis on total bryophyte and Sphagnum categories rather than exhaustive identifications.
- Plot photos and sketch maps
  - Minimum two to three photos per plot focusing on identifiable nearby features to aid re-finding; photos require plot number/type and direction indicators.
  - Sketch maps must be clear and precise, with GPS reference points marked; when maps are edited or redrawn, record edits with initials and date; photos accompany revised maps.

## Data submission, quality, and governance
- Submission and editing
  - Online submission possible via Send Now; offline mode supports drafts and outbox; resubmission uses copied surveys and notes to indicate corrected versions.
  - Automatic autosave during data entry; validation prompts ensure required fields are completed before submission.
- Data quality and consistency
  - Nested X-plot methodology requires careful tracking of nest boundaries, cover estimates, and presence/absence data; caution against blank or duplicate entries.
  - Standardized 5% cover intervals; hierarchical nest structure ensures cumulative recording from interior to outer plots.
- Data management and sharing
  - Underlying plot data, photos, and GIS-derived plot locations are intended for open sharing with appropriate governance; data are documented in a consistent field handbook to enable replication and policy-relevant analysis.
  - Metadata and provenance are maintained through plot IDs, map layers, and documented relocation decisions.

## Time-series integrity and monitoring relevance
- Long-term consistency
  - Repeated plots and careful relocation strategies maximise the durability of the time series across decades.
  - Documentation of plot changes, access refusals, and new land-use conditions preserves interpretability of trend analyses.
- Handling disruption and change
  - Provisions for not found plots, new plots, and areas with access constraints ensure the dataset still reflects geographic and habitat breadth across the 1 km squares.
  - Linear plots (first recorded since 1978) provide a backbone for long-term change in hedgerows, boundaries, streams, and roadside habitats.

## Particular considerations for the monitoring framework
- Data access and silo risk
  - Centralization of FieldMaps and Survey123 data with standardized metadata reduces silos and improves data discoverability.
- Metadata completeness
  - Comprehensive header information, plot positioning data, and sketch/photo records are essential for re-finding plots and validating changes over time.
- Complex data transformation
  - Nested nests in X plots require careful data handling to ensure accurate aggregation and interpretation of cover across scales.
- Communication of findings
  - Output formats (reports, charts, dashboards) should translate complex vegetative changes into policy-relevant indicators by habitat type and landscape location.
