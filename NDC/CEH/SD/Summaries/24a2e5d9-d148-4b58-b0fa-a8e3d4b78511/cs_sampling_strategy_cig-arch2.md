# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Outlines the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification to provide a consistent, stratified approach for monitoring environmental features and change over time.
  - Aims to support national estimates of habitat and land characteristics and to enable country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and upland habitat analysis.

- Core concept: ITE Land Classification
  - Stratified, random sampling system that divides Great Britain into discrete land classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate).
  - Early approach used a centre square from a 15 x 15 km grid to classify 1 km squares, creating a set of land classes to ensure representative sampling.
  - National estimates are derived by combining area-weighted class totals with class-specific habitat measurements.

- How the sampling framework was developed and used
  - 1978 (CS1978)
    - Establishment of the original ITE Land Classification with 32 classes.
    - Sampling: eight 1 km squares per class (total 256 squares) chosen randomly from the classified set.
    - Output focused on vegetation, soils, and habitat areas.
  - 1984 (CS1984)
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
    - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (CS1990)
    - Transition to an “All Squares” Land Classification, incorporating data from all GB 1 km squares.
    - Surveyed 508 squares; repeated many features from CS1984; Land Classification refined but results aligned with 1990 framework for national estimates.
  - 1998/CS1990 revisions
    - Land Classification updated to support separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Recognized need for separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland) and better upland representation.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-specific versions, increasing strata to 40.
    - Added 19 extra squares to improve representation across new classes; additional tweaks to maintain comparable sampling rates between England and Wales.
    - Wales-specific adjustments led to a Wales-focused sampling emphasis and revised country maps for England-with-Wales and Scotland.
    -(Upland module) A 30-square upland focuses were added to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Responded to Wales-only reporting needs following devolution; expanded Wales sampling and refined country-specific estimates.
    - Sub-divided Land Classes into England-with-Wales country units, creating five new country-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increasing total strata to 45.
    - Implemented 43 additional Welsh squares; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained with only four squares each due to balance with precision considerations.
    - England, Wales, and Scotland maps revised to reflect the new country-unit classifications and sampling framework.

- Outputs, maps, and datasets
  - Land Classification maps at each revision (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) showing how GB was stratified and sampled.
  - Tables and figures documenting sample squares and sampling rates by survey year (e.g., totals per class, number of squares per country, and year-by-year changes).
  - Reference figures (maps) illustrating sample squares and the revised Land Class frameworks for England with Wales and Scotland.
  - Notes on consistency and comparability of national estimates across surveys when Land Classification changes.

- National estimates and data consistency
  - National habitat and land estimates are derived by combining class-level statistics (mean habitat area per square) with class-area proportions.
  - Changes in the Land Classification affect GB-wide estimates; the 2006 scoping guidance recommends using the latest country-specific classifications for internal consistency, while noting cross-survey comparability considerations.
  - Table and note discussions provide guidance on how to interpret and compare results across CS surveys, including the implications of adopting original versus revised classifications.

- Country-specific reporting and uplands
  - Wales reporting required dedicated Welsh samples; England and Wales sampling adjusted to ensure adequate representation of Welsh classes.
  - Separate country unit stratification (England-with-Wales and Scotland) and subsequent sub-division of Land Classes to reflect country-specific contexts.
  - Additional upland module introduced to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- Data governance and accessibility considerations
  - The strategy emphasizes standardized data collection, classification, and representation across surveys to enable clear, policy-relevant outputs (maps, tables, and national estimates).
  - While the document focuses on methodology and stratification, the approach aligns with cultivating reusable datasets and improving the potential for broader data integration and access to underlying data used for outputs and policy analysis.
