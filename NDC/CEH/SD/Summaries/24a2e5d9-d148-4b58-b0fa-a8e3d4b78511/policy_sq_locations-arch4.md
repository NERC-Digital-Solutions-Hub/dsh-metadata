# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Programme and Partners
- 2024-2029 rolling programme funded by NERC via UKCEH National Capability for UK Challenges Programme NE/Y006208/1.
- 2007 CS partners include: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Confidentiality Rationale
- Locations kept confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality supports future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission from landowners.
- Public interest rationale; disclosures handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release and Precision
- Location data can be released to show whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to indicate the 10×10 km grid square.
- Six-digit precise locations are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external requests must show that pre-processing by UKCEH is not feasible and that the data to be used carries equal/higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within survey squares could indirectly identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

## Licence Conditions
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the project.
- End of licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derivatives should be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases, and must not be used to derive precise locations or claim such capability.

## Responsibilities and Governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with contractual clauses.
- Licence approvals denied will follow Act and Regulations procedures; UKCEH provides annual reporting on applications and decisions.
- UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing analysis support for CS partners; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to use data; collaboration or payment terms may be negotiated.
