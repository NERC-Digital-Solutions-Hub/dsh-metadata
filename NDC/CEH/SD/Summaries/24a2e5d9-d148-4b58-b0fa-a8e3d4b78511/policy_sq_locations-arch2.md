# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of survey sites.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- 2024-2029 program funded by NERC via UKCEH (NE/Y006208/1).
- CS partners include NERC (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, and Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Both are essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission.
- Requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## Data scope and accessibility
- The policy covers CS square locations and spatial data within survey squares.
- Other CS data remains publicly accessible.

## When and how location data can be released
- Release allowed for identifying whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing each square.
- Six-digit grid references may be released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; requires UKCEH pre-processing of analysis and demonstration that competing IP/data confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data from within squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Conditions of release and licensing
- Licensees must:
  - Preserve confidentiality; store data securely; restrict access to authorized individuals.
  - Access for finite project periods; data not retained for other responsibilities.
  - Destroy data and provide written confirmation at the end of the licensing period.
  - Not release data or information that could compromise square confidentiality or identify landowners.
  - Not use data to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - Provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP) if requested.
- Four-digit releases have similar licensing terms but do not require the same IP confidentiality as six-digit releases; users must not attempt to derive precise locations or claim to do so.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences.
- Licences must be signed by an authorised senior person from the licensee.
- If approval is denied, decisions follow the Act and Regulations.
- UKCEH provides an annual report detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- UKCEH aims to offer reasonable pre-processing support for CS partnership uses; others on a case-by-case basis.
- Partners are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to uses covered by this policy; collaboration or payment terms are negotiated case-by-case.
