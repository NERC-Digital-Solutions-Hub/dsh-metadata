# UKCEH Countryside Survey: Field Handbook 2024-2029

- Purpose: Provide standardized methods for recording vegetation plots across the countryside to quantify changes over time, enabling repeatable, location-based data for habitat and landscape analyses.
- Scope: Detailed protocols for plot location, recording (header, vegetation, and species data), plot types (X plots and linear plots), data capture via FieldMaps and Survey123, photo and sketch-map requirements, and data submission and quality considerations.

## Key concepts and aims for data support

- Ensure data are findable and comparable across survey waves by combining GPS, sketch maps, and plot photographs to aid relocation.
- Create self-serve data products (e.g., species lists, cover estimates, and plot-level summaries) for end users, while maintaining high data quality and traceability.
- Promote consistent data entry, aggregation, and handling of difficult taxa (e.g., certain bryophytes) to support longitudinal analyses.
- Manage data through offline-capable digital workflows (FieldMaps and Survey123) with robust appendices and guidance for data submission, revisions, and QA.

## Plot types and sampling design

- X plots (200 m2; 14.14 x 14.14 m) with nested nests:
  - Nest 0 (innermost 1x1 m area) to Nest 5 (outermost nest) used to progressively record vascular plants.
  - Nested species lists and 5% cover increments; total cover can exceed 100% due to layering.
  - Location: randomised within squares; GPS at nest corners; photos and sketch maps aid relocation.
  - Refinding and relocation: use plot maps, photos, and GPS; if unreliably located, mark as Not Found and record a replacement or new feature.
- Linear plots (R, B, H, S):
  - R: Roadside plots (10 x 1 m) along roadsides/verges; B: Boundary plots along field boundaries; H: Hedgerow plots; S: Streamside plots.
  - Only half of the 1 km squares (those first surveyed in 1978) include linear plots to preserve long-term time series.
  - Layout rules depend on dominant vertical feature and edge distance; include 1 m wide strip from the feature for data collection.
  - Wales/Scotland require full H plot species recording; England may record only dominant species with a soil sample.

## Plot relocation and markers

- Plot markers: aluminum plates or wooden stakes; may be buried or displaced; metal detectors provided.
- If plate not found within 5–10 minutes (field conditions permitting), relocate using sketch map and photographs; mark as Found or Not Found accordingly.
- Special relocation rules:
  - If habitat or access changes, reassess whether a plot is Still Found, Not Found, or Not Appropriate.
  - If a previous area becomes accessible/unavailable, prioritize repeating prior plots; add new plots only if time allows.
  - For X plots, location is often projected from the previous X plot position; if crossing a linear feature, relocate to vegetated land at least 12 m from the edge.

## Data capture workflow and tools

- FieldMaps: Used to navigate to plots and access plot data forms; offline syncing recommended.
- Survey123: Entry form for plot data (header, plot-specific header, and vegetation data). Forms are started from My Surveys or via a plot link.
- Data entry flow:
  - New plots: open Survey123 via My Surveys Collect, complete Page 1 (header), Page 2 (plot-type-specific headers), Page 3 (vegetation data).
  - Existing plots: open and edit as appropriate; avoid editing old plots that are being re-recorded unless following protocol.
- Plot header information (Page 1) includes:
  - Square, Plot Type (X, B, R, H, S), Plot Number, Plot ID (auto-generated), surveyor name/initials, plot positioning, and plot status (Found, Not Found, New Plot, etc.).
  - Geopoint capture (GPS) with offline accuracy considerations; decision-making on whether the location is close enough to previous surveys.
  - Plot maps (paper or digital) with notes on disturbance or lost plots.
- Plot positioning and relocation notes:
  - Location accuracy and map overlays to aid precise relocation; average GPS location and accuracy thresholds may be used.
  - “Found” implies acceptable relocation error; “Not Found” or “New Plot” indicates major relocation or new land area.
- Plot recording specifics (Page 3):
  - X plots: presence/absence and cover of species across nested 0–5 nests; notes on overhanging vegetation and unidentified species.
  - Linear plots: species presence and cover across the 10 x 1 m transect, with relevant header information (soil sampling, photos, etc.).
  - Major bryophytes: listed protocol with emphasis on bryophyte and lichen handling, especially mosses; note that certain taxa are combined to reflect identification practicality.
- Photos and plot sketch maps:
  - Two to three photos per plot to aid relocation and illustrate change; photos must identify plot number/type and reference nearby landmarks.
  - Sketch maps must be clear and measured; include GPS reference point and north arrow; update or redraw maps if landscape has changed.

## Data entry specifics by section

- Page 2: Plot header information by plot type (e.g., X plots include soil sampling status, date, and barcode scanning for soil bags).
- Page 3: Species data entry
  - Nested nests for X plots with species lists and 5% cover intervals.
  - Ensure overhanging species (trees, shrubs, ferns) are counted as present and recorded for the plot.
  - Use “Other” with free text for unidentified species with the option to attach a photo for later identification.
- 2.4 Completing and submitting data
  - Online submission via Send Now if the survey is complete and online; offline data can be saved as Drafts or Outbox and submitted later.
  - Resubmission: use Copy to new survey when resubmitting to preserve edits; auto-save helps mitigate data loss from device crashes.

## Plot types in detail

- 3.1 X Plots (X1–X5):
  - Located at predetermined random points; if new, locate as close as possible to marked random points.
  - 200 m2 plot layout with nested nests; Nest 0 is the innermost 1 m2, progressing to Nest 5.
  - 200 m2 design uses diagonals and plumbed markers; Nest 0 around a center point; Nest 1 starts at 2 x 2 m, etc.
  - Species recording begins at Nest 0 and accumulates as nests expand; if no additional species are found in a nest, the corresponding box can be ticked.
- 4 Linear Plots (B, H, S, R):
  - B: 10 x 1 m boundary plots; H: hedgerows; S: streamside; R: roadside.
  - Positioning uses 1 m strips from the feature; when multiple features exist, align with the dominant feature.
  - Hook up with soil sampling and other header data; photos and sketch maps to aid relocation.
  - Specific guidance on placement relative to water edges, banks, and road interfaces; avoid MHW in coastal contexts.

## Data quality, taxonomy, and lists

- Taxonomy and aggregations:
  - Record to species level where possible; use amalgamated taxa for difficult separations to maintain consistency with historical data.
  - Do not uproot invasive species; use photos for verification where needed.
  - Bryophytes and lichens: record only listed mosses and bryophytes/lichens as per the Vegplots guidelines; complete bryophyte lists may be aggregated for analysis.
- Mosses (Sphagna and moss list):
  - Categories for Sphagnum green/fat, green/thin, red/fat, red/thin; identification should be prioritized for total bryophyte cover, not necessarily for all moss species.
  - The moss list provides an extensive set of species for reference, but ultimate priority is comprehensive total bryophyte cover.

## Appendices and tools

- Appendix 1: FieldMaps & Survey123
  - Guidance on installing and using FieldMaps and Survey123, including map navigation, offline syncing, GPS accuracy, and data collection workflows.
  - Explanation of Map Gallery, basemaps, and GPS troubleshooting (e.g., time synchronization issues, My Location and accuracy indicators).
- Appendix 2: Random numbers
  - Random numbers between 0 and 1 for sampling design or allocation, provided as example sequences.

## Practical considerations and end notes

- Accessibility and land-use changes may affect plot availability; if a plot cannot be recorded, document reasons and decisions in notes.
- Time spent “understanding the ask” and data preparation is acknowledged as a challenge; the handbook provides explicit guidance to streamline data collection and improve reuse of outputs.
- The handbook emphasizes documentation to support re-finding plots across surveys and to ensure the long-term integrity of the dataset for policy and ecological monitoring.
