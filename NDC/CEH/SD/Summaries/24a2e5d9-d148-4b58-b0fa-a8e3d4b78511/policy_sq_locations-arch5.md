# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and site anonymity.
- All other CS data are publicly accessible.
- 2024-2029 rolling program funded by NERC via UKCEH; partners include Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH, etc.

## Confidentiality & Data Scope
- CS square locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys and policy-relevant science.
- Confidentiality supports the survey’s integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permissions.
- Requests for information are handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access Levels & Release Conditions
- Allowed to determine if squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) can be released under licence to identify the relevant grid square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing analysis by UKCEH; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may location data be released externally under licence.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional-access terms as precise location data.
- Four-digit releases have lower IP/confidentiality thresholds than six-digit releases.

## Licensing Terms & Use Restrictions
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and be accessible only to named individuals with legitimate project need.
- Licences granted for finite periods and for specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
- Upon licence expiry, organisations must certify destruction of location data.
- No third-party release that could compromise confidentiality; no use to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Licences for four-digit data prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Roles, Responsibilities & Governance
- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licences require sign-off by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH follows statutory procedures under the Act/Regulations.
- UKCEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision rationales.
- UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partner organisations are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to data use covered by this policy; collaboration or paid support may be arranged as appropriate.

## Compliance & Practical Guidance for Data Stewards
- Implement governance controls to manage confidential spatial data, licensing, and access permissions.
- Maintain clear metadata on data sensitivity, licensing terms, and permissible uses.
- Coordinate with UKCEH for pre-processing analyses to avoid unnecessary release of precise locations.
- Ensure licensing workflows include secure storage, access controls, and destruction attestations at licence end.
- Communicate constraints to data users, including prohibitions on visits planning and landowner surveillance.
- Track and report on access requests, decisions, and grounds for approvals/denials.

## Practical Takeaways for Data Stewards
- Treat CS location data as highly sensitive with strict access and retention controls.
- Use licensing to balance public-interest data utility with safeguards for future surveys and landowner relationships.
- Leverage UKCEH as the primary gateway for potential releases and pre-processing; align internal processes accordingly.
- Prepare for case-by-case decision-making and potential collaboration or payment arrangements when involving external organisations.
