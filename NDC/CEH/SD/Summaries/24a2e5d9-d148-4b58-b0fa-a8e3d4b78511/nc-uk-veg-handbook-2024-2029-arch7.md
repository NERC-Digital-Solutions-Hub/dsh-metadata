UKCEH Countryside Survey: Field Handbook 2024-2029

## Overview
- Purpose: long-term, map-based vegetation data across survey squares to quantify countryside changes with high spatial precision.
- Data products: GIS-ready plot data (X plots and linear plots) with GPS, photos, sketch maps, and species composition.
- Delivery: digital data collected via FieldMaps and Survey123; paper plots/maps available as backups.
- Emphasis: early prototyping, user feedback, QA, and consistent data standards across datasets and years.

## GIS workflow, tools, and data management
- FieldTools:
  - FieldMaps for plot navigation and mapping layers; Survey123 for data entry.
  - Offline syncing recommended; GPS geopoints captured automatically when available.
- Data entry flow:
  - New plots: access surveys via Survey123, begin with plot header (page 1), then plot headers (page 2), then vegetation data (page 3).
  - Repeats: log as Found, Not Found, New Plot replacement, or Not Appropriate; include relocation notes and map/photos.
- Location and basemaps:
  - Use multiple basemaps (e.g., 2007 Broad Habitat) and grids; adjust visibility via layers.
  - Location averaging and fullscreen map options improve placement accuracy; GPS accuracy indicated in-app.
- Data submission:
  - Online: Send Now; offline: Save Drafts/Outbox and send later; resubmissions create new survey copies with notes indicating correct version.
- Documentation and support:
  - Appendix and FieldMaps Survey123 guidance provided; random numbers appendix supplied for sampling design.

## Plot types and data captured
- X plots (200 m²; nested 14.14 m square with nests 0–5)
  - Purpose: ground flora presence/absence with % cover in nested quadrats; coverage can exceed 100% due to layering.
  - Nest 0 to Nest 5: sequentially record species and covers; nest 0 for inner 1 m² and nests expand outward.
  - Location: GPS reading taken at the south corner; nest-based species lists generated cumulatively.
  - Special notes: detailed nest protocols and photos to aid re-finding; unknown species handled via Other or photo for later ID.
- Linear plots (R, B, H, S)
  - Each plot is 10 m × 1 m; positioned relative to a distinctive feature (roadside, boundary, hedgerow, streamside).
  - Placement rules: distance from feature, orientation, and edge alignment (e.g., for hedgerows, long axis along hedge center; for boundaries, edge at water or bank as appropriate).
  - Data recorded: header info, distance from edge (for B plots), stream/road/water metadata, and species cover.
  - Wales/Scotland: H plots record dominant species; England: dominant species only for H plots.
- Plot headers and positioning
  - Header includes site, recorders, slope, aspect, location, photos; plot type and number are assigned (ID automatically formed from square, type, and number).
  - Geopoint details: offline GPS available; photo and sketch map are essential relocation aids.

## Plot relocation, positioning, and re-finding
- Plot markers
  - Original plots marked with aluminium plates or stakes; metal detectors used to locate markers.
  - If marker not found within a reasonable time, rely on sketch maps and photos; mark as Not Found if location uncertain.
- Relocation rules (2.3.1)
  - Assess land access, habitat type, and broader habitat classifications (Broad Habitat, Priority Habitat).
  - Distinguish between locating within the original position vs broader polygon; record the most accurate habitat assignment.
  - If land use changed (e.g., new housing), mark as Not Appropriate and provide disturbance notes.
- Refinding guidance
  - If prior location cannot be satisfactorily refound, record Not Found and create a New Plot in available area.
  - When possible, prioritize repeating original plots to maximize the time-series length.
  - For X plots, avoid crossing crops and respect five-sector overlay to determine feasible new locations.
- X plot layout considerations
  - 200 m² X plots use diagonals and quadrats; nest 0 at one corner with precise distances to define nested areas.
  - Ensure new X plots avoid recent infrastructure or unviable land; if no viable land exists, do not record a Vegplots entry.

## Species recording, quality assurance, and data standards
- Taxonomic approach
  - Record to species level when possible, using amalgamated taxa only when necessary (consistent with prior surveys).
  - Do not uproot invasive species; if identification is uncertain, photograph for later determination.
- Bryophytes and lichens
  - Record only listed mosses and bryophytes/lichens per Vegplots protocol; aggregate categories are accepted when detailed ID is impractical.
  - Moss lists and Sphagnum categories provided; full bryophyte lists are not required where uncertain.
- X plots – species and nest structure
  - Nest 0 to Nest 5: record all species encountered by expanding nests; for Nest 1 and subsequent nests, only add species not present in earlier nests.
  - Covers are entered in 5% increments; total cover may exceed 100% due to layering; include overhanging vegetation in counts.
- Completeness and QA
  - Software prompts for missing fields before submission; ensure all necessary fields are completed.
  - If species are unidentified, use Other and capture photos; check for duplicates or blanks to ensure data quality.

## Data handling, sharing, and documentation
- Data submission and access
  - Centralized database submission for online surveys; offline data stored as Drafts/Outbox and submitted when online.
  - Submissions can be resent with notes indicating corrected versions; Sent forms are archived with a copy.
- Appendices and tooling
  - Appendix 1: FieldMaps & Survey123 generic notes (installation, workflow, GPS usage, map interactions).
  - Appendix 2: Random numbers between 0 and 1 for sampling sectors and plot allocation.
- Practical guidance
  - Plot maps may be paper or digital; keep accurate sketch maps with GPS points and reference features.
  - Photos should include plot number/type and reference features to aid re-finding in future surveys.
