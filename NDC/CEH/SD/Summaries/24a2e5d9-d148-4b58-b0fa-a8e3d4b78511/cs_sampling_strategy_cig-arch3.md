# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
- Builds on the ITE Land Classification developed over 30 years to stratify GB into homogeneous ecological units.
- Aims to produce robust national and country-specific estimates of habitat features to inform policy and monitor environmental change.

## Core concepts and approach
- Stratified, random sampling within predefined land classes to avoid bias and ensure representativeness.
- 1 km squares as the basic sampling unit, with surrounding squares allocated to each classified centre to capture local variability.
- Land Classification provides the stratification framework; national estimates are derived by combining mean characteristics per class with each class’s area.
- Evolution of the classification reflects growing policy and regional needs (Scotland, Wales, uplands).

## Development timeline of the ITE Land Classification and CS sampling
- 1978 CS: First large-scale application using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to define 32 land classes from 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid). Sampled eight squares per class (256 total).
- 1984 CS: Increased sample size to 12 squares per class (384 total) to better capture land-use and habitat mapping.
- 1990 CS: Land Classification expanded to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed. First linkage with the first Land Cover Map of GB from satellite imagery. Some squares reclassified; national estimates based on the 1990 scheme.
- 1998 CS: Land Classification revised to improve regional reporting (now 40 classes) and enable Scotland-only reporting; 569 squares surveyed overall in CS2000.
- 2000 CS: Introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland). Sub-division of classes to create country-unit versions, class aggregation where necessary, additional squares to ensure representation of new classes, and an upland module for England and Wales.
- 2007 CS: Further Wales-specific adjustments to support Wales-only reporting post-devolution. Created country-unit sub-classes (including 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); increased Wales sampling to achieve minimum representation; some English classes reduced to four squares per class; overall expansion to 45 strata, with updated maps for England, Wales, and Scotland.

## Survey design and allocation across major CS iterations
- CS1978: 256 squares across 32 classes; eight samples per class.
- CS1984: 384 squares; 12 per class; continuation of stratified sampling framework.
- CS1990: 508 squares; all GB squares included in a revised Land Classification; added satellite-linked land cover context.
- CS2000: 569 squares (England & Wales total: 311; Scotland and other adjustments); introduction of separate country estimates and new country-unit classifications; upland habitat module added (30 squares in uplands of England & Wales).
- CS2007: 591 squares overall; Wales Upland and Wales-country-unit refinements; additional Welsh squares to ensure Welsh-class representation; five new country-unit subclasses; England classes slightly reduced in some cases to maintain balance.

## Country-focused adaptations and upland emphasis
- England & Wales vs. Scotland reporting: frameworks adjusted to enable country-specific estimates, reflecting devolved governance and policy needs.
- Wales-specific enhancements: targeted expansion of Welsh samples (minimum 6 squares per new Welsh class) and subdivision of certain land classes to reflect England-Wales differences.
- Upland-focused module (CS2000): added 30 squares in upland areas of England and Wales to improve precision for upland habitat estimates.

## Tables, maps and data governance notes
- Maps and class maps updated to reflect revised classifications for England with Wales and Scotland (CS2000) and again for CS2007.
- Acknowledges consistency considerations: changing land classifications affects cross-survey comparability; within-survey estimates favor the latest classification, while cross-survey comparability may favor the older scheme.
- The strategy emphasizes documentation of sampling frames, class definitions, and allocation rules to support transparent national and country-level estimates.

## Implications for monitoring, reporting, and policy
- Provides a structured, evolving monitoring framework capable of delivering robust habitat and land-use estimates aligned with policy needs at GB and country levels.
- Supports Wales-only, Scotland-only, and England & Wales reporting, enabling tailored environmental policy and management decisions.
- Highlights the trade-offs between class granularity, sample size, and precision, particularly when introducing country-specific subdivisions or upland-focused modules.
- Underlines the importance of maintaining representative sampling through stratification, augmenting samples for underrepresented classes, and adjusting for devolution-driven reporting requirements.

## Endnotes and lineage
- The Sampling Strategy situates CS within a long history of land classification work (ITE Land Classification) and situates CS outputs within evolving policy contexts and data-availability constraints.
- Documentation and references provided (CS1978–CS2007 trajectory) support ongoing monitoring framework development and methodological transparency.
