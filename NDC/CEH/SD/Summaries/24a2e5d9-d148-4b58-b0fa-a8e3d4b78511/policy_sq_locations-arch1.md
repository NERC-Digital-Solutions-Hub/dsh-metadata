# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview and aims
- Maximises public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data remain publicly accessible.
- 2024-2029 program funded by NERC via UKCEH (NE/Y006208/1).

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations kept confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permissions; safeguards the survey’s ability to inform policy.

## Release: when and how location data can be shared
- Four-digit grid references (approximate locations) may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require UKCEH processing to avoid direct release, and may be disclosed only in very exceptional circumstances.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) carry similar confidentiality and require exceptional terms if released.
- Any data release must not enable locating exact squares or be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.

## Licensing terms and restrictions
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and be accessed only by named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are time-limited to specific projects; data must be destroyed at licence end.
- No data may be shared with third parties that could compromise confidentiality; no use to identify individual landowners or to organize visits.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have lower IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; spatial data releases follow the same principle.
- License terms include a clause preventing attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative from the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, decisions follow relevant Act and Regulations.
- UKCEH provides an annual report summarising applications and decisions.
- For internal CS-partner use, pre-processing analysis by UKCEH is encouraged and supported within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Prospective data users are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; support may be collaborative or paid depending on arrangements.

## Partners and context
- 2007 CS partners include NERC (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.
- The policy reflects ongoing collaboration and governance under the CS program.
