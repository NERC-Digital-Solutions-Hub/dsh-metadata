# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Establishes confidentiality for survey square locations and spatial data within squares.
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner goodwill.
- Applies only to survey square locations and within-square spatial data; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Data scope
- Covers: survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features).
- Excludes: all CS data not related to square locations (publicly accessible).

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Protects sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Preserves scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and future access/permissions.
- Confidentiality deemed in the public interest.

## Circumstances for release and precision levels
- Approximate access: four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km square a CS square falls into.
- More precise access: six-digit grid references require pre-processing by UKCEH if possible; only in very exceptional cases may external release occur under licence.
- Spatial data within squares could enable locating a square; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- When licensing four-digit releases, an IP/confidentiality justification is still required, but lower protection criteria apply than for six-digit releases.

## Licence conditions for release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and limit access to authorized personnel.
- Licences are finite in duration and project-specific; data must not be retained for broader organizational use.
- At licence end, evidence of data destruction or secure handling must be provided in writing.
- No release of data or derived information to third parties that could reveal square locations.
- Location data must not be used to schedule visits to CS squares or to monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but with lower IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases, and must not enable deriving exact square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions.
- UKCEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
- Decisions follow FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations; denial may be appealed under statutory procedures.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report on access applications and decision grounds.
- UKCEH may provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; assistance for other organisations is case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult UKCEH before using any data covered by this policy; collaboration or paid support may be negotiated case-by-case.

## Implications for GIS practice
- Access to precise location data is restricted and license-controlled.
- When designing analyses, prefer using four-digit references or non-location-derived outputs where possible.
- For six-digit or spatial data, anticipate exceptional approval processes and timeframes.
- Ensure data handling, storage, and destruction align with licence terms and JCOP-equivalent standards.
- Coordinate with UKCEH early to understand requirements and feasibility of processing or usage.

## Practical guidance for users
- Assess whether approximate (four-digit) location data suffices for your objectives.
- If precise locations or within-square maps are essential, initiate discussions with UKCEH/NERC early and prepare justification of confidentiality controls and IP protections.
- Plan for finite licence periods and confirm data destruction or secure retention post-project.
- Prepare to provide evidence of project governance and data management standards if required.
