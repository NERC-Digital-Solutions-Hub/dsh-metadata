# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
  - Policy specifically covers survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - 2024-2029 rolling program funded by NERC via UKCEH (National Capability for UK Challenges Programme).

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Preserve scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ability to secure future landowner access.
  - Public interest rationale; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

- Release conditions and precision levels
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
  - Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must be licensed externally; applicant must show IP data requires equal/higher confidentiality than CS data; UKCEH may preprocess to avoid release.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
  - Any release must avoid enabling precise square identification or visits; data usage restrictions apply.

- License terms and restrictions
  - Licence holders must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite (for specific projects); data must not be retained beyond the licensing period.
  - End-of-period: written destruction confirmation required.
  - No third-party release that could compromise confidentiality; no use to check landowner compliance or plan visits.
  - If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality of six-digit releases.
  - Clauses prevent attempts to deduce precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and process
  - UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) makes exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - Licences must be signed by authorized senior representatives of the licensee.
  - If approval is denied, procedures under FOI/Regulations are followed.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report summarising applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - There is a practical expectation that UKCEH can perform necessary pre-processing analysis within reasonable timeframes; support offered within CS partnership; other organisations treated case-by-case.
  - Prior consultation with UKCEH is highly recommended to define requirements and appropriate data use; involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

- Practical implications for data support
  - Assess and coordinate access requests, ensuring compliance with confidentiality and licence terms.
  - Determine appropriate release level (four-digit vs six-digit) and coordinate with UKCEH for preprocessing as needed.
  - Manage licence administration and documentation, including end-of-period destruction proof and annual reporting obligations.

- Context on data accessibility
  - All other CS data remains publicly accessible.
