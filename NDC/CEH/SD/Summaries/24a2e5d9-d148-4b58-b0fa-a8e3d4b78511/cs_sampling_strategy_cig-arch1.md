# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- The field-survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) 2007 is the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification, designed to produce representative, stratified samples of Britain's countryside to support national, regional, and country-specific environmental estimates.
- The approach links stratification (land classes) with a systematic sampling design to detect change over time and inform policy and planning.

## Core concepts

- ITE Land Classification
  - A stratification system that groups land based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to ensure samples cover the range of ecological variation.
  - Originated in the 1970s; initial classification used for GB-wide ecological surveys.

- Stratified, randomized sampling
  - Aims to minimize bias by dividing the landscape into discrete strata (land classes) and sampling within each stratum.
  - Initially used a center square plus surrounding squares to assign class, then selected multiple squares per class.

- Sample units and field survey
  - Field sampling primarily uses 1 km squares, sampled in a way that representative environmental features within each class are captured.
  - Early surveys combined classification with quadrat-based vegetation/soil data and habitat mapping to estimate national features.

## Timeline of developments

- CS1978 (Initial Land Classification)
  - 32 ITE Land Classes derived from environmental attributes.
  - 1 km squares used; eight samples per class (total 256 squares) were surveyed nationally.

- CS1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Emphasis shifted toward land use and habitat mapping; national estimates still based on the original classification.

- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification)
  - Land Classification revised to cover all GB squares; 508 squares were surveyed.
  - Repeated measurements of vegetation quadrats; a land-cover map was linked to the program.
  - Major change: expansion from a gridded, partial classification to attempting to classify every square, using surrogates due to computing limits.

- CS2000 (Developments of the Land Classification)
  - Addressed policy needs to produce separate England & Wales and Scotland estimates.
  - The Land Classification expanded and subdivided into country-unit versions, creating 40 strata.
  - Additional squares added to ensure representation of newer classes; 19 extra squares to guarantee first representation in each class, plus adjustments to maintain comparable sampling between England and Wales.
  - Uplands module added: 30 squares in upland/marginal upland classes to improve upland habitat estimates.

- CS2007 (Developments for Wales-only Reporting)
  - Wales reporting required, leading to further class subdivisions (5 new Wales-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Total strata increased to 45.
  - Wales received additional 43 squares; England adjustments ensured balanced representation; Isle of Man samples removed and replaced by new England squares.
  - An uplands-focused module continued to support country-specific habitat estimates.

## Sampling framework and allocation

- England, Scotland, Wales (and Isle of Man)
  - The classification framework was adapted to support country-unit estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland) with class subdivisions and aggregations where necessary.
  - Wales-specific detailing increased sampling for Welsh classes; England maintained adequate, though some classes had smaller sample counts.

- Sample squares and allocation
  - CS2000: total samples expanded to 569 across GB; distribution across classes varied to improve country-unit estimates.
  - CS2007: total samples adjusted to 591; Wales had increased coverage via additional Welsh-specific sub-classes and squares (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class).

- Upland and habitat-focused enhancements
  - Upland module added 30 squares to bolster the precision of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

## National estimates and data handling

- Estimation approach
  - National estimates are computed as the mean characteristics of features per land class multiplied by the total land area of that class.
  - As classifications evolved, estimates for GB could be derived using either the latest (country-specific) land classifications or the original 1990 classification; the latter provides cross-survey consistency, while the former aligns with current classifications.

- Practical implications
  - Changing the basic Land Classification affects the comparability of national stock estimates; the 2006 scoping study recommended using the latest country-specific classification for internal consistency, but the older classification aids cross-survey comparability.

## Key outputs and documentation

- Tables and maps
  - The document details per-class sample sizes, total squares surveyed, and sampling rates for CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
  - Revised Land Class maps illustrate England with Wales and Scotland (and Wales-specific Wales-class subdivisions in CS2007).

- Summary of survey years
  - 1978: 256 squares (8 per class; 32 classes).
  - 1984: 384 squares (12 per class; continued use of earlier framework for national estimates).
  - 1990: 508 squares; full GB coverage; new land classification approach.
  - 2000: 569 squares; country-unit framework introduced; 40 strata.
  - 2007: 591 squares; Wales-specific subdivisions introduced; 45 strata; upland module continuation.

## Implications for data analysts

- The Countryside Survey sampling strategy demonstrates a rigorous, history-informed approach to data collection, emphasizing:
  - Stratification by land class to capture ecological variability.
  - Adaptation to policy needs (country-specific reporting) while maintaining a coherent longitudinal framework.
  - The trade-off between using the latest classification for current estimates and maintaining cross-survey comparability.
  - The challenges of mapping administrative boundaries and ensuring representative sampling across diverse landscapes, including uplands.
