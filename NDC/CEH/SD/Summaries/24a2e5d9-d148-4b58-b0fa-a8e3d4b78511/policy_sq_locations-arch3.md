# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise the public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permissions.
- Public-interest justification for confidentiality; requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release conditions
- General access allows identification of whether squares fall within predetermined areas (country, county, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to indicate the 10x10 km grid location.
- Precise six-digit grid references are only possible in very exceptional circumstances, with UKCEH-preferred pre-processing to avoid release; external access requires demonstrating IP confidentiality at least equal to CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares can imply square locations and will be released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- License terms govern confidentiality, data storage, access, and restriction to named individuals and specific projects.

## Licenses and use restrictions
- Licenses must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and grant access only to individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmed destroyed at licence end.
- Data or derived information must not be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Licensees must not use data to identify specific CS squares or landowners, or to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project-management standards equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP) or higher.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Annual reporting to CS partners on licencing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- UKCEH may provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to using data covered by this policy.
- Collaboration or payment arrangements for UKCEH involvement are negotiated case-by-case.

## Process and compliance
- Interested parties should engage UKCEH to discuss licence requirements.
- Approved licences require sign-off by a senior authorised representative from the licensee organisation.
- If access is denied, decisions are supported by Act and Regulations.
- Ongoing governance and reporting to maintain transparency and accountability.

## Limitations and data categories
- The policy specifically governs location data for CS squares; other CS data (maps, habitat data, etc.) can be publicly accessible, but may still involve related considerations to prevent indirect location disclosure.
- Release decisions consider the potential for other data (e.g., maps) to disclose square locations and apply equivalent exceptional terms if needed.

## Partners and funding
- The 2024–2029 CS rolling program is funded by NERC through the UKCEH National Capability for UK Challenges Programme NE/Y006208/1.
- 2007 CS partners included NERC CEH, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.
