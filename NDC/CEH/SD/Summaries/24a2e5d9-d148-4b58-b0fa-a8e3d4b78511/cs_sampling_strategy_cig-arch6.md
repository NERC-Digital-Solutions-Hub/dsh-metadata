# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- The document documents the evolution of the Countryside Survey sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification from 1978 to 2007.
- It explains how stratified ecological sampling and the land classification underpin national, regional, and country-specific estimates of habitat and land-use features.

## Core concepts

- Stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage of Britain's varied landscapes.
- The ITE Land Classification (initially 32 classes) used to stratify GB into discrete strata for sampling.
- Field surveys were conducted in 1 km squares (with adjacent squares classified to give context).

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling

- 1978 (The Beginning)
  - 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes; centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid classified (1228 squares; plus 4 surrounding squares per centre).
  - 8 squares per land class surveyed (total 256).
  - Used to estimate national habitat areas via mean habitat area per square within each class and total class area.

- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Increased sample: 12 km squares per class (total 384).
  - England-wide implementation; national estimates still linked to the 1978 classification.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every GB 1 km square (still conservative; some squares reclassified).
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated 1984 quadrats; added Land Cover mapping linkage.
  - Shifts in class distribution required adjustments in how national estimates were calculated.

- 1998–2000 (Developments of the Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
  - Recognition that some classes were under-represented; framework expanded to support separate England & Wales and Scotland estimates.
  - New sub-divisions and aggregations created 40 strata (and later adjustments to 40-45 in later steps).
  - England & Wales and Scotland separate estimates implemented; additional samples added to improve country-specific representation.
  - Wales-specific sampling expanded to improve Wales reporting and upland habitat estimation.

- 2007 (Developments for Wales-only reporting; 5th Field Survey)
  - Welsh-only reporting necessitated further adjustments.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (5 new Welsh/English classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares; minimum 6 squares in each Welsh class; England adjustments retained.
  - Wales-focused upland sampling incorporated; England Welsh class representation balanced.

## Sampling framework and outputs

- Yearly progression of sampling intensity
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (all GB squares reclassified; 3rd field survey).
  - CS2000: 569 squares (broader country-based adjustments; upland module).
  - CS2007: 591 squares ( Wales-focused adjustments; 45 strata; upland emphasis).

- Country-specific focus and adjustments
  - Separate country estimates introduced to deliver England with Wales and Scotland estimates using country-specific squares.
  - Wales received enhanced sampling in CS2007 for Wales-only reporting; England adjustments balanced to maintain overall precision.

- Data products and usage
  - Land Classification maps for England with Wales and Scotland.
  - Tables and figures detailing sample distribution, class changes, and country-specific sampling rates.
  - National estimates involve linking field data to the ITE Land Classification and, when possible, to Land Cover imagery.

## Challenges and methodological notes

- Changing the underlying land classification affects the consistency of national stock estimates; the 2006 scoping study recommends using the latest country-specific classification for GB estimates for internal consistency, while older classifications may be used for cross-survey consistency.
- Representativeness issues arise when reclassifications shift square assignments; many non-identical squares still fall into neighboring classes with preserved average characteristics.
- Wales-only reporting required targeted expansion and subdivision of classes to achieve robust Wales estimates; similar logic applied to Scotland for country-specific reporting.
