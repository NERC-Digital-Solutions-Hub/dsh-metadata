# Greenhouse gas concentrations and physio-chemical water properties in the River Clyde catchment (January 2020 - December 2021)

- Purpose and scope
  - Two-year, multi-site monitoring to quantify sources, concentrations, fluxes and sinks of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) entering the Clyde from its catchment and estuary.
  - Aims to compare anthropogenic vs. natural sources and semi-natural, agricultural, and urban impacts.
  - Develop a model of controls and mechanisms governing GHG production, transport, and release to the atmosphere; identify conditions under which different sources/sinks are active.
  - Produce insights to inform policy decisions and future monitoring strategies.

- Monitoring framework and site design
  - 26 locations across the River Clyde and major tributaries, plus two Clyde estuary sites (E27, E28).
  - Sites distributed from near the source (e.g., Daer Water reservoir area) to Glasgow Green, with estuary points at the Clyde estuary.
  - Sampling aligned with SEPA gauging stations where possible; some measurements not at exact gauging points.
  - Distances reported from source to sea; tributaries’ entry points into the Clyde are listed with italicized distance values.
  - Sampling regime: monthly collection over 2020–2021, totaling 21 campaigns (interrupted Apr–Jun 2020 due to Covid-19); each campaign spanned two consecutive days (upper catchment on day 1, lower catchment on day 2).

- Sampling methods and field measurements
  - Water samples collected in 10 L plastic buckets from river banks or bridges; sub-samples processed in lab the same day.
  - In situ measurements: conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), DO%, pH (measured 10 cm below surface).
  - Headspace gas sampling for dissolved gas concentrations using three 200 mL syringes per location; ambient air samples collected for each location.
  - All samples frozen/refrigerated as needed; detailed site notes and photos provided in Appendix 1.

- Analytical methods and parameters
  - Gas analysis: headspace GC (Agilent 7890B) with headspace auto-sampler to quantify CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations; concentrations referenced to a set of gas standards.
  - Water chemistry (filtered samples): DOC, TDN, TDC; DIC calculated from DOC vs. TDC; SUVA254 measured to assess aromaticity of DOC.
  - Ion chromatography: major anions/cations (Cl-, NO3-, SO4-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) using a Metrohm IC Flex with mixed standards; some samples affected by high Na+ peaks obscuring NH4+.
  - Nutrients and phosphorus: total phosphorus (TP) via acid digestion and colorimetric orthophosphate measurement; TOC analyzer for TDN, TDC, DOC; non-filtered TP analysis preserved by freezing.
  - Data handling: all samples analyzed in runs including multiple standards; samples processed the same or subsequent days with consistent QA/QC.

- Quality control, data handling, and data products
  - Field and lab instrument calibration prior to use; multiple standards included in each run.
  - Data quality controlled via time-series and spatial plotting, outlier checks, rate of change, spikes, stationarity, and comparison with river flow data.
  - Suspect data removed and flagged with an asterisk; missing data noted (e.g., weather-related inaccessibility, Covid-related gaps).
  - Data structured with detailed metadata fields (survey name, location code, sample code, coordinates, date, time, depth, conductance, temp, pH, DO, DO%, SUVA, DOC/TDN/TDC/DIC, TP, ions, gas partial pressures, saturations, concentrations, and related carbon metrics).
  - Appendix 1 provides sample locations with coordinates, sampling notes, and photographs.

- Gas chemistry and calculations
  - Dissolved gas concentrations and partial pressures calculated via a mass-balance approach using equilibration headspace data.
  - Key equations relate liquid and gas phases with volumes, barometric pressure, temperature-adjusted solubility (βT), and gas partial pressures.
  - Concentrations converted to μmol/L and then to ppmv using the Ideal Gas Law (RT approach).
  - Reported gas-related metrics include pCH4 air, pCO2 air, pN2O air, CH4 Sat, CO2 Sat, N2O Sat, CH4 concentration (μmol/L), CH4-C, CO2 concentration (μmol/L), CO2-C, N2O concentration (μmol/L), and N2O-N (μg/L).

- Data types, units, and documentation
  - Comprehensive table of data columns and units (Table 2) covering survey metadata, location, sampling details, physico-chemical measurements, dissolved gases, and carbon/nitrogen/ nutrient parameters.
  - Some data gaps noted (e.g., Mouse Water not sampled before Aug 2020; snow/ice barriers in Jan–Feb 2021; certain estuary/urban locations with measurement limitations due to high Na+ or access issues).
  - Data points marked with asterisks to indicate missing values or measurements not achievable under certain conditions (e.g., NH4+ data obscured by Na+ peaks).

- Site-specific notes and context
  - Appendix 1 includes narrative descriptions and photos for each sampling site, indicating landscape context (semi-natural, rural, suburban, urban), sampling point (bank, bridge, or pontoon), and proximity to SEPA gauges or outfalls.
  - Estuary sites reflect urban-influenced conditions (Govan Pontoon, Braehead Pontoon) near wastewater and industrial outfalls.

- Implications for monitoring framework authors
  - Demonstrates a robust, long-term, multi-parameter monitoring approach linking catchment processes to GHG fluxes and atmospheric release.
  - Highlights the importance of aligning field sampling with existing gauging networks, ensuring standardized measurement protocols, and maintaining rigorous QA/QC.
  - Shows the value and challenges of metadata richness, data accessibility, and handling missing data due to weather or public-health-related disruptions.
  - Provides a detailed data schema and documentation that could inform data governance, metadata standards, and transparent reporting for monitoring frameworks.
  - Underlines potential data interpretation challenges in urban/industrial-influenced reach due to interference (e.g., NH4+ vs. Na+ signals) and seasonal accessibility constraints, which should be anticipated in monitoring designs.
