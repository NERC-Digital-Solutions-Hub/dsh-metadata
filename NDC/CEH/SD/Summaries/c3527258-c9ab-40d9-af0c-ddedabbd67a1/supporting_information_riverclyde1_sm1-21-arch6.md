# River Clyde GHG and Water Chemistry Study

## Overview
- A two-year study (January 2020 – December 2021) measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and physio-chemical water properties.
- Conducted at 26 locations along the River Clyde and major tributaries, plus 2 locations in the Clyde estuary.
- Purpose: understand GHG sources and sinks, their mechanisms, and how anthropogenic, semi-natural, agricultural, and urban impacts influence them; develop a model of production, transport, and release to the atmosphere; identify conditions under which different sources and sinks are active.

## Study Objectives
- Quantify sources, concentrations, fluxes, and sinks of GHGs entering the Clyde (source-to-sea); compare anthropogenic vs non-anthropogenic and land-use impacts.
- Develop a model for controls and mechanisms of GHG production, transport, consumption, and atmospheric release.
- Determine conditions under which different sources and sinks are active across the catchment, river, and estuary.

## Site Description and Data Collection
- 26 measurement locations along the River Clyde and major tributaries; 2 estuary locations (E27, E28).
- Locations span from near-source (Daer Water above Daer reservoir) to Glasgow Green (above Clyde tidal weir).
- Sampling sites labeled: C (Clyde), T (tributary), L (inflow from loch), E (estuary); distances increase downstream.
- SEPA gauging stations used where possible; not always at exact gauges.
- Monthly sampling from Jan 2020 to Dec 2021; 21 campaigns in total (April–June 2020 paused due to Covid-19).
- Each campaign conducted over two consecutive days (upper catchment Day 1, lower catchment Day 2); some detailed location information in Table 1 and Appendix 1.

## Sampling Regime
- Water collected in 10 L plastic buckets; measurements not taken directly in-river.
- In-field measurements: conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), DO %, pH at 10 cm depth using portable meter and probes.
- 2 L sub-sample for lab analyses, kept cooled.
- Dissolved gas samples collected in triplicate using headspace method before disturbing water, plus ambient air samples.
- Headspace setup: three 200 mL syringes, equilibrated by shaking; air and water equilibrated gas vials prepared for GC analysis.

## Analytical Methods
- Gas analysis: headspace samples analyzed with Agilent 7890B GC and 7697A headspace autosampler to quantify CO2, CH4, and N2O; multiple gas standards used per run.
- Water chemistry (on return to lab, same day): filtered samples for TDN, TDC, DOC via Shimadzu TOC-L; DIC derived from TDC and DOC; SUVA254 via UV/Vis to assess aromaticity and potential anthropogenic influence.
- Ion chromatography: major ions (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) with Metrohm IC Flex; dilution and standards used for calibration; high urban concentrations noted (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+).
- Total phosphorus (TP): unfiltered samples digested (K2S2O8) and measured colorimetrically; orthophosphate as the measured form.
- Sample handling: all surveys run consecutively; some samples frozen/thawed during processing; random order across surveys.
- Data largely compiled by researchers (noted authors).

## Gas Partial Pressures
- Dissolved gas concentrations derived from headspace equilibrations using a mass-balance formulation.
- Equilibrium relationships with gas phase partial pressures, barometric pressure, and temperature-dependent Bunsen solubility coefficients.
- Concentrations converted to ppmv via the Ideal Gas Law (ppmv = μmol/L × R × T).

## Nature and Units of Recorded Values
- Missing data flagged with an asterisk.
- Not all data collected at every site/time due to weather and equipment limitations:
  - No data at Mouse Water prior to Aug 2020.
  - Snow/inaccessible conditions prevented data at Roger Clench (T1) and Daer Water reservoir inflow (C2) in Jan-Feb 2021.
  - Some sites missing in Jan 2020 (C16, E27, E28).
  - DO measurements began December 2021; NH4+ detection can be confounded by high Na+ at certain sites (asterisks used where applicable).
- Table 2 provides detailed units for all parameters (e.g., pH, conductivity, temperature, DO, DOC, TDN, TP, SUVA254, various ions, gas partial pressures, CH4/CO2/N2O, and related concentrations).

## Quality Control
- Field and laboratory calibration and checks prior to use.
- Data quality controlled via time-series and spatial analyses, checking for outliers, rapid changes, spikes, and stationarity; compared against river flow data.
- Suspect data removed and flagged with asterisk.

## Outputs and Data Availability
- Data organized in CSV with detailed column definitions (including location, date, time, depth, and a wide set of chemical and gas measurements).
- Appendix 1 provides comprehensive sample locations with coordinates, river names, and sampling notes; includes photos.
- Study outputs intended to support understanding of GHG sources/sinks and to inform data-driven models of GHG dynamics in the Clyde system.

- Each site description notes sampling point (bank, bridge, or pontoon) and proximity to gauging stations or notable features.
