# River Clyde greenhouse gases and water chemistry data (January 2020 – December 2021)

- A two-year field study measuring greenhouse gas concentrations (CO2, CH4, N2O) and physio-chemical water properties across 26 locations in the River Clyde catchment and two Clyde estuary sites to understand sources, sinks, and mechanisms, and to develop a predictive model of GHG production, transport, and release.

## Study objectives
- Quantify sources, concentrations, fluxes, and sinks of GHGs entering the Clyde (source-to-sea) and compare anthropogenic and natural sources, including semi-natural, agricultural, and urban influences.
- Develop a model of controls and mechanisms governing GHG production, transport, and atmospheric release.
- Determine conditions under which different sources and sinks are active within the catchment, river, and estuary, and their associated mechanisms.

## Site description and data collection
- 26 sampling locations along the River Clyde and major tributaries, plus 2 estuary sites (E27, E28). Sampling points span from near-source areas to Glasgow Green, with estuary sites at the Clyde estuary.
- Locations aligned with SEPA gauging stations where possible; not all measurements at exact gauging points.
- Sampling occurred monthly (Jan 2020 – Dec 2021) with 21 campaigns total; no sampling Apr–Jun 2020 due to Covid-19 restrictions.
- Each campaign covered upper catchment (day 1) and lower catchment (day 2); details and coordinates provided in tables and Appendix 1.

## Sampling regime
- Water samples collected in 10 L plastic buckets from banks or bridges (not direct in-stream measurements).
- In-field measurements: conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, DO%, pH at 10 cm below surface.
- Sub-samples: 2 L sampled for laboratory analysis; samples stored in cool boxes until return.
- Dissolved gas samples collected in triplicate using headspace method with ambient air samples; three 200 mL syringes used to equilibrate gas concentrations; vials prepared for GC analysis.
- Ambient photographs and site context documented (Appendix 1).

## Analytical methods
- Gas analysis: headspace samples analyzed with a GC (Agilent 7890B) and headspace auto-sampler to quantify CO2, CH4, and N2O; calibration with mixed standards in each run.
- Water chemistry: filtration in the lab (Whatman GF/F 0.7 µm) for dissolved nutrients and carbon species; analyses included:
  - Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved carbon (TDC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC); dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) derived from TDC–DOC.
  - Total phosphorus (TP) via acid digestion and colorimetric method.
  - SUVA254 via UV absorbance to assess aromaticity and anthropogenic influence on DOC.
  - Ion chromatography for major anions/cations (Cl-, NO3-, SO4-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+).
- Sample handling: randomised, run together by survey; some samples frozen/refrigerated between collection and analysis due to logistic constraints.
- Data management and analysis conducted under IAPETUS 2 DTP NERC framework.

## Gas partial pressures and conversions
- Gas–liquid mass balance used to calculate dissolved gas concentrations and gas partial pressures from headspace data.
- Equilibrium assumption and solubility coefficients applied; results converted to ppmv using the Ideal Gas Law, with barometric pressure and temperature adjustments.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Comprehensive table of variables and units; missing data indicated by asterisk in the CSV.
- Notable data gaps:
  - T13 (Mouse Water) missing prior to Aug 2020.
  - Roger Clench (T1) and Daer Water reservoir inflow (C2) inaccessible in Jan–Feb 2021 due to snow.
  - Some locations lacked data in Jan 2020 for Garrion Bridge (C16) and estuary sites E27, E28.
  - DO measured only from December 2021 onward.
  - Ammonium data impacted by high Na+ in some estuary/urban tributaries; such values marked as missing.
- Table 2 (not reproduced here) details the exact column names, units, and data types for the dataset.

## Quality control
- Field and lab instruments calibrated and checked; multiple standards included in each run.
- Data quality assessed via time-series and spatial plots, screening for outliers, rate-of-change, spikes, and stationarity; hydrological context used to interpret data.
- Suspect data removed and flagged as missing with an asterisk.

## Appendix and sample locations
- Appendix 1 provides detailed sample locations with coordinates, distances from the source, river name, and site-specific notes.
- Site descriptions include landscape context (semi-natural, rural, suburban, urban) and sampling specifics (bank, bridge, or pontoon access).
- Visual examples illustrate pollution sources and conditions (e.g., pollution in Avon Water, scum in South Calder Water).

- The dataset supports cross-site comparisons of GHG fluxes and dissolved gas dynamics, linking catchment land use and point sources (e.g., urban outfalls, UWWTPs) to observed GHG production, transport, and emission to the atmosphere.
