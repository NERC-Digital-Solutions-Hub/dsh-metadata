# The WATCH Forcing Data 1958-2001: a meteorological forcing dataset for land surface- and hydrological-models

- This data chunk provides basin-by-basin time-series details for key meteorological and evapotranspiration variables used to drive land surface and hydrological models.
- Variables covered (for multiple basins): PET_rc, PET_PT, Net Rad (W/m2), VPD (kPa), Wind (m/s), Rainfall (mm/yr), Snowfall (mm/yr), Precipitation (mm/yr).
- Time periods presented:
  - 1901-1957
  - 1958-2001
  - 1979-2001 (where available)
- For each basin and variable/time period, the data include:
  - Average value
  - Slope (units/yr) with a range (slope-min to slope-max)
  - Effective sample size (Neff)
  - Adjusted Slope P value (statistical significance)
- Purpose: illustrate basin-scale trends and uncertainties within the WATCH Forcing Data framework, particularly how PET and other drivers evolve from pre-1958 ERA-40-based data through the 20th century.

  - Murray-Darling River Basin:
    - PET_rc and PET_PT values show basin-specific patterns (not all values shown here) with intermittent trends; Appendix includes overall PET_rc trends and PET_PT trends across 1901-1957, 1958-2001, and 1979-2001 windows.
    - Net Rad, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, and Precipitation follow the general WATCH data structure with period-specific averages and slopes indicated.
- Appendix and data construction notes:
  - Appendix Table 1 documents the order of ERA-40 basis years used for 1901-1957, showing how basis years map to WFD years (e.g., ERA-40 year 1974 corresponds to 1901 in the first row, etc.).
  - Data quality considerations are noted for pre-1958 periods, including data sparseness and potential biases in ERA-40 surface variables that influence interannual variability and trend estimates.
  - PET_rc generally shows declines in the 1958-2001 window across many basins, whereas PET_PT often increases in the same window, leading to differing model results depending on PET formulation.
  - Users should account for increased uncertainty in 1901-1957 data due to randomization of ERA-40 years and limited pre-1950 observations.

- Practical takeaway for data support and modeling:
  - The table provides basin-specific, bias-corrected forcing components essential for historical hydrological and land-surface simulations.
  - PET_rc vs PET_PT yields different regional trends; select PET formulation consistent with modeling goals and validate against local observations where possible.
  - The 1901-1957 data carry higher uncertainty; treat trend inferences for that period with caution in historical analyses.
  - The dataset preserves diurnal-to-seasonal variability and inter-variable covariances, supporting robust multi-variable analyses across basins.
