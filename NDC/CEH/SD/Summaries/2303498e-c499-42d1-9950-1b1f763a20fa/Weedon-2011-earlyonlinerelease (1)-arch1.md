# WATCH Forcing Data and its use to assess global and regional reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century

- The provided text comprises basin-scale results (Appendix Table entries) from the WATCH Forcing Data study, focusing on how reference evapotranspiration (PET) estimates respond to driving variables across 1901–1957, 1958–2001, and 1979–2001 for several major river basins.
- Key variables reported per basin and period include PET rc (Penman–Monteith with a grass reference), PET PT (Priestley–Taylor alternative), Net Radiation, VPD (vapor pressure deficit), Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, and Precipitation, along with statistical indicators (Slope, 95% indicators via Neff, and Adjusted Slope P values).

    - Net Radiation, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, Precipitation: mixed trends with some significant early-period signals (e.g., VPD 1901–1957 with p < 0.050) but generally weaker or mixed significance in later periods.
  - Lena River Basin

    - PET PT: 1901–1957 average 312.82 mm/yr; slope 0.1505 (p > 0.200). 1958–2001 average 313.48 mm/yr; slope 0.2437 (p < 0.050). 1979–2001 average 314.73 mm/yr; slope 0.4203 (p > 0.200).
    - Net Radiation, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, Precipitation: generally modest trends with some periods showing small but detectable changes; precipitation signals variable.
  - Ganges–Brahmaputra River Basin
    - PET rc: 1901–1957 average 889.32 mm/yr; slope 0.0368 (p > 0.200). 1958–2001 average 869.68 mm/yr; slope −2.2561 (p < 0.001). 1979–2001 average 843.63 mm/yr; slope −1.8416 (p > 0.200).
    - PET PT: 1901–1957 average 798.70 mm/yr; slope 0.0968 (p > 0.200). 1958–2001 average 767.99 mm/yr; slope −1.2596 (p < 0.001). 1979–2001 average 752.00 mm/yr; slope −0.8951 (p > 0.200).
    - Net Radiation, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, Precipitation: notable decreases in PET variables during 1958–2001 driven by changes in net radiation and VPD; rainfall shows regional variability with some periods of increase and others of decline.
  - Murray–Darling River Basin
    - Data present in the table but not fully displayed in this excerpt (partial placeholders), indicating incomplete or unavailable basin-specific numbers within this chunk.
  - Note: The entries consistently include Neff (effective sample size) and Adjusted Slope P values to indicate statistical significance.

- Global and regional patterns (as reflected in the basin data)
  - 1958–2001 often shows stronger indications of change in PET rc and PET PT in several basins, frequently linked to shifts in net radiation and VPD, with basin-specific nuances (e.g., declines in PET rc in some basins like Ganges–Brahmaputra).
  - PET rc and PET PT can diverge within the same basin, underscoring sensitivity to the chosen PET formulation and driving variables.
  - Precipitation signals are highly regionally variable; some basins exhibit increases while others show declines, with substantial differences in significance across periods.
  - The data highlight substantial regional heterogeneity in the 20th century hydrological responses, warning against over-generalization in cross-basin analyses.

- Implications for analysts
  - PET rc vs PET PT choice materially affects inferred evapotranspiration and hydrological budgets; expect model spread when using different PET formulations.
  - Basin-level trends are strongly influenced by changes in net radiation and VPD; local atmospheric and radiative forcings drive the majority of observed PET shifts.
  - Regional rainfall and snowfall signals can either amplify or dampen PET-related trends; data interpretation should rely on period-specific and basin-specific context.
  - The presence of significant early-period signals (1901–1957) in some basins and stronger later-period signals (1958–2001) suggests different driving mechanisms and data quality constraints across eras.
  - For modeling and decision-support, incorporate uncertainty in pre-1958 ERA-40 baselines and consider data sparsity in certain basins (e.g., Murray–Darling) when interpreting long-term trends.

- Appendix notes and context
  - The excerpt is part of Appendix Table 1, which documents the order of ERA-40 basis years used in the WATCH Forcing Data for 1901–1957, showing how basis years alternate between ERA-40 and WATCH Forcing Data years to construct historical forcing.
  - The overall study emphasizes the need to account for data quality, bias corrections, and methodological choices when interpreting century-scale hydrological drivers and evaporation responses.
