# FADOE_visitation.csv

- Purpose: Document Brassica nigra flower visitation frequencies by pollinating insects across 2018 and 2019 under Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) treatments to assess environmental health and pollination under pollution exposure.

## Experimental design

- Observation units: patches of 6 adjacent plants observed for 5–10 minutes per session.
- Rings and location: FADOE rings distributed within a wheat field; two locations per ring (Field in 2018; moved to adjacent field in 2019) to enable spatial comparison.
- Treatments: four pollution treatments per year—diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O3), diesel exhaust plus ozone (D+O3), and a control in natural air (CON).
- Rotation: one week in 2019 where treatments were rotated between rings to quantify spatial variation in pollinator foraging behavior relative to treatment.

## Data collection and variables

- Recorder and timing: Observations made by trained insect identifiers; start time, finish time, and duration recorded (per observation).
- Flowers observed: number of flowers in the observation unit recorded.
- Pollinator groups counted: counts of insects visiting the observation unit for multiple groups (e.g., honey bee, solitary bee, bumblebee, hoverfly, butterfly, moth, and many other insect categories).
- Visits and per-insect metrics: 
  - Number of visits per pollinator group
  - Number of flowers visited per pollinator group
  - Average visits per insect for key groups
  - Total insect counts, total flower visits, and visits per insect
- Normalized rates: 
  - Insect counts per flower per hour
  - Flower visits per flower per hour
- Observational metadata: Year and Date, Ring number, Location, Treatment, and Rotation status (for one-week rotation in 2019).

## Derived data and processing

- Standardized calculations to derive:
  - Insect counts per hour and flower visits per hour
  - Visits per insect and visits per flower per hour by pollinator group
- Data scaling: frequencies adjusted according to the number of flowers and observation duration to allow cross-unit comparisons.

## Spatial and temporal scope

- Years: 2018 and 2019
- Locations: two per ring due to field movement between years
- Temporal markers: Date and specific observation times; one-week rotation period in 2019 to assess spatial treatment effects

## Data quality, provenance, and access

- Data provenance: Collected by trained observers using standardized protocols to ensure consistency across rings and treatments.
- Data quality: Observers trained in insect identification; standardized recording of counts, floral abundance, and timing.
- Accessibility: Dataset designed for storage and upload to appropriate data portals; structured to support reuse and cross-study integration.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and use

- Enables assessment of pollinator activity and pollination potential under air pollution treatments.
- Provides standardized, comparable metrics (counts, visits, rates) suitable for monitoring environmental health and for evaluating policy/performance over time.
- Rotation design helps separate treatment effects from spatial variation, enhancing robustness for environmental impact analyses.

## Considerations for analysts

- Useful for combining with atmospheric or pollution exposure data to model treatment effects on pollination dynamics.
- Cross-year and cross-location design facilitates spatial-temporal trend analyses.
- Ensure consistent unit handling and alignment of derived metrics when integrating with other environmental datasets.
