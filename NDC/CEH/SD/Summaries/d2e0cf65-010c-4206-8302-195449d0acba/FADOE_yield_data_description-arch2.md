# FADOE_yield.csv

## Overview
- Dataset of post-flowering yield characteristics for Brassica nigra in Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings.
- Collected over two years (2018 and 2019) across multiple field locations and pollution treatments.
- Aims to support environmental health monitoring by quantifying plant-level yield responses to pollution treatments.

## Experimental Design and Data Collection
- Field setup:
  - Two rings per pollution treatment across four treatments: diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O3), diesel exhaust and ozone combined (D+O3), and control (CON).
  - Each ring contained 24 Brassica nigra plants.
  - Rings moved from a field in 2018 (lat 51.482853, lon -0.897749) to an adjacent field in 2019 (lat 51.482374, lon -0.895855).
- Sampling and harvesting:
  - Plants were sampled until flowering ceased, then allowed to mature under an insect mesh-covered polytunnel to minimize additional insect damage.
  - Harvest occurred after maturation.
  - Pod and seed measurements were taken from the third raceme up from the main stem.
- Measurements per plant:
  - Developed pods and undeveloped pods counts; percent pod development.
  - Ten pods bagged for drying and weighing.
  - Pod and seed metrics derived from the bagged pods (mass of pods, mass of seeds in bagged pods, seeds per pod).
  - Aboveground plant dry mass (after drying to constant weight).
  - Seeds from the threshing process: seeds counted and weighed for the plant.
  - Totals: total seeds and total seed mass, including seeds in pods.

## Key Variables and Measurements
- Temporal and spatial context:
  - Year (2018, 2019)
  - Ring identifier (Ring)
  - Treatment (D, O3, D+O3, CON)
  - Plant-level observations (Plant no.)
- Yield and pod metrics:
  - No. developed pods
  - No. undeveloped pods
  - % pod development
  - No. pods bagged
  - Mass of pods
  - Individual pod mass
- Seed metrics (pods and plants):
  - No. seeds (pods)
  - Mass of seeds in bagged pods
  - No. seeds total (including seeds in pods)
  - Seed mass total (including seeds in pods)
  - No. seeds (plant)
  - Seed mass (plant)
- Plant biomass:
  - Plant dry mass
  - Total seed mass (from the plant)

## Processing and Derived Metrics
- Derived calculations include:
  - Pod development percentage per plant
  - Seeds per pod
  - Total seed numbers and total seed mass per plant
- Sample handling and preparation:
  - Pods and seeds dried/processed under standardized conditions (oven drying at 70°C for pod samples).
  - Systematic counting and weighing to support consistent comparisons across rings and treatments.

## Temporal and Spatial Context
- Two-year field study with explicit field movement between 2018 and 2019.
- Geographic coordinates provided for each year’s field location, enabling spatial comparisons.
- Treatments intended to simulate varying pollution exposure and to assess direct yield responses under controlled, yet field-based, enrichment conditions.

## Relevance for Environmental Analysts
- Enables assessment of pollution treatment effects (diesel, ozone, combined) on Brassica nigra yield components (pod development, pod/seed mass, seed counts).
- Facilitates integration with other environmental data (e.g., atmospheric measurements, weather, soil data) to evaluate broader ecological and policy-relevant outcomes.
- Supports standardised reporting and cross-study comparisons through clearly defined metrics and processing steps.

## Data Quality and Accessibility Considerations
- Data produced from a controlled field experiment with standardized measurement protocols (consistent pod and seed sampling, drying, and weighing).
- Documentation includes explicit collection and processing methods, aiding quality assurance and reproducibility.
- For broader use, consider linking to underlying exposure data (treatment assignments, ring-level data) and metadata on field conditions to maximize dataset value and facilitate data sharing.
