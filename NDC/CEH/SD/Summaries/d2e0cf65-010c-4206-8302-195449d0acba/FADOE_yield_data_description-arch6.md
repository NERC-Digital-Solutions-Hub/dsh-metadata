# FADOE_yield.csv

- Overview
  - Post-flowering yield characteristics of Brassica nigra plants under Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings.
  - Collected over two years (2018 and 2019) in field experiments, with rings moved between fields between years.
  - Fields: 2018 at latitude 51.482853, longitude -0.897749; 2019 moved to adjacent field at latitude 51.482374, longitude -0.895855.
  - Experimental treatments include diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O3), diesel + ozone (D+O3), and control (CON).

- Experimental design
  - 8 FADOE rings in total, with two rings assigned to each of four treatments.
  - Each ring contained 24 plants.
  - Rings relocated from one field to an adjacent field from 2018 to 2019.
  - Plants harvested after flowering ceased; mature in an insect mesh-covered polytunnel before harvest.
  - Data collected per plant and per pod/seed components to assess yield and development under different pollutants.

- Measurements and components recorded
  - Pod development
    - No. developed pods (per plant)
    - No. undeveloped pods (per plant)
    - % pod development
  - Pod sampling and mass
    - No. pods bagged (ten random pods sampled per plant/ring)
    - Mass of pods
    - Pod mass (specific metric derived from pod samples)
  - Seed metrics (from pods and plant)

    - Seed mass total (including seeds in pods)
  - Plant-level metric
    - Plant dry mass
  - Process details
    - Pods and seeds processed through oven-drying (70 °C)
    - Seeds separated, counted, and weighed after thrashing
    - All counts/weights used to compute derived metrics (e.g., total seed numbers, total seed mass)

- Data quality and preparation (Data Support considerations)
  - Two-year, field-m relocation may introduce site-year effects; ensure alignment of Ring × Treatment across years.
  - Sample size: 24 plants per ring; 8 rings per year; plan for 192 plants per year (approx.).
  - Data may require cleaning for missing values or outliers in counts and masses.
  - Provides opportunities to create self-service analyses (dashboards, pivot tables) to compare yield components by treatment and year.

- Practical uses and outputs
  - Compare the effects of diesel, ozone, and combined exposure on pod development, pod and seed yields, and overall plant biomass.
  - Derive productivity metrics such as percent pod development, seeds per plant, and total seed mass across treatments and years.
  - Generate dashboards or reports to communicate treatment effects to stakeholders and support policy or environmental impact discussions.
