# Outdoor and indoor cadmium distributions near an abandoned smelting works and their relations to human exposure

## Overview
- Investigates outdoor and indoor cadmium distributions around an abandoned smelting works and how these distributions relate to human exposure.
- Employs standardized soil sampling, digestion, and instrumental analysis to enable cross-site comparison and potential linkage to exposure assessments.

## Study design and sampling
- Two sets of soil samples: grid-based near the smelter and targeted locations further away.
- Nested grid approach:
  - 1 km grid within 5 km of the smelter.
  - 5 km grid from 5 to 15 km radius (westerly sampling limited by the Bristol Channel).
- 44 locations sampled in October 2007.
- Purpose: allow cross-comparison with national monitoring programs.

## Field sampling methods
- At each of the 44 grid sites: five separate soil cores (15 cm deep × 4 cm) collected within a 10 m × 10 m area.
- Cores pooled to provide a homogeneous sample for the location.

## Sample processing and preparation
- Soils air-dried; large roots and stones removed by sieving through a 2 mm mesh.
- Sub-sampling by coning and quartering; milled with a non-metallic agate ball mill.
- Prior to analysis, prepared samples homogenised for digestion.

## Laboratory analysis
- Digestion: 0.5 g soil digested in 12 mL aqua regia (HCl:HNO3) using microwave digestion up to 200 °C.
- Metals measured in digests by ICP-MS (Perkin Elmer Elan DRC II) with matrix-matched calibrants.
- Internal standards: Ga, In, Re to correct for drift.
- Detection limit for Cd: 0.02 μg g⁻¹.
- Analyzed elements: Cd, Al, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, As, Pb, Hg.
- QA: included certified soil reference (ISE 921) with each batch; recoveries reported (Cd 96.3%; Al 42.3%; Cr 78.0%; Cu 89.5%; Zn 85.7%; Ni 85.6%; As 104%; Pb 93.4%; Hg 109%).

## Soil characterisation (pH and organic matter)
- Soil organic matter content determined by furnace combustion at 375 °C.
- pH measured using a 1:2.5 (soil:water) suspension with a pH electrode.

## Data quality and comparability
- Use of standardized sampling (nested grid, 5 cores per site) and aqua regia digestion with ICP-MS ensures cross-site comparability.
- Quality control includes a certified soil reference standard and recovery checks to validate metal measurements.
- Methodological references cited underpin the analytical approach (e.g., Allen 1989; Jones 1991; Spurgeon et al. 2008).

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Demonstrates a rigorous, standardised workflow suitable for environmental health surveillance and exposure assessment.
- Aligns with broader monitoring programs to enhance data value and accessibility, addressing the common challenges of data integration and data sharing.
