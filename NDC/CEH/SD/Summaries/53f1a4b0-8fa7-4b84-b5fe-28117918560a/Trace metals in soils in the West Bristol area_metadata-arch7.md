# Materials and methods (from Outdoor and indoor cadmium distributions near an abandoned smelting works and their relations to human exposure)

- Study design and sampling
  - Two soil sampling campaigns were used: a nested grid-based set within 5 km of the smelter and a 5–15 km outer grid (44 locations in total; October 2007)
  - Sampling sites were on publicly accessible land with mixed vegetation
  - At each of the 44 sites, five soil cores (15 cm deep × 4 cm) were collected within a 10 m × 10 m area and pooled to form a homogeneous sample
- Grid layout and coverage
  - 1 km grid within 5 km of the smelter
  - 5 km grid from 5 to 15 km radius (westerly sampling limited by Bristol Channel)
- Sample processing
  - Soils were air-dried, sieved to remove large roots/stones (2 mm mesh)
  - A portion of air-dried soil was coned and quartered and milled with a non-metallic agate ball mill
  - Total metal concentrations (Cd and Al, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, As, Pb, Hg) determined after aqua regia digestion (0.5 g soil in 12 mL aqua regia) with microwave digestion up to 200°C
- Analytical methods
  - ICP-MS analysis using Perkin Elmer Elan DRC II; matrix-matched calibrants
  - Internal standards: Ga, In, Re
  - Detection limits set as four times the standard deviation of blank replicates
  - Cd detection limit: 0.02 μg g^-1
- Quality control
  - Certified soil reference ISE 921 included with each batch; recoveries vs. certified values: Cd 96.3%; Al 42.3%; Cr 78.0%; Cu 89.5%; Zn 85.7%; Ni 85.6%; As 104%; Pb 93.4%; Hg 109%
- Additional soil characteristics
  - Soil organic matter content measured by furnace combustion at 375°C (Allen, 1989)
  - Soil pH measured with a electrode in a 1:2.5 soil:water suspension
- Key references
  - Allen (Chemical Analysis of Ecological Materials, 1989)
  - Jones (Biological Monitoring of Metal Pollution in Terrestrial Ecosystems, 1991)
  - Spurgeon et al. (Geographical and pedological drivers of distribution and risks to soil fauna of seven metals, Environmental Pollution, 2008)

# GIS considerations and data quality

- Spatial data context
  - Attributes include precise spatial coordinates (Easting/Northing) suitable for GIS mapping on British National Grid
  - Distance to smelter provides a proximity measure for spatial analyses
- Data integration
  - Multiple metals with uniform units (mg/kg) and consistent digestion/measurement methods facilitate multi-layer map visuals
  - Differences in sampling resolution (1 km near vs. 5 km outer grids) should be accounted for in analyses and visualization
- Data quality and limitations
  - QA results indicate generally good accuracy for key metals, with Cd recoveries high and other metals showing satisfactory recoveries; note especially variable Al recovery (42.3%)
  - Data gathered from two distinct grid schemes and a single campaign; consider temporal context (October 2007) when comparing with other datasets
- Applications for GIS specialists
  - Create choropleth or point-based maps of metal concentrations, distance-to-smelter analyses, and correlations with soil properties (pH, organic matter)
  - Integrate with other spatial layers (land use, exposure pathways) for environmental health or policy-oriented visualizations
- References and provenance
  - Data documentation aligned with methodologies from the cited studies; ensure proper citation in maps and metadata
