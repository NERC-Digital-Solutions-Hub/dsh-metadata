- Materials and methods (study context and analytical workflow)
  - Sampling design
    - Two soil sampling sets: grid-based and targeted.
    - Nested grid approach within 5 km of the smelter (1 km grid) and extending up to 15 km (5 km grid).
    - Total of 44 locations sampled in October 2007.
    - Sampling sites on publicly accessible land with mixed grass/vegetation where possible.
    - At each site: five 15 cm deep × 4 cm diameter cores within a 10 m × 10 m area; cores pooled to form a single homogenized sample per location.
  - Soil processing and preparation
    - Soils homogenised, air-dried, roots/stones removed (2 mm sieve).
    - Sub-sampling by coning and quartering; milled with non-metallic agate mill.
  - Chemical analysis
    - Total metal concentrations (Cd and a suite of metals: Al, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, As, Pb, Hg) determined after aqua regia digestion via microwave digestion (0.5 g soil, 12 mL aqua regia, up to 200°C).
    - Measurements by Perkin Elmer Elan DRC II ICP-MS.
    - Internal standards: Ga, In, Re to correct drift.
    - Method detection/limits: Cd detection limit 0.02 μg g-1 (4× SD of blanks considered with sample weight and digestion volume).
  - Quality control and certified reference materials
    - Included a certified soil (ISE 921, Wageningen University) with each batch.
    - Recovery comparisons to certified values: Cd 96.3%; Al 42.3%; Cr 78.0%; Cu 89.5%; Zn 85.7%; Ni 85.6%; As 104%; Pb 93.4%; Hg 109%.
    - High Cd recoveries support validity of measured Cd concentrations.
  - Ancillary soil measurements
    - Soil organic matter content (LOI) by furnace combustion at 375°C (Allen, 1989).
    - Soil pH measured by electrode in a 1:2.5 soil:water suspension (Allen, 1989).

- Data quality, limitations, and governance implications for monitoring
  - Detection limits and QA/QC
    - Cd detection limit established; use of certified reference material with reported recoveries demonstrates measurement reliability for the suite of metals, though some metals show variable recoveries (e.g., Al at 42.3%).
  - Metadata and transparency
    - Detailed method descriptions (digestion, instrumentation, internal standards, QA/QC) essential for data reuse and cross-study comparability.
    - Clear documentation of grid design and site selection enhances interpretability for exposure assessment and spatial monitoring.
  - Data accessibility and sharing
    - The study demonstrates the value of sharing data (including underlying datasets) to support policy decisions, but notes potential barriers to public sharing of datasets.
  - Data governance considerations for monitoring frameworks
    - Emphasizes the need for data quality assurance, metadata completeness, and standardized methods to enable trustworthy, comparable environmental health indicators.
    - Highlights challenges that monitoring bodies often face: data gaps, data access delays, organizational silos, the burden of sharing datasets publicly, keeping data up to date, and the need for robust data governance to store and update datasets.

- Relevance to policy monitoring and framework design (for the archetype)
  - Demonstrates a structured approach to measuring soil metal contamination around industrial sources, with explicit sampling design, standardized preparation, and validated analytical methods.
  - Provides a clear example of translating field data into usable indicators (metal concentrations by site) for environmental health monitoring and exposure assessment.
  - Illustrates practical data governance requirements (documentation, QA/QC, metadata, open data considerations) that monitoring frameworks should institutionalize to ensure data are fit for decision-making.
  - Highlights common hurdles in turning complex analytical results into clear, policy-relevant outputs (e.g., communicating spatial patterns, standardizing units/methods, and balancing data openness with privacy or proprietary considerations).

- Implications for future monitoring practice
  - Adopt standardized sampling grids and consistent depth/area sampling to enable temporal and spatial comparisons.
  - Ensure comprehensive metadata accompany datasets (method details, detection limits, QA/QC results, reference materials).
  - Use validated digestion and analytical methods (e.g., aqua regia digestion, ICP-MS/ICP-OES) with clear reporting of detection limits and recoveries.
  - Maintain transparent data governance, including data sharing practices and versioning, to support policy evaluation and future decision-making.
