# Outdoor and indoor cadmium distributions near an abandoned smelting works and their relations to human exposure

- Study aim
  - Investigates outdoor and indoor cadmium distributions near an abandoned smelting works and their relation to human exposure.

- Sampling design
  - Two soil sampling sets: grid-based nested approach.
  - 1 km grid within 5 km of the smelter; 5 km grid extending to 15 km from the site (westerly sampling limited by the Bristol Channel).
  - 44 locations sampled in October 2007.
  - At each site: five soil cores (15 cm deep × 4 cm) collected within a 10 m × 10 m area and pooled to form a homogeneous sample.
  - Sampling sites located on publicly accessible land with mixed grass/herbs where possible.

- Sample processing and analysis
  - Soils air-dried, roots/stones removed, homogenised; large debris removed via 2 mm mesh.
  - Sub-sampling by coning and quartering; milled with a non-metallic agate ball mill.
  - Total metal concentrations (Cd, Al, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, As, Pb, Hg) determined after aqua regia digestion (0.5 g soil in 12 ml aqua regia) and microwave digestion up to 200 °C.
  - Analysis performed on a Perkin Elmer Elan DRC II ICP-MS with matrix-matched calibrants; internal standards Ga, In, Re to correct drift.

- Analytical performance and quality control
  - Instrument detection limit for Cd: 0.02 μg g-1.
  - Quality control included a certified soil reference material (ISE 921) with each digestion batch.
  - Recoveries (compared to certified values): Cd 96.3%; Al 42.3%; Cr 78.0%; Cu 89.5%; Zn 85.7%; Ni 85.6%; As 104%; Pb 93.4%; Hg 109%.

- Additional soil properties
  - Soil organic matter content measured by furnace combustion at 375 °C (referencing Allen 1989).
  - Soil pH measured with a 1:2.5 soil:water suspension using a pH electrode (Allen 1989).

- Data and column definitions (AVONMOUTH.csv)
  - Site-level fields: site number, easting, northing, distance to smelter, site description.
  - Measurements: soil pH, Loss On Ignition (organic matter), and concentrations of Al, Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni, As, Cd, Hg, Pb in mg/kg.
  - Methods: gradual listing of measurement methods (e.g., ICP-OES for some elements; ICP-MS for others); includes notes on instruments (e.g., ICPMS, ICPOES).
  - Units and descriptions provided for each parameter (e.g., Cd in mg/kg; LOI as %; pH unitless).
