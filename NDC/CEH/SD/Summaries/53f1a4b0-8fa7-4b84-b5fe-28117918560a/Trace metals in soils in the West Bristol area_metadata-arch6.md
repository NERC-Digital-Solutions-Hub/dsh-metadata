# Outdoor and indoor cadmium distributions near an abandoned smelting works and their relations to human exposure.

- Data collection design
  - Two sets of soil samples: grid-based (nested) with a 1 km grid within 5 km of the smelter and a 5 km grid further out to 15 km; westerly sampling limited by Bristol Channel.
  - 44 locations sampled in October 2007.
  - Sites chosen on publicly accessible land with mixed vegetation where possible.

- Field sampling protocol
  - At each site: five soil cores (15 cm deep × 4 cm wide) within a 10 m × 10 m area.
  - Cores pooled to form a homogeneous sample for location.

- Data dictionary (AVONMOUTH.csv)
  - Variables include: site number, Easting/Northing (Ordnance Survey coordinates), site description, distance to smelter (km), soil pH, loss on ignition (organic matter %), and metal concentrations (Al, Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni, As, Cd, Hg, Pb) in mg/kg.
  - Methods and units: pH via electrode (soil:water 1:2.5), LOI by furnace at 375°C, metals analyzed by ICP-OES or ICP-MS as indicated (e.g., Cd by ICP-MS; Al by ICP-OES).
  - Notes on methods: ICP-MS and ICPOES abbreviations explained.

- Sample processing and preparation
  - Soil: air-dried, remove roots/stones, pass 2 mm sieve.
  - Sub-sampling: coning and quartering; milled with a non-metallic agate mill.
  - Aim: produce uniform samples suitable for digestions and instrumental analysis.

- Laboratory analysis and digestion
  - Digestion: total metals (including Cd, Al, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, As, Pb, Hg) by aqua regia using microwave digestion (0.5 g soil in 12 mL aqua regia) up to 200°C.
  - Instrumentation: PerkinElmer Elan DRC II ICP-MS; matrix-matched calibrants; internal standards Ga, In, Re to correct drift.

- Detection limits and quality control
  - Detection limits calculated as four times the SD of five blank replicates, accounting for sample weight and digestion volume (Cd LOD = 0.02 μg g⁻¹).
  - QA/QC: certified soil ISE 921 used with each batch; recoveries reported as Cd 96.3%, Al 42.3%, Cr 78.0%, Cu 89.5%, Zn 85.7%, Ni 85.6%, As 104%, Pb 93.4%, Hg 109%.

- Soil properties measurements
  - Soil organic matter: LOI via furnace combustion at 375°C.
  - Soil pH: measured with electrode on a 1:2.5 soil:water suspension.

- References and context
  - Analytical and sampling methods referenced from Allen (1989) for LOI and pH, Jones (1991) for monitoring methodology, and Spurgeon et al. (2008) for drivers of metal distribution in British soils.

- Data use and potential outputs (data support perspective)
  - Provides structured, quality-controlled data ready for spatial analysis, trend detection, and dashboard-style exploration of cadmium and other metal distributions around the smelting site.
  - Facilitates cross-comparison with prior monitoring programs and supports interpretation of metal association with soil properties (pH, organic matter).
