- Purpose: A short guide to visualising the Land Cover Class data in band 1 of UKCEH land cover rasters (2017–2020). Notes that rasters come in different resolutions with different band configurations (see details below) and directs readers to the product documentation for full data description.
- Data structure:
  - 20m and 10m rasters: two bands (Band 1 = UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier; Band 2 = classification confidence).
  - 25m rasters: three bands (Band 1 = dominant UKCEH Land Cover Class; Bands 2–3 = confidence indicators).
- Focus: Visualising the Land Cover Class information contained in Band 1 using common GIS applications.
- GIS applications covered:
  - QGIS
  - ArcGIS Desktop
  - ArcGIS Pro
- Visualisation steps in QGIS:
  - Add the file to the project; locate in layers panel.
  - Open layer properties and choose Symbology.
  - Set render type to Paletted/Unique Values and Band to Band 1.
