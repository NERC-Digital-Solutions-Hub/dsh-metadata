# The UKCEH Land Cover Maps for 2017, 2018 and 2019 v1.5.1

- Purpose and scope
  - Release of three new UKCEH Land Cover Maps: LCM2017, LCM2018 and LCM2019.
  - Each map includes 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats) and matches the structure used in LCM2015.
  - Maps produced automatically using Bootstrap Training plus Random Forest classifier; aim to enable annual releases going forward.
  - Product suite is duplicated for Great Britain and Northern Ireland for each year, resulting in 42 datasets total.

- Production approach and data lineage
  - Bootstrap Training
    - Automatic training data derived from historic UKCEH LCMs (primarily LCM2015, bootstrap from majority signal across years).
    - Selection: parcels with ≥99% purity used as training observations.
    - Goal: leverage large historical training signals to train current classifiers; plans to base future bootstraps on multi-year majority signals.
  - Random Forest classification
    - Balanced sampling: 10,000 samples per bag to ensure rare classes are well represented.
    - Software: bespoke production pipeline integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL.
  - Imagery and inputs
    - Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images (TOA reflectance) per season (winter, spring, summer, autumn) at 20 m resolution.
    - Context rasters (20 m) to reduce spectral confusion (terrain, proximity to buildings/roads/coast, etc.).
    - Four-season data and context layers used to create Classification Scenes.
  - Classification scenes and geography
    - Great Britain: 74 overlapping 100×100 km tiles used to create GB Classification Scenes (46-band per scene).
    - Northern Ireland: single 43-band Classification Scene per year for the entire NI extent.
    - Overlaps are classified independently; visual checks determine precedence.
  - Land Parcel Spatial Framework
    - Uses UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework unchanged in geometry, but with re-ordered storage and new indices for faster processing.
    - gid identifiers do not match LCM2015 parcels; comparisons should use gid rather than parcel-level overlap.
    - Land parcels have a minimum area ~0.5 ha (MMU) and are designed to represent discrete real-world units; parcels largely dominated by a single land cover class.
  - Data products and metadata
    - 20 m Classified Pixels, Land Parcels, 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels; plus 1 km Percent Cover, 1 km Percent Aggregate Cover, 1 km Dominant Cover, 1 km Dominant Aggregate Cover.
    - 42 datasets in total (GB and NI, for 2017, 2018, 2019).

- Data products and key metadata
  - 20 m Classified Pixels
    - 2-band raster: band 1 = most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class; band 2 = confidence (0–100) for the class.
    - Preserves fine detail by not generalising to parcels.
  - Land Parcels
    - Attributes changed from LCM2015: gid, _hist (histogram of pixel-class counts within parcel), _mode (modal class), _purity (percentage of modal class), _conf (mean class membership probability, 0–100), _stdev, _n (number of 20 m pixels in parcel).
    - Histogram representation updated to a tuple structure for readability.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels
    - 3-band raster: band 1 = modal class (_mode), band 2 = confidence (_conf), band 3 = purity (_purity).
  - 1 km rasters
    - 1 km Percent Cover: 21-band, 8-bit raster of per-class cover percentage.
    - 1 km Percent Aggregate Cover: 10-band, 8-bit raster of per-aggregate-class cover percentage.
    - 1 km Dominant Cover: single-band raster of the dominant class per 1 km grid.
    - 1 km Dominant Aggregate Cover: single-band raster for the dominant aggregate class per 1 km grid.
  - Extents and coordinate systems
    - Great Britain: GB British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).
    - Northern Ireland: Irish Grid (TM 75; EPSG: 29903).
  - Pixel and dataset details
    - 20 m Classified Pixels: 2-band rasters; per-year GB/NI datasets; 21 classes.
    - Land Parcels: attributes described above; slightly revised from LCM2015.
    - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels: 3 bands; 21 classes.
    - 1 km products: multi-band (Percent Cover: 21 bands; Percent Aggregate: 10 bands) plus 1-band Dominant products.
  - Validation and quality
    - Validation against GB countryside survey 2019, National Forest Inventory, IACS, and bespoke validation points (22,325 points).
    - Overall accuracy: LCM2017 = 78.6%, LCM2018 = 79.6%, LCM2019 = 79.4%.
    - Validation notes: cross-year currency differences; conversions between UKCEH classes and validation sources; full tables in Appendix 4.

- Considerations, limitations, and interpretation
  - No manual accuracy corrections in 2017–2019 run; classification errors are expected to be randomly distributed and reflect annual noise rather than persistent bias.
  - Temporal change detection: designed to reveal real land cover changes over time as the time series develops; persistent changes should stand out against background noise.
  - Certain classes (e.g., upland peatland vegetation, Bracken) have acknowledged spectral/Training data limitations; ongoing research aims to improve detection with more training data.
  - Saltwater vs Freshwater near coasts can be confused; coastal context rasters help but some misclassification remains.
  - BAP Broad Habitats vs UKCEH Land Cover Classes: relationships provided; some differences acknowledged due to detection limits from remote sensing vs field-based definitions.
  - The UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework is stable but not guaranteed to match LCM2015 parcel identifiers; gid-based comparisons are recommended for cross-year checks.

- Technical notes and appendices
  - Appendix 1: Notes on UKCEH Land Cover Classes (class definitions and detection considerations).
  - Appendix 2: Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats definitions.
  - Appendix 3: RGB color mapping for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes.
  - Appendix 4: Full validation tables and confusion matrices for LCM2017, LCM2018, LCM2019.
  - Appendix 5: Full list of datasets and digital holdings by year and region (GB/NI).
  - The document clarifies terminology, data lineage, and mapping between UKCEH and BAP classifications to aid interpretation and integration into data systems.

- Future plans and ongoing development
  - Annual LCM releases planned; LCM2020 targeted for 2021 release.
  - Ongoing assessment of input data (e.g., exploring Sentinel-1 SAR and alternative inputs to fill seasonal gaps).
  - Continued refinement of Bootstrap Training and classification approaches; expectations of improved validations as methods mature.
  - Aims to maintain continuity with historical maps while enabling newer detection capabilities and facilitating time-series analysis.
