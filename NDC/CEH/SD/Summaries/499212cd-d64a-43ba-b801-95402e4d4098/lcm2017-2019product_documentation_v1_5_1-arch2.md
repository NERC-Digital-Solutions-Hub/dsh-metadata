# The UKCEH Land Cover Maps for 2017, 2018 and 2019

## Aim and scope
- Presents three new UKCEH Land Cover Maps (LCM2017, LCM2018, LCM2019) covering Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
- Maps 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes based on Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats; designed for remote sensing with a focus on consistency across time for change detection.
- Production is automatic, with no manual corrections in this release; aims for annual updates going forward.
- Provides guidance on data production, validation, decisions behind methods, and planned future enhancements.

## Data production approach
- Automatic classification using Bootstrap Training + Random Forest (RF) with balanced sampling.
- Bootstrap Training derives training data from historic UKCEH maps (primarily LCM2015) to sample spectral information for current Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images (TOA reflectance) per season (winter, spring, summer, autumn).
- Each year’s map is generated from 36-band Seasonal Composite Images plus 20m Context Rasters to form Classification Scenes; GB uses multiple 100x100 km tiles (74 Scenes total), NI uses a single large tile.
- Visual checks and formal validation performed; no manual corrections were applied to preserve annual map production speed.

## Dataset structure and products
- The dataset suite mirrors LCM2015 but with an additional dataset and updated metadata; for each year there are:
  - 20m Classified Pixels (new): per-pixel RF classification with two bands (class and confidence 0–100); preserves detailed features by not generalising to parcels.
  - Land Parcels: results from intersecting 20m Classified Pixels with UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework; includes parcel-level attributes such as gid, hist, mode, purity, conf, stdev, n.
  - 25m Rasterised Land Parcels: summaries of Land Parcels with three bands (mode, conf, purity).
  - 1km Raster Datasets: 
    - 1km Percent Cover (21 bands),
    - 1km Percent Aggregate Cover (10 bands),
    - 1km Dominant Cover (1 band),
    - 1km Dominant Aggregate Cover (1 band).
- Each year provides Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI) versions, totaling 42 datasets across years.
- Dataset specifics:
  - Pixel sizes: Classified Pixels 20 m; Land Parcels geometry ~0.5 ha minimum (minimum mappable unit, MMU); 25m rasters; 1km grids for summary products.
  - Coordinate systems: GB – British National Grid (EPSG:27700); NI – Irish Grid (EPSG:29903).
- Classes: 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes; maps align with LCM2015 classes and UK BAP Broad Habitats, with careful distinctions explained in appendices.

## Inputs and classification components
- Seasonal Composite Images: Sentinel-2 data generated by Google Earth Engine; TOA reflectance, resampled to 20 m; four-season composites; some seasonal gaps due to cloud are tolerated by the RF classifier.
- Context Rasters (20 m): include terrain (Height, Aspect, Slope), proximity measures (distance to buildings, roads, sea, freshwater), foreshore, tidal masks, and land-cover-related masks (e.g., woodland).
- Classification Scenes: GB classified in overlapping 100x100 km tiles (36-band scenes combined with 10 context layers to form 46-band inputs); NI uses a single 43-band scene (36 spectral + 7 context layers).

## Land Parcel framework and data structure
- UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework: unchanged geometry since LCM2015 but with reordering of storage and new indices to speed processing; gid identifiers differ from LCM2015; cross-year parcel comparisons require using gid within LCM2017–LCM2019.
- Land Parcel attributes (Table changes): attributes (_hist, _mode, _purity, _conf, _stdev, _n) updated to align with production software; some naming differences from LCM2015 explained in the guide.
- The Land Parcel framework supports fixed parcel units for change detection, while the 20m Classified Pixels can be summarised by alternative parcel boundaries if desired.

## Validation and accuracy
- Validation performed against GB countryside survey 2019 data, National Forest Inventory, IACS data, and bespoke LCM validation points (n ≈ 22,325); results indicate:
  - LCM2017: ~78.6% overall accuracy
  - LCM2018: ~79.6% overall accuracy
  - LCM2019: ~79.4% overall accuracy
- Note: The same validation dataset was used across all three products, so “currency” relative to each product varies; conversions to UKCEH classes involved some subjectivity. The reported ~80% correspondence is considered a strong baseline with scope for improvement as methods mature.
- Appendices provide detailed confusion matrices, producer’s and user’s accuracy metrics by class.

## Usage considerations and future plans
- Automatic classification without manual corrections limits year-by-year adjustments but enables rapid annual updates; validation indicates reasonable accuracy for broad monitoring purposes.
- The dataset is designed to support monitoring of environmental change over time and can be integrated with other spatial datasets for enhanced analyses; Bootstrap Training from historic maps enables scalable training without new field campaigns.
- Future enhancements anticipated: expansion of input data sources (e.g., broader use of Sentinel-1 SAR), improved gap-filling for seasonal data, refined training datasets, potential updates to the Land Parcel Spatial Framework to align with finer-resolution data, and continued evaluation for higher thematic detail.
- The annual release approach is intended to support ongoing assessment of land cover change and policy-relevant monitoring.

## Plan and governance notes for analysts monitoring the environment
- Data are structured to support time-series analyses of land cover change in a consistent framework.
- Outputs are designed for clear presentation (pixels, parcels, and 1km summaries) to facilitate policy performance assessments and environmental health monitoring.
- Emphasis on data quality assurance, standardised processing, and transparent note on limitations and future improvements.
