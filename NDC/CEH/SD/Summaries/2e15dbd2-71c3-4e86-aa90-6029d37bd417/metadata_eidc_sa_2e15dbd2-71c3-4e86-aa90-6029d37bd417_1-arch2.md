# Parma2009_LandslideInventory_UTM_JJReviewed

## Overview
- Dataset of landslide polygons mapped from evidence before and after a typhoon, created by two contributors.
- Analysis period for the work: August–October 2020.
- Mapping relied on high- to very high-resolution satellite imagery to capture landslide extents within Oct 2019–Mar 2020.

## Data collection and methods
- Polygons mapped by visual observation of change indicative of landslides.
- Measurements and geographic features recorded in a Geographic Information System (GIS) using the inventory plus other GIS layers (e.g., Digital Elevation Model, Geology map).

## Temporal and spatial coverage
- Imagery used for mapping: 0.5 m to 10 m resolution.
- Time window for imagery: Oct 2019 to Mar 2020.
- Mapped polygons: 2040 individual landslide polygons.
- Polygon areas range from 6 to 40,000 m².
- Coordinate reference system: WGS 1984 UTM Zone 51N (shapefile components include .prj and .qpj).

## Data structure and files
- Main dataset stored as a single shapefile package:
  - Parma2009_LandslideInventory_UTM_JJReviewed.shp (geometry and primary attributes)
  - Parma2009_LandslideInventory_UTM_JJReviewed.dbf (attribute data)
  - Parma2009_LandslideInventory_UTM_JJReviewed.cpg (UTF-8 encoding)
  - Parma2009_LandslideInventory_UTM_JJReviewed.prj (projection)
  - Parma2009_LandslideInventory_UTM_JJReviewed.qpj (additional projection info)
  - Parma2009_LandslideInventory_UTM_JJReviewed.shx (shape index)
  - Parma2009_LandslideInventory_UTM_JJReviewed.xml (changes/updates metadata)
- Structure supports map-based analysis and integration with other GIS datasets.

## Quality control
- Inventory validated by two reviewers to ensure accuracy of polygon delineation and attribute data.

## Documentation and data availability
- No SOPs for specific techniques or methods are provided in the dataset metadata.
- Sample storage/treatment information is not applicable (N/A) in this dataset context.
- Data is organized for standard GIS usage and potential combination with other environmental datasets to enhance value and accessibility.
