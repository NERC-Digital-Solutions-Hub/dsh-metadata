# Multiple social encounters can eliminate Crozier's paradox and stabilise genetic kin recognition

## Overview
- Supplemental code accompanying the Nature Communications 2022 paper by Scott, Grafen & West.
- Implemented in MATLAB R2019a.
- Purpose: generate data for three modelling approaches to study stabilisation of genetic kin recognition under different selection regimes.

## Data generation scripts and their focus
- Generate_data_for_island_model_weak_selection: produces data for the weak-selection mathematical island model.
- Generate_data_for_agent_based_simulation: produces data for an agent-based simulation accounting for stronger selection and finite population sizes.
- Generate_data_for_balancing_selection_finite_pop: produces data for the agent-based model without tag mutation, examining balancing selection via tag fixation times.

## Reproducibility and accessibility
- Provides reproducible data-generation workflows for comparative analysis across modelling approaches.
- MATLAB-based workflow specifying the environment (MATLAB R2019a).
