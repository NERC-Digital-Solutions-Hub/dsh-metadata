# Multiple social encounters can eliminate Crozier's paradox and stabilise genetic kin recognition

## Overview
- Supplemental code for the Nature Communications 2022 paper by Scott, Grafen & West.
- Purpose: generate data for multiple modeling approaches to study how social encounters influence Crozier's paradox and kin recognition.
- Implemented in MATLAB R2019a.

## What the code covers
- Generate_data_for_island_model_weak_selection: data generation for the weak-selection mathematical island-model framework.
- Generate_data_for_agent_based_simulation: data generation for an agent-based simulation model incorporating stronger selection and finite populations.
- Generate_data_for_balancing_selection_finite_pop: data generation for a variant of the agent-based model without tag mutation, examining balancing selection via tag fixation times.

## Intended use
- Reproduce results from the study and explore parameter spaces across different modeling approaches.
- Produce datasets for analysis of correlations, patterns, and predictive relationships related to social encounters, selection strength, and kin recognition dynamics.
