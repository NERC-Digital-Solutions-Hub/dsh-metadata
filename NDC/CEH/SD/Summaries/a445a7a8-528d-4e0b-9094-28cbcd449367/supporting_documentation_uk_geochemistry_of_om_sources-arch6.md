# Supporting documentation for data resource UK_geochemistry_of_OM_sources.csv

- Purpose of the data resource: Provide bulk elemental (organic carbon and nitrogen) and stable isotope (δ13C_org and δ15N) data to help constrain organic carbon sources (terrestrial vs marine) in UK environments using isotope mixing models.
- Scope and samples: 491 samples collected across the United Kingdom from terrestrial, intertidal, and marine environments between 2016 and 2021.
  - Terrestrial: soil, peat, living biomass, dead biomass
  - Intertidal: saltmarsh vegetation, saltmarsh roots, seagrass biomass, mudflat, faecal matter
  - Marine: macroalgae, microalgae, zooplankton, finfish aquaculture waste
- Variables observed: δ13C_org (‰), δ15N (‰), OC_content (%), N_content (%), C/N ratio, N/C ratio.
- Location and coverage: UK-wide observations with geographic coordinates provided (examples include 60.9735, -8.0192; 60.9735, 2.1761; 49.8440, -8.0192; 49.8440, 2.1761). Location descriptions indicate sampling across coastal catchments to capture diverse organic matter sources.
- Sample handling and preparation: 
  - Storage at -20°C
  - Oven drying at 40°C for 72 hours, then milled to a fine powder
- Analytical methods:
  - Isotopic and elemental analysis performed on approximately 12 mg processed sediment in tin capsules; an additional 12 mg in silver capsules for carbonate removal via acid fumigation
  - Stable isotope and elemental analyses conducted using an elemental analyser coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS) at the James Hutton Institute
  - δ13C_org and OC values from acidified samples; δ15N and N from tin-encapsulated samples
- Quality assurance and calibration:
  - Isotopic values quality controlled via repeated analysis of a high OC sediment standard (B2151) with reference values for C and N
  - Laboratory equipment calibrated following University of St Andrews practices
- Data formats and checks:
  - Primary data format: CSV
  - Data checking indicators noted as NA where not applicable

- Practical use notes:
  - Data intended to support isotope-based partitioning of organic matter sources in UK ecosystems
  - Suitable for integration with isotope mixing models and related environmental datasets
  - Metadata provides context for sampling design, sample classes, and national classifications to aid data discovery and re-use
