# Live-trapping surveys of small mammals on arable field margins on the Hillesden estate in Buckinghamshire (England) during 2005-2011

- Purpose and context
  - Assess small mammal populations in response to three farmland management types over 2005–2011.
  - Part of a larger experiment evaluating Environmental Stewardship options.

- Experimental design
  - Location: Hillesden farming estate, Buckinghamshire (1000 ha), with hedgerows and ditch networks.
  - Treatments (in five replicate blocks, 43–70 ha each):
    - Cross Compliance (CC): control; 1–2 m wide margins along field boundaries; hedgerows cut annually.
    - Entry Level Scheme (ELS): ~1% of land converted to 6-m-wide margins with a simple grass mix; one field patch sown for granivores; hedgerows cut biennially.
    - Entry Level Scheme Extra (ELSX): ~5% converted to 6-m-wide margins with grasses and wildflowers; multiple field patches sown for birds and wildflowers; hedgerows cut biennially.
  - Margins sampled differed by regime:
    - CC: 1–2 m wide margins.
    - ELS/ELSX: 6-m-wide margins with enhanced habitat.

- Survey methods
  - Sampling periods: autumn (Nov–Dec) 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010; and spring (May) following each autumn.
  - Trapping setup: two 100-m trap lines per replicate per season; 11 Longworth traps per line (22 traps per replicate); traps placed 1–2 m from field boundary (CC) or within 6-m margins (ELS/ELSX).
  - Pre-baiting and trapping protocol: four nights pre-baiting; baited with wheat, carrot, and blowfly pupae; monitored for three nights.
  - Marking: individuals marked with PIT tags (autumn) or fur clips (spring); records include species, sex, weight, and reproductive status.
  - Data scope: 3172 trapping records across 1881 individuals; most records are captures or recaptures, with some trap activations without captures.

- Data structure and metadata
  - Core fields include: Year, Season, Date, Trap_Check_Time, Farming_Regime, Habitat, Sampling_Block, Location, Coordinates, Trap_Number, Capture_Type, Species (English and Scientific), Sex, Body_Condition, Weight_g, Notes.
  - Data captured via standardized protocol; some records missing or flagged as No_data after cleaning.
  - Data management included quality control steps and record cleaning to remove errors.

- Key findings relevant to data interpretation
  - Trapping efficiency was high (capture rates >70% of traps) in only a minority of sessions (autumn 9%, spring 7%), suggesting captures closely reflected population dynamics rather than trap bias.
  - No significant difference in hedgerow resources (e.g., berry production) between treatments, and hedgerow length within a 50 m buffer did not differ across treatments.
  - Habitat treatments varied in margin width and management, but these did not straightforwardly translate into measurable hedgerow-based differences in small mammal capture rates within the study period.

- Data quality, governance, and reuse
  - Records were cleaned and standardized; missing values are flagged as No_data.
  - The dataset supports longitudinal analysis across years, seasons, and management regimes, with explicit linkage between trap locations, habitat types, and replicates.
  - Appendix and references provide context on trap interference and data collection methods; data integrity benefits from cross-referencing with methodological guides.

- Appendix highlight: corvid interference with Longworth traps
  - Disturbance by corvids (Carrion Crows, Magpies) increasingly affected traps from 2008 onward, sometimes displacing or disassembling traps and removing bait.
  - Interference occurred across transects, often in daylight, complicating monitoring efforts and necessitating consideration in data interpretation and future study design.

- References and data provenance
  - Key sources detailing methods and related analyses include Gurnell & Flowerdew (2006) for trapping protocol, and related Hillesden experiment publications and reports that contextualize habitat management and biodiversity outcomes.
