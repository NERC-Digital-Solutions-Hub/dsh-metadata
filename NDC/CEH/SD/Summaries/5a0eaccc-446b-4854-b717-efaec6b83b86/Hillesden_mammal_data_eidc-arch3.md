# Live-trapping surveys of small mammals on arable field margins on the Hillesden estate in Buckinghamshire (England) during 2005-2011

## Introduction
- Objective: sample small mammal populations to assess responses to habitat management types; part of a wider randomised block experiment evaluating Environmental Stewardship options established in 2005.
- Location and context: 1000 ha Hillesden farming estate, central England; lowland intensive arable farming with hedgerows and grassy margins.
- Treatments investigated:
  - Cross Compliance (CC): control; 2 m wide field margins from hedgerows or 1 m from ditch tops; hedgerows cut annually.
  - Entry Level Scheme (ELS): typical regional management; ~6 m margins sown with grass; a small food-resource patch for granivorous birds; hedgerows cut biennially.
  - Entry Level Scheme Extra (ELSX): larger, more diverse habitat; ~6 m margins with grasses and wildflowers; multiple seed and wildflower patches; hedgerows cut biennially.
- Key aim: determine how habitat management influences small mammal abundance and diversity on farmland margins.

## Survey design and methods
- Sampling framework: autumn (Nov–Dec) 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010; spring (May) in the following seasons.
- Experimental layout: five replicate blocks; each contains CC, ELS, and ELSX margin treatments.
- Trapping design: two 100-m trap lines per replicate, 11 Longworth traps per line (22 traps per replicate per season), positioned 1–2 m from the boundary; traps spaced 10 m apart.
- Trapping protocol: pre-bait with wheat for four nights, then bait with wheat, carrot, and blowfly pupae; traps checked morning and evening over three trapping nights.
- Marking and identification: autumn captures tagged with PIT tags or fur clips; species, weight, sex, and breeding condition recorded; captures and recaptures tracked with unique identifiers.
- Data scope and logistics: captures reflect mammal populations rather than trap-limitation given high trap engagement in most sessions.
  
## Data structure and quality control
- Dataset size and content: 3172 trapping records representing at least 1881 individual animals; includes captures, recaptures, and trap-activation events.
- Key data fields: year, season, date, habitat type, sampling block, location, coordinates, trap number, capture type, species (English and scientific names), sex, body condition, weight, notes, and tagging information (PIT codes).
- Quality control: records cleaned to remove errors; missing values logged as No_data; data structured to support analyses of treatment effects and spatial-temporal patterns.

## Corvid interference with Longworth traps (Appendix)
- Issue observed: interference by Carrion Crows and possibly Magpies with traps, beginning around 2008 and increasing by 2010–2011.
- Extent and pattern: 33% of transects disturbed; 20% of monitoring visits affected; 6% of traps involved; disturbances commonly occurred during midday.
- Suspected causes: corvids attracted to bait and possibly preying on captured individuals; other predators (foxes, badgers) less supported by evidence in daylight.
- Mitigation attempts: practical measures (pinning traps, partial burial, litter covers) offered limited success.
- Implications for monitoring: wildlife interference can bias trap-based monitoring; highlights need for robust design considerations and potential alternative methods in monitoring frameworks.

## Key results and interpretations
- Hedgerows and resources: no clear difference in berry production or hedgerow length around sampling sites between treatments; hedgerows not identified as a primary driver of mammal numbers in this setup.
- Habitat development: margins under ELS/ELSX were established and allowed to develop, with limited cutting after initial establishment to support habitat complexity.
- Data-scale implications: the dataset supports farm-scale evaluation of habitat-management effects on small mammal communities, though wildlife interference introduces data-quality considerations.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Study design relevance: demonstrates a farm-scale, randomized block approach to test environmental stewardship options and habitat-management policies.
- Data governance and metadata: emphasizes comprehensive data structures and quality control to enable reproducibility and robust policy assessment.
- Real-world data challenges: highlights practical barriers common to monitoring frameworks, including data gaps, access, metadata adequacy, data transformation needs, and governance; and illustrates how wildlife behaviour can affect data integrity.
- Stakeholder awareness and transparency: Appendix example underscores the importance of documenting anomalies and disturbances to inform interpretation and governance of monitoring outputs.
