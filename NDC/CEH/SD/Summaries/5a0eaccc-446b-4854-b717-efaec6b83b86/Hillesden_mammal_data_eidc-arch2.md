# Live-trapping surveys of small mammals on arable field margins on the Hillesden estate in Buckinghamshire (England) during 2005-2011

## Objective and Study Context
- Assess small-mammal populations in spring and autumn in grassy field margins under three management types to evaluate habitat-management effects.
- Part of a wider randomised block experiment to test Environmental Stewardship options (2005), with five replicates of three treatments.
- Treatments:
  - Cross Compliance (CC): control, uncultivated 2 m field margins from hedge center or 1 m from ditch top; hedgerows cut annually after summer harvest.
  - Entry Level Scheme (ELS): ~1% of cultivated land converted to 6 m field margins with a simple grass mix; a food-resource patch for granivorous birds; hedgerows cut biennially.
  - Entry Level Scheme Extra (ELSX): ~5% converted to 6 m margins with grasses and wildflowers; three 0.5 ha patches sown with wild bird seed mixes; three patches managed for perennial wildflowers; hedgerows cut biennially.
- Landscape context: Hillesden estate ~1000 ha, lowland intensive arable farming with hedgerows and ditches; margins intended to influence small mammals, invertebrates, birds.

## Treatments and Habitat Management Details
- Margin management differed: CC margins roughly cut annually; ELS/ELSX margins mown in year of installation only, then left to develop grassy habitat.
- Hedge network and resource availability (e.g., berry production) did not differ notably between CC and ELS/ELSX, suggesting hedgerows were not the primary driver of small-mammal numbers in this study.
- GIS analysis indicated no difference in hedgerow length within 50 m of sampling sites across treatments.

## Survey Design and Methods
- Sampling periods: autumn (November–December) in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010; spring (May) following each autumn survey.
- Trapping setup:
  - Each replicate block contained ELS, ELSX, and CC areas.
  - Two 100 m trap lines per replicate, with 11 Longworth traps per line (22 traps per replicate per session), spaced 10 m apart.
  - Traps pre-baited with wheat for four nights; baited with wheat, carrot, and blowfly pupae; set for three nights; checked morning and evening.
  - Sampling within a three-week window each season.
- Marking and identification:
  - Autumn captures: species, mass (to 0.5 g), sex, breeding condition.
  - PIT tagging (12 mm) for wood mice, bank voles, field voles at first autumn capture; other captures marked with fur clips (used for recaptures in subsequent seasons).
- Data collection scope:
  - 3172 trapping records representing at least 1881 individual animals.
  - Includes captures, recaptures, and instances where traps were triggered without captures.
- Data management:
  - Standardized record fields (year, season, date, farming regime, habitat type, sampling block, location coordinates, trap number, capture type, species, sex, body condition, weight, notes).
  - Quality control included record cleaning; missing values labeled as No_data.
- Preliminary assessment of trap efficacy:
  - Trap-limited captures were rare: only 9% of autumn sessions and 7% of spring sessions had >70% trap occupancy, indicating traps generally reflected underlying populations rather than being a limiting factor.

## Data Collected and Structure
- Dataset composition:
  - Records include captures, recaptures, and non-capture trap activations.
  - Detailed metadata per record: year, season, date, time of capture, farming regime, habitat, replicate block, location, trap details, marking method, species, sex, reproductive status, weight, and notes.
- Scale and replication:
  - Five replicate blocks with ELS, ELSX, and CC areas within each block.
  - Margin types and management regimes consistently applied within replicates.
- Output potential:
  - Data suitable for assessing how different agri-environment schemes affect small-mammal diversity and abundance at the farm scale (as elaborated in related analyses).

## Quality Control and Data Integrity
- Records were checked and cleaned to remove errors; missing values are recorded as No_data.
- The dataset emphasizes standardized data collection and tagging to enable reliable recapture analyses and cross-season comparisons.

## Preliminary Observations and Related Analyses
- The Hillesden experiment has contributed to broader findings on biodiversity responses to agri-environment schemes:
  - Evidence (from related publications) that environmental stewardship options can influence small mammal diversity and abundance at the farm scale.
  - Hedgerow structure alone did not explain differences in small mammal numbers within this study, highlighting habitat patches and management regimes as more influential factors.

## Appendix: Corvids Exploiting Longworth Traps
- Context: During 2005–2011 trapping, Carrion Crows and Magpies were observed disrupting Longworth traps, potentially biasing monitoring results.
- Interference details:
  - 10 transects (33%) experienced trap disturbance across the study, affecting 20% of monitoring visits and 6% of traps.
  - Interference increased in 2010; incidents often occurred mid-day.
  - Suspected culprits included corvids based on field signs (footprints, down feathers, scratch marks) and timing; distant proximity to hedgerows and observed birds supported this.
  - Badger/fox predation suspected initially but not supported by field signs or timing.
- Mitigation attempts:
  - Pinning traps, partial burying, or covering with litter provided limited success.
- Conclusion:
  - Corvids likely caused most trap interference, potentially biasing small-mammal monitoring data in affected transects.
  - The observation highlights the importance of considering wildlife behavior and potential data collection biases when interpreting long-term monitoring datasets.

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring and Policy Evaluation
- Demonstrates the utility of standardized, transparent data collection and robust marking/recapture data for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Illustrates challenges in data value enhancement and data accessibility:
  - While collected for farm-scale policy evaluation, the dataset benefits from integration with other environmental datasets and broader accessibility for secondary analyses.
- Confirms the need for documenting data provenance, quality control steps, and potential biases (e.g., trap interference) to ensure credible policy-relevant insights.
