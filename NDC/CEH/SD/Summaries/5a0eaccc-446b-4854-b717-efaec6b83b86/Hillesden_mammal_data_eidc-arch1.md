# Live-trapping surveys of small mammals on arable field margins on the Hillesden estate in Buckinghamshire (England) during 2005-2011

## Overview
- Study location: Hillesden farming estate, Buckinghamshire, central England (1000 ha; lowland intensively-farmed arable fields with hedgerows and ditches).
- Objective: assess small-mammal populations in response to habitat-management types within an environmental stewardship experiment.
- Timeframe: surveys conducted in autumn (Nov–Dec) 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010 and in spring (May) of subsequent years; part of a wider randomised block experiment (2005 onward).

## Experimental design and treatments
- Replicates: five blocks, each containing three farming regimes.
- Treatments:
  - Cross Compliance (CC): control; uncultivated field margins 2 m wide from hedgerow center or 1 m from ditch top; hedgerows cut annually after harvest.
  - Entry Level Scheme (ELS): ~6 m wide margins; one 0.25 ha patch of food/resource options; hedgerows cut biennially.
  - Entry Level Scheme Extra (ELSX): larger area with diverse habitats; ~5% cultivated land converted to 6 m margins with grasses and wildflowers; multiple patches of seed mixes or wildflower management; hedgerows cut biennially.
- Margins:
  - CC margins: 1–2 m wide and regularly maintained.
  - ELS/ELSX margins: 6 m wide; habitat development allowed after initial weed suppression.

## Survey methods
- Trapping setup:
  - Two 100 m trap lines per replicate (between 95 and 667 m apart), parallel to field boundaries.
  - Each line: 11 Longworth traps (22 traps per replicate per season), spaced 10 m apart.
  - Pre-baited with wheat for four nights; baited with wheat, carrot, and blowfly pupae; traps checked morning and evening over three nights.
- Sampling periods:
  - Autumn: five trapping sessions across a three-week window each season.
  - Spring: five trapping sessions in following May.
- Marking and identification:
  - Autumn: first capture recorded; individuals marked with PIT tags (12 mm) for recapture; other captures marked with fur clips.
  - Species, mass (to 0.5 g), sex, and breeding condition recorded.
- Data coverage and limitations:
  - Preliminary data indicated trapping was not bottlenecked (capture rates exceeded ~70% of traps only on a minority of sessions), so captures broadly reflect populations.
- Focal species:
  - Wood mice, bank voles, field voles (and others recorded).

## Data collected and structure
- Dataset size: 3,172 trapping records; at least 1,881 individual animals captured or recaptured.
- Record types: captures, recaptures, and trap activations without captures.

  - Year, Season, Date, Trap_Check_Time
  - Farming_Regime (CC, ELS, ELSX)
  - Habitat (margin type: 6 m ELS/ELSX vs 1–2 m CC)
  - Sampling_Block (1–5)
  - Location (field names), coordinates (x/y)

  - Notes
- Data quality: records cleaned and errors removed; missing values recorded as No_data.

## Findings relevant to data interpretation
- Hedgerows and berry resources:
  - Differences in hedgerow-cutting regimes (CC vs ELS/ELSX) did not translate into differences in berry production.
  - No difference in hedgerow length within a 50 m buffer around sampling sites across treatments.
  - Conclusion: hedgerows were not major drivers of small-mammal numbers in this setup.
- Implications for analyses:
  - When modelling abundance or occupancy, consider habitat regime and margin width, but hedgerow quantity alone may not explain variation observed.
  - The dataset supports comparisons of small-mammal populations across management treatments, with recognition of potential confounding by habitat features beyond hedgerows.
- Data provenance and linkage:
  - Linked to broader Hillesden experiments on agri-environment schemes; primary analyses previously reported (e.g., Hillesden-related papers).

## Corvid interference (Appendix)
- Corvids (Carrion Crows, Magpies) were observed distorting Longworth traps.
- Interference emerged more clearly from 2008 onward and intensified in 2010.
- Interference patterns:
  - Ten transects affected (≈33%), influencing ~20% of monitoring visits and 6% of traps.
  - Disturbances occurred mostly during the daytime; some may have involved multiple individuals.
  - Evidence pointed to corvids as the primary disruptors (footprints, feathers, scratch marks); badgers/foxes less likely given timing.
- Mitigation attempts:
  - Pinning traps, burying/trapping coverage, or covering with litter provided limited success.
- Implications for data quality:
  - Corvid interference could bias capture rates; accounting for this source of disturbance is important when interpreting temporal or spatial results from trapping data.
