# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Summary for Data Leaders
- LCM2007 is provided in two primary data formats to meet diverse user needs: vector data (detailed parcel-level land cover with metadata) and raster data (summary rasters for broader analyses).
- Vector data supports precise mapping with polygons representing land parcels, including attributes for land cover and metadata on derivation; minimum mapable unit is 0.5 hectares; supplied as ESRI Shapefile; coverage is the United Kingdom (UK).
- Raster data offers five products. A 25 x 25 m raster gives the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel; four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarize the 25 x 25 m data; detailed metadata is available in the dataset documentation; scales available are 25 m and 1 km; supplied as GeoTiff; coverage UK.
- Additional information is provided in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation, including:
  - Table 1: attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes
  - Table 3: metadata information for the raster datasets

## Relevance for Data Leaders

- Supports decision-making on data strategy by outlining available formats, granularity, and metadata quality.
- Enables assessment of data suitability, discoverability, and potential gaps (e.g., need for higher granularity or alternative formats for specific analyses).
- Facilitates planning for data integration across platforms and user needs by providing both detailed (vector) and summary (raster) representations.
