# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- UK-wide land cover information provided in both vector and raster formats to support standardized environmental monitoring and analysis.

## Data formats and scales
- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata about derivation.
  - Minimum mapping unit: 0.5 ha.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: United Kingdom.
- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total.
  - 25 x 25 m raster: provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters: summarise the 25 x 25 m raster.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
  - Supply format: GeoTiff.
  - Coverage: United Kingdom.

## Documentation and metadata
- Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Tables include:
  - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes for LCM2007.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

## Practical use for analysts
- Choose format based on resolution needs: high-detail vector vs. scalable rasters for broad habitat analyses.
- Outputs suitable for GIS workflows, standardised reporting, maps, and charts.
- Datasets can be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for sharing and reuse.

## Accessibility and reuse
- Formats include ESRI Shapefile and GeoTiff, with both high-resolution and summary raster products available for UK coverage.
