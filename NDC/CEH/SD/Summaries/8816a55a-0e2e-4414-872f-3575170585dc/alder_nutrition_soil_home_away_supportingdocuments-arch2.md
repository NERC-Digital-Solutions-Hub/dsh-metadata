# Plant biomass, nutrition, ecosystem carbon fluxes and soil nutrients in common alder growing on home and away soil from Aberdeenshire, Scotland. 2018

## Aim and scope
- Investigates how soil origin (home alder soil, birch family soil, and Douglas fir away soil) and associated symbionts influence alder seedling growth and nutrition.
- Uses a 13C pulse-labelling approach to track allocation of recent photosynthate to fine roots and symbiotic partners (ECM fungi and Frankia), and relates this to belowground carbon flux and nutrient uptake.
- Tests predictions that home soils yield better seedling performance due to specialist symbionts and that seedling leaf N and P contents are linked to nodulation and mycorrhizal associations.

## Study design and setting
- Location: Crathes Estate, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.
- Soil sampling: intact cores from under three stands (alder, birch, Douglas fir); 10 cores per stand (30 total).
- Mesocosm setup: controlled environment chamber (20°C, 14 h light); root-excluding soil cores to differentiate root and microbial contributions.
- Seedlings: one non-mycorrhizal alder seedling per mesocosm; 10 mesocosms per soil origin; growth period ~6 months.
- Timeframe: harvest after 6 months; multiple sampling points around labelling.

## Methods and measurements
- Isotope labelling: 13C-enriched CO2 pulse for 6 hours; leaf samples collected before, immediately after, and every 12 hours up to 48 hours post-labelling; additional measurement of 13C in NaOH traps for microbial activity.
- Whole-system carbon flux: CO2 exchange measured under light/dark conditions; net ecosystem carbon balance derived from flux data.
- Plant and tissue measurements: biomass components (shoots, roots, coarse/lateral/fine roots), specific leaf area (SLA); leaf N and P analysis.
- Symbiosis assessment: ectomycorrhizal (ECM) colonization percentage; nodulation in Frankia; representative morphotypes analyzed; fungal DNA extracted for sequencing (ITS region) to identify ECM taxa.
- Soil nutrient pools: total and exchangeable C, N, P; in situ ion exchange membrane probes for surrounding nutrient supply; macro- and micro-nutrient concentrations (K, Ca, Mg, NO3-, NH4+, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, S, Pb, Al); pH measured.
- Data capture: leaf and root tissues analysed for 13C/12C ratios; 15N natural abundance subset analysed by CF-IRMS.

## Data structure and units
- Data organized as columns; rows correspond to individual replicate cores.
- Soil origin variable codes: Ag = Alnus glutinosa, Bp = Betula pendula, Pm = Pseudotsuga menziesii.
- Key units include:
  - Biomass and tissue weights: mg dry weight
  - Carbon flux: mg CO2 m-2 h-1
  - 13C measurements: atom% or per mil (d13C) in leaves, fine roots, Frankia, NaOH traps
  - Nutrients: leaf N, leaf P (percent); soil C, N, P (percent); NO3-, NH4+, K, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, S, Pb, Al (µg per 10 cm2 per 21 days)
  - ECM colonization: percent
  - Nodules: count/seedling
  - SLA: specific leaf area
- Fungal identifications linked to ECM taxa via ITS sequencing (GenBank deposit for representative sequences).

## Analytical approach and data quality
- Standardised collection and lab protocols across soil origins to enable comparability.
- Integration of physiological, isotopic, and molecular data to interpret plant–soil–microbial interactions.
- Data suitable for longitudinal and cross-site environmental monitoring, with potential for integration with other datasets to assess plant–soil feedbacks and ecosystem carbon/nutrient dynamics.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Demonstrates a rigorous, standardised workflow for linking soil origin and symbiotic communities to plant performance and carbon/nutrient fluxes.
- Produces multi-dimensional datasets (growth, nutrient status, carbon allocation, microbial activity, and ECM composition) suitable for monitoring ecosystem health and informing policy on forest nutrient cycling and soil–plant interactions.
- Highlights the importance of accessible underlying data and associated metadata to support broader analyses and data sharing.
