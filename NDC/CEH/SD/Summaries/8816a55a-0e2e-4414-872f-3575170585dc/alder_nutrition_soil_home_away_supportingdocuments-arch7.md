# Plant biomass, nutrition, ecosystem carbon fluxes and soil nutrients in common alder growing on home and away soil from Aberdeenshire, Scotland. 2018

## Objective
- Examine how soil origin (home alder, family birch, away Douglas fir) and associated symbiotic partners shape alder seedling performance.
- Investigate relationships between seedling nutritional status and allocation of recent photosynthate (13C) belowground to fine roots and symbionts (Frankia nodules and ectomycorrhizal fungi).

## Study design and setting
- Location: Crathes Estate, Aberdeenshire, Scotland (57.0588° N, -2.4139° W).
- Mesocosm setup: 30 intact soil cores (10 from alder stand, 10 from birch stand, 10 from Douglas fir stand) arranged in a 10 m x 10 m grid per stand.
- Experimental units: One non-mycorrhizal alder seedling transplanted into each of 10 mesocosms per soil origin (total N=30).
- Growth conditions: Climate chamber at 20°C with 14 h light; cores modified to allow external root in-growth of mycelium while excluding roots for author-controlled measurements.

## Experimental methods and measurements
- 13C pulse-labelling: 6-hour exposure to 13C-enriched air; leaf sampling before, immediately after, and at multiple time points up to 48 hours post-labelling to track 13C allocation and respiration.
- CO2 flux measurements: Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (C accumulation) measured with a portable IRGA before harvest, under light and dark conditions.
- Biomass and traits: Harvest and separate shoots, roots (primary, lateral, fine), coarse roots; determine specific leaf area (SLA); dry matter for all parts.
- Symbiont assessment:
  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) colonization quantified on fine roots; morphotypes identified; representative samples subjected to molecular analysis.
  - Frankia nodulation counted on nodules.
- Isotope and nutrient analyses:
  - 13C in leaves, fine roots, and Frankia-associated tissues; 13C in NaOH traps to assess microbial respiration contributions.
  - Leaf N and P; total soil C, N, P; exchangeable nutrients via in situ membranes; other ions (Ca, Mg, K, NO3-, NH4+, Fe, Mn, Zn, S, Pb).
  - 15N natural abundance on a subset of samples.
- DNA sequencing: ECM fungal community characterized by ITS sequencing; representative sequences submitted to GenBank (MT499907–MT499914).

## Data structure and units
- Data organized by replicate cores; rows represent individual cores; columns represent measured variables.
- Soil origin encoded as Ag (Alnus glutinosa), Bp (Betula pendula), Pm (Pseudotsuga menziesii).
- Key variables and units include:
  - Biomass: mg dry weight (dwt) for shoots, belowground components (Bgeo), coarse, lateral, and fine roots.
  - CO2 flux: mg CO2 m-2 h-1 (C_flux_Bio, C_flux).
  - ECM: percentage colonization.
  - 13C metrics: mg fixed; per mil (δ13C) values for leaves, fine roots, and Frankia tissues.
  - Nutrients: leaf N (%), leaf P (%), leaf C (%); soil C, N, P (%); macro- and micro-nutrients (µg per 10 cm^2 over 21 days, for several elements).
  - Other traits: SLA; g_core (g core), soil pH, etc.
- A table (Table 1) summarizes soil nutrient pools by origin.

## Relationships and analyses of interest
- Comparison of seedling performance across home, family, and away soils to test for positive plant–soil feedback mediated by specialist symbionts.
- Linkages among leaf N and P with symbiotic activity (Frankia nodulation and ECM) and carbon allocation patterns belowground.
- Partitioning of 13C belowground into fine roots versus nodules to infer allocation strategies and microbial contributions.

## GIS-relevant outputs and potential data products
- Spatially informed visualizations of how soil origin influences seedling growth, nutrient status, and symbiont associations.
- Maps or network diagrams showing C flow pathways from leaves to roots and nodules, including microbial respiration contributions.
- Integration-ready dataset with clear soil-origin coding (Ag, Bp, Pm) and geospatial context for policy briefs, ecological dashboards, or public-facing maps.
- Potential choropleth or point maps showing ECM colonization intensity and Frankia nodulation across soil origins if spatial coordinates of cores are available beyond the presented study site.

## Notes on data applicability and limitations
- Data cover a 6-month growth period from controlled mesocosm experiments, with lab-based isotope and sequencing analyses.
- Spatial scope limited to field stands within Crathes Estate; results are intended for understanding soil-plant-microbial interactions rather than broad geographic generalization.
- Data require lab facilities (isotope ratio mass spectrometry, cavity ring-down spectrometry, PCR/sequencing) for full analysis and interpretation.
