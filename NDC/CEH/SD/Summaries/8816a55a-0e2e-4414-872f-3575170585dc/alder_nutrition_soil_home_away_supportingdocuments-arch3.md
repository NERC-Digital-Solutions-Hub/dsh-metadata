# Plant biomass, nutrition, ecosystem carbon fluxes and soil nutrients in common alder growing on home and away soil from Aberdeenshire, Scotland. 2018

- Aim and hypotheses
  - Test how soil origin (home alder, birch family soil, away Douglas fir soil) and associated symbionts (ectomycorrhizal fungi and Frankia) shape alder seedling growth and nutrition.
  - Investigate how soil origin influences allocation of recent photosynthate (tracked with 13C) belowground to fine roots and symbionts.
  - Hypotheses:
    - Seedlings in home soils perform better due to specialist symbionts, indicating positive plant–soil feedback.
    - Leaf N is tightly linked to Frankia nodulation and belowground C allocation; leaf P is higher in home soils due to ECM-facilitated P acquisition.

- Experimental design and setting
  - Location: Crathes Estate, Aberdeenshire, Scotland (field-derived soils, controlled environment facility).
  - Soil sources: intact cores from stands of alder (home), birch (family), and Douglas fir (away).
  - Mesocosms: 10 per soil origin; each with an intact core plus root-excluding in-growth cores to permit fungal access but exclude roots.
  - Plant material: one non-mycorrhizal alder seedling per mesocosm; growth monitored for 6 months.

- 13C pulse labelling and carbon tracing
  - 13C-CO2 pulse (6 hours) introduced in a controlled chamber; leaf samples collected before labelling and at multiple intervals after labelling (up to 48 hours).
  - Measurements included 13C in leaves, allocation to fine roots and Frankia nodules, and respiration losses via NaOH traps.
  - Whole-system CO2 flux measured before harvest to estimate net carbon accumulation.

- Plant functional traits and tissue analyses
  - Growth metrics: seedling height, number of leaves; specific leaf area (SLA).
  - Root and symbiont assessment: differentiation of roots, counting Frankia nodules, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) colonization and morphotyping of ECM tips; representative samples for molecular analysis.
  - Tissue chemistry: total C, N, P in leaves; leaf N, C, P; 13C and 15N natural abundances in selected samples.

- Soil and nutrient analyses
  - Total and exchangeable soil nutrients: K, Ca, Mg, P, NO3-, NH4+; pH; soil C and N.
  - In situ nutrient supply rates via ion-exchange membrane probes.
  - Harvested soil analyzed for total C, N, P.

- Microbial and molecular analyses
  - DNA extraction from ECM root tips; ITS1F/ITS4 amplification to identify fungi.
  - Sequencing and taxonomic assignment using UNITE database.
  - Representative ECM sequences submitted to GenBank (accession MT499907–MT499914).

- Data structure and units
  - Data organized by replicate cores; soil origin coded as Ag (Alnus glutinosa), Bp (Betula pendula), Pm (Pseudotsuga menziesii).
  - Measured variables and units include: biomass components (mg dry weight), carbon flux (mg CO2 m2 h-1), ECM percentage, 13C and 15N metrics (per mil), leaf N/P/C contents (%), g_core, soil nutrient concentrations (µg 10 cm-2 21 days-1 for some ions), and other related soil/plant parameters.

- Data accessibility and documentation
  - Detailed methodological descriptions enabling replication, including isotope tracing, flux measurements, and tissue analyses.
  - Molecular data linked to sequencing efforts with GenBank deposition for ECM taxa.
  - Data structure described to support integration of multiple data streams (biomass, isotopes, nutrients, microbial data).

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Illustrates a multi-layered monitoring approach combining plant performance, isotope tracing, soil chemistry, and microbial ecology to understand ecosystem carbon and nutrient dynamics.
  - Highlights the need for comprehensive metadata to verify data quality and usability (soil origin, core design, sampling times, analytical methods).
  - Demonstrates how publicly sharing datasets (including raw isotopic data and sequencing results) can be integrated with governance and transparency practices, while acknowledging potential barriers (metadata completeness, data standardization, and dataset interoperability).
