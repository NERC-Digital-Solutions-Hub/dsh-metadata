# ECOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CUMBRIA HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and context
  - Joint initiative by Cumbria County Planning Department and Institute of Terrestrial Ecology to fill information gaps on wildlife habitats for Structure Plan policies.
  - Aimed at producing a report by March/April 1976; integrates field methods, data collection, and later data analysis (multivariate techniques such as ordination).

- Survey design and sampling framework
  - Sampling plots are randomly distributed across Cumbria; end users (policy planners) rely on standardized, map-based data.
  - Each plot is sampled within a large quadrat (approximately 200 m2) with a centre post and corner posts to define sub-quadrats.
  - Inside the large quadrat, five nested sub-quadrats are used (including 4 m2 and 25 m2 units) to capture vegetation structure and composition at multiple scales.
  - Two-person teams locate plots with objective, map-based procedures to minimize bias, using landscape features as reference points, a compass, and paced distance.

- Plot locating and layout
  - Locate an easily identifiable landscape feature near the plot on the map; travel to a control point; measure ground distance and pacing to the plot from the control point, adjusting for slope and pace length.
  - Use compass bearing and accuracy checks to ensure unbiased placement of the sampling plot in the ground location.

- Data collection within the plot
  - Ground flora and vegetation data
    - Record all vascular plants, bryophytes, and macrolichens within the smallest quadrat first; move outward to larger quadrats, recording only species not yet observed in inner quadrats.
    - Estimate percent cover-abundance for each species to the nearest 5%, with two observers providing independent estimates that are averaged.
    - Document cover for other categories: rock, water, litter, bare ground, bryophytes; ignore epiphytic bryophytes on vegetation that is not within the soil quadrats.
    - Complete a species data sheet for each quadrat and plot, using a coded system for later data sorting.
  - Soil data (soil profile at plot centre)
    - Expose a soil profile to describe horizon layers, litter, organic matter, mineral layers, and transitions; collect a 10 cm soil sample from the litter layer for laboratory analyses (pH, combustion, mechanical analysis, etc.).
    - Record detailed attributes for each soil horizon: depth, texture, color, moisture, decomposition, and structure; note presence of standing water, litter depth, and peat where applicable.
    - Use a standardized soil data sheet and a schematic profile to guide observations; note unusual features.
  - Habitat data sheets
    - Habitat data sheet: record features within the plot, including slope, aspect, and microhabitat features.
    - Plot edge sheet: record features just outside the plot edge that may influence conditions within the plot (up to ~5 m, with pacing used to estimate distances).
  - Roads, boundaries, and management
    - Record presence and condition of field boundaries (drystone walls, hedgerows, fences), as well as hedgerow management, gaps, height, and tree presence.
    - Document verge conditions, track/road types, and any boundary management activities or disturbances.
  - Vegetation habitats and other habitat types
    - Document a broad range of habitat categories: grasslands (Nardus, Agrostis-Fescue, Molinia tussocks/lawns), heather/bilberry, bogs, cotton grass communities, bryophytes on soil/rock/peat, aquatic and semi-aquatic bryophytes and lichens, epiphytic lichens, ground vegetation height, and signs of burning.
    - Record woodland habitats (scrub, conifer, hardwood, mixed; glades, underplanted areas, coppiced/felled areas, epiphytes, macrofungi, standing/dead trees).
    - Include detailed inventories for other ground habitats (cliffs, scree, rock fields, embankments, quarries, mine features, sheep scrapes, bank erosion, and other geological/geomorphological features).
  - Aquatic habitats
    - Classify streams and water bodies by flow, bed type, pools, waterfalls, weirs, springs, and emergent vegetation; distinguish between still and running waters, and record lake shore and riverbank features.
  - Management and human impact
    - Note habitation status of buildings, silage, middens, drainage, rubbish, pasture vs. hay meadow, ploughed fields, and other agricultural practices that affect habitats.
  - Finishing the plot
    - Ensure all sheets are completed with appropriate stratum/plot numbers; bag unidentified plants and soil samples clearly labeled; return equipment and samples to the designated area.
    - Use species codes from Appendix 2 for consistency; if new species are encountered, assign new codes and communicate them to other teams.

- Data handling and outputs
  - Field data are organized on standardized sheets for plants, soils, and habitats; coded data allow efficient sorting and later multivariate analyses (ordination) to understand Cumbria’s ecological variation.
  - Appendix 2 provides a reference code list for identified plant species to ensure uniform data entry across plots and teams.

- Practical notes for GIS use
  - The method generates georeferenced plot data with multi-scale vegetation, soil, and habitat attributes suitable for map-based GIS products.
  - Standardized data collection enables integration into broader landscape analyses, habitat classification schemes, and Structure Plan-related modeling.
  - Anticipated challenges include ensuring consistent data standards across teams, managing large, complex datasets, and integrating field-derived codes with GIS attribute tables.
