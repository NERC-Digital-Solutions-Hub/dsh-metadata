# ECOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CUMBRIA HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

## Aims and Context
- Purpose: inform background, purpose, and detailed field methods for a summer ecological survey of Cumbria.
- Primary goal: fill an information gap on wildlife habitats to support Structure Plan policies for future land use and nature conservation.
- Collaboration: Cumbria County Planning Department and Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE); planning department provides staff and evaluates data, ITE provides computer/lab facilities.
- Outcome: deliver a report for the Structure Plan (target March/April 1976); develop a dataset for habitat extent, quality, and variation; plan for subsequent data analysis (multivariate techniques, ordination).

## Study Area
- Cumbria: over 7,000 square kilometers, created in 1974 by amalgamating Cumberland, Westmorland, Furness, and part of the Yorkshire Dales.
- Key features: Lake District National Park at the center; Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) at Arnside/Silverdale and Solway Coast; diverse topography and land use across the county.
- Habitat emphasis: broad range from high fells (Borrowdale Volcanic rocks; Carboniferous limestone moorland) to Eden Valley dairy farming and coastal/estuarine fringes (e.g., Morecambe Bay, Solway Firth, Duddon Estuary).

## Survey Design and Plot Layout
- Sampling framework: a number of randomly distributed sampling plots across the county; plots located using map features to avoid bias.
- Plot size and nesting: each sampling unit is a 200 m2 quadrat, with nested, concentric quadrats inside for vegetation sampling (smaller quadrats with defined areas such as 4 m2 and 25 m2, among others).
- Plot marking and orientation: a centre post marked and oriented with a cross; cords extend to corner posts to define quadrats; five nested quadrats provide hierarchical sampling of vegetation.
- Plot selection on maps: plots are marked as black points on 6" OS maps; 16 black plots must be sampled; if access or safety prevents sampling a plot, a nearby red plot is substituted.
- Locating procedure (bias minimization): identify an easily recognizable landscape control point on the map, move to that point in the field, then use a Silva compass to bear to the plot, adjusting for magnetic declination; measure map-ground distance and pace exact ground distance; apply slope adjustments as needed to maintain an unbiased location.

## Data Recording Protocols

### Ground Flora (Vegetation Data)
- Systematic recording within the plot: begin in the smallest quadrat and expand outward to capture all species occurrences across quadrats.
- Species data: record vascular plants, bryophytes, and macrolichens that occur on soil within each quadrat; ignore epiphytic growth on heather or rocks for this section.
- Abundance/cover: estimate percent cover-abundance for each species to the nearest 5%; two team members should estimate and average to improve reliability.
- Additional categories: record cover for rock, water, litter, bare ground, and bryophytes at the bottom of the data sheet.
- Data sheets: use a predefined Species-Date sheet structure with fields for stratum, plot, quadrat, species, cover, and a code column for later data sorting.

### Soil Data
- Soil profiling: expose a soil profile at the plot centre and describe horizons; collect a soil core from the center using an auger (down to practical depth, up to 75 cm if needed).
- Litter and horizons: distinguish litter layer, organic matter layer, mixed mineral/organic matter layer, leached/ podzol layers, and underlying mineral material; describe depth ranges and properties (colour, moisture, texture, decomposition, structure).
- Testing and sampling: collect a 10 cm soil sample from under the litter layer for laboratory analyses (pH, combustion, mechanical analysis, and other chemical tests) at Merlewood; label samples with stratum and plot numbers.
- Documentation: complete the soil profile sheet with detailed horizon attributes; note any unusual features.

### Habitat Data Sheets
- Purpose: capture macro-habitat features and microhabitat attributes that influence biodiversity and ecosystem processes.
- Plot habitat sheet: record slope and aspect (clinometer and compass), and note features within the plot.
- Edge habitat sheet: record features immediately outside the plot edge (within 5–50 m, rough guideline) that may affect the plot.
- Physical features: roads, hedges, walls, fences, verges, management practices, and buildings; note presence, condition, and management status.
- Vegetation habitats: categorize vegetation types (e.g., Nardus grassland, Molinia-dominated swards, dense heather, bilberry, cotton grass bogs, Sphagnum bogs, bryophytes on soil/rock/peat, epiphytic lichens, aquatic bryophytes).
- Woodland habitats: classify scrub, conifer, hardwood, mixed woodland, glades, coppiced/felled areas, underplanted zones, epiphytes, macrofungi.
- Ground and aquatic habitats: record features such as scree, rock fields, embankments, quarries, mines, banks, streams/rivers (with size and flow categories), pools and lakes, river/sea interfaces, intertidal zones, saltmarsh, and other aquatic/terrestrial interfaces.
- Management and livestock: document livestock exclusion areas, pasture, hay meadows, cereals, rubbish, drainage, and recent vs. older management practices.
- Completion: ensure all habitat sheets are filled, legible, and filed with plot and stratum numbers; bag and label unidentified plants and soil samples; collect all equipment and samples.

## Data Handling, Analysis, and Dissemination
- Analytical approach: after the field season, apply multivariate techniques (e.g., ordination) to determine the range of variation in Cumbria ecosystems and habitat types.
- Data provenance and usability: emphasize tracking data sources and making datasets discoverable through metadata and accessible portals.
- Documentation and reproducibility: detailed field methods, standardized data sheets, and explicit procedures to minimize bias (location, sampling, recording) support traceability and reusability of data.

## Appendices and Operational Details
- Appendix 2: species codes and corresponding species names are provided to standardize data entry and enable efficient data handling; a list of common taxa with assigned codes is included to facilitate rapid field coding and later analysis.
- Field equipment and navigation: instructions for pace counting, distance measurement, bearing, and slope adjustments; use of compasses and clinometers; careful handling of data sheets and samples.
- Finishing procedures: after completing plots, verify that all sheets are completed, soil samples are bagged and labeled, and all equipment is collected; prepare for sampling the next plot.

## Key Data and Quality Considerations for Data-Driven Analysts
- Randomized, well-documented sampling design across a large and ecologically diverse county.
- Nested quadrat approach provides both fine-scale (4 m2) and broader (25 m2 and larger) vegetation data to support multivariate analyses.
- Comprehensive soil and habitat data capture a wide range of abiotic and biotic factors relevant to habitat classification and ecological variation.
- Explicit bias-minimization procedures for plot location and data collection, with cross-checks between team members for data reliability.
- Long-term data handling emphasis: traceable data sources, standardized species codes, metadata, and plans for broader data sharing and reuse.
