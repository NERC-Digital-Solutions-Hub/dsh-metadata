# ECOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CUMBRIA HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

## Aim
- Describe the background, purpose, and detailed field methods of the summer ecological survey of Cumbria.
- Fill information gaps on wildlife habitats to support the County Structure Plan and land-use policy development.

## Background and collaborations
- Cumbria County Planning Department and the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) jointly conduct the survey.
- Goal: produce a report for the Structure Plan by March/April 1976.
- Roles: Planning Department supplies staff and data evaluation; ITE provides computing and laboratory facilities.

## Survey design and sampling approach
- Large, diverse landscape (Lake District core, AONBs, coasts, Pennines) across Cumbria; aims to capture regional variation.
- Sampling framework:
  - Randomly distributed plots on 6" OS maps; 16 black plots used; red plots substitute when access is restricted.
  - Objective, unbiased ground-truthing through a staged location method using recognizable landscape features, bearing and distance from a control point, and paced steps.
- Plot and data collection setup:
  - 200 m^2 quadrat as the basic unit; center post and corner posts with cords to define nested quadrats (progressively smaller sampling areas) for vegetation assessment.
  - Ground flora data collected from nested quadrats; emphasis on plants, bryophytes, and macrolichens, with careful handling of uncertain identifications.
  - Percent cover-abundance estimated for each species to the nearest 5%; both team members provide estimates and average them to improve reliability.

## Soil sampling and soil data
- Soil profile described at the center of each plot using a standardized sheet.
- Deep soil cores collected with an auger to expose horizons; samples bagged for later pH and other analyses (combustion, mechanical analysis, and chemical analyses).
- Soil description includes litter layer, organic matter layer, mineral layers, color, moisture, texture, decomposition, structure, transitions (e.g., podzols), and depth measurements.
- If features are absent, corresponding sections are deleted; if present, depths and attributes are recorded.

## Habitat and site data
- Habitat data sheets capture features within the plot and at the plot edge, including slope, aspect, roads, hedgerows, and boundary conditions.
- Management and land-use attributes recorded: buildings, silage, middens, drainage, ploughing, grassland types, and presence of livestock droppings.
- Vegetation habitats documented (grasses, heaths, bogs, bryophytes, epiphytic lichens, aquatic and meadow habitats, etc.) with minimum cover criteria for recording.
- Woodland habitats recorded (scrub, conifer, hardwood, mixed, glades, young plantations, underplanted areas, coppiced/felled areas; epiphytes and macrofungi noted where relevant).

## Main physiographic and other habitat features
- Features within 50 m of plot edge documented (e.g., scree, rock fields, embankments, quarries, banks, streams, lakes, lakeshores, intertidal zones, peat areas).
- Distinctions between ground, water, and other habitats made with standardized definitions (e.g., streams categorized by flow, pools, waterfalls, weirs, reservoirs, sea cliff intertidal zones).

## Finishing the plot and data handling
- Ensure all sheets are complete with stratum/plot numbers; collect and label soil samples and unidentified plants; bag and label all collected materials.
- Return equipment and samples to base; proceed to the next plot and repeat.
- Species recorded with coded references from Appendix 2; any new species given a new code and communicated to other groups.

## Data management and standardization
- Field data captured on multiple sheets (Ground Flora, Soil, Habitat Date, Plot Habitats, etc.) with consistent identifiers (stratum, plot, recorder, date).
- Appendix 2 provides a coded species list to standardize data entry and cross-sheet consistency.
- Emphasis on preparing data for later multivariate analysis (e.g., ordination) to characterize variation in Cumbria’s ecosystems.

## Outputs and analysis
- Data will be analyzed using multivariate techniques to establish variation ranges across Cumbria ecosystems.
- Intended deliverable: a comprehensive ecological survey report to inform the Structure Plan by 1976.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates a rigorous, standardized data collection system with explicit protocols, metadata, and cross-sheet integration.
- Emphasizes data quality, objectivity, and bias minimization through randomized sampling and reproducible field methods.
- Highlights early use of controlled vocabularies (coded species) and structured data management to enable later analysis and policy use.
- Shows integration of data collection with policy processes and inter-agency collaboration for governance and impact.
