# ECOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CUMBRIA HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- A joint initiative of the Cumbria County Planning Department and the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology to document wildlife habitats across Cumbria and inform the Structure Plan (target: report by March/April 1976).
- Builds on methods developed for semi-natural woodlands and regional ecological surveys; aims to fill information gaps beyond designated sites (SSSIs and nature reserves).

## Survey design and sampling framework

- Based on randomly distributed sampling plots; 16 plots marked on 6" survey maps, to be visited.
- Each plot is a large 200 m2 quadrat, within which five nested quadrats (progressively smaller sampling units) are used for vegetation recording.
- Within-plot data (plants, soils, habitats) are recorded with standardized sheets; data to be analysed later with multivariate techniques (e.g., ordination) to describe variation in Cumbria ecosystems.
- Outputs intended to support Structure Plan policies on land use and nature conservation.

## Plot locating and setup

- Work in pairs; locate each plot using:
  - An easily recognisable landscape feature near the plot.
  - A control point and a Silva compass bearing, with ground distance measured from the control point.
  - Pacing to land accurately in the plot center; adjustments for slope and pace length.
- Steps ensure minimal subjective bias in plot placement; some minor inaccuracies allowed but bias is avoided.

## Data collection and recording

- Ground flora data sheet
  - Start in the smallest inner quadrat; record all vascular plants, bryophytes, and macrolichens on soil.
  - Note uncertain identifications by collecting and labeling specimens for later confirmation.
  - Move to larger quadrats, recording new species not yet observed in inner quadrats.
  - Estimate percent cover-abundance for each species to the nearest 5%; compute mean of two observers’ estimates.
  - Record cover for other categories (rock, water, litter, bare ground, bryophytes) at the bottom.

- Soil data sheet
  - Describes a single soil profile at the plot center; expose and sample down to the deepest practicable level with minimal disturbance.
  - Record soil horizons (litter, organic matter, transition to mineral soil, leached/deposition layers, underlying material), colour, moisture, texture, and structure.
  - Use a standardized set of attributes (e.g., decomposition, texture, transition types, podzol indicators) with explicit scales.
  - Collect a 10 cm soil sample from beneath the litter layer for laboratory analyses (pH, combustion, mechanical/chemical analyses).

- Habitat data sheets
  - Plot habitat sheet: record within-plot features such as slope (clinometer), aspect, roads, boundaries, hedgerows, management, buildings, rubbish, drainage, fences, verge conditions, etc.
  - Edge habitat sheet: capture features just outside the plot edge that may affect the plot (up to ~5 m distance initially; broader as familiarity grows).

- Management and land-use features
  - Distinguish inhabited vs used buildings, silage pits, middens, recent ploughing, drainage, rubbish, pasture vs hay meadows, and other agricultural practices.

- Vegetation and woodland habitats
  - Record dominant vegetation types (e.g., Nardus grassland, Molinia tussocks, heather, bilberry, bracken) and whether cover exceeds thresholds (e.g., 25 m for certain microhabitats).
  - Document woodland types (scrub, conifer/broadleaf/mixed), glades, coppiced/underplanted areas, felled or deadwood features, epiphytic flora, and macrofungi presence.

- Ground habitats
  - Record physical ground features (gorges, scree, rock fields, embankments, quarries, mine remnants, rock patterns) and their extent.
  - Note banks, gullies, eroding features, peat/soil interactions, and rock/stone distributions.

- Aquatic habitats
  - Streams and rivers categorized by flow; bed type, shingle banks, pools, waterfalls, weirs, springs, seepage.
  - Freshwater bodies classified (size classes); lakes, reservoirs, riverbanks, streambanks.
  - Marine/intertidal features recorded (saltmarsh, intertidal mud) and emergent vegetation near lakes.

- Other habitats
  - Include peat-cutting sites, islands, artificial ditches, drains, and any unique features observed.

- Main physiographic features within 50 m of plot edge
  - Document larger-scale features (e.g., young vs old conifer plantations, rock outcrops, scree, banks) following the same definitions as habitat sheets.

- Within-50 m management and ground habitats crosswalk
  - Systematically categorize adjacent management types (hedges, walls, verges, roads, dwellings, pasture, arable fields, coppiced/forested areas).

## Finishing the plot and data handling

- Ensure all sheets (stratum/plot identifiers, species, cover data) are complete; bag and label soil and plant specimens for later identification.
- Collect and consolidate all equipment and samples; prepare for the next plot.
- Species coding: use predefined codes listed in Appendix; new species receive a new code and are communicated to other groups promptly.

## Appendices and data outputs

- Appendix 2: comprehensive species-code mapping for field data entry (extensive list of vascular plants, bryophytes, and associated taxa).
- Data outputs intended for subsequent multivariate analysis (ordination) to characterize Cumbria ecosystems and contribute to Structure Plan policy development.

## Relevance for data support and insights

- Provides a rigorous, standardized protocol for collecting diverse ecological data (plants, soils, habitats) across large areas.
- Produces structured, self-contained data products (species lists, cover estimates, soil profiles, habitat classifications) suitable for integration, cleaning, transformation, and public-friendly visualization.
- Facilitates cross-plot comparisons and long-term ecological understanding through consistent methodology and explicit metadata (plots, strata, habitats, management).
- Supports transparent data sharing and reuse through explicit codes, sheets, and appendix references.
