# Experimental design/sampling regime

- UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) collects data from over 1,000 sites annually across the UK.
- Data collection methods include all-species transects (Pollard walks), single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts.
- Transects are fixed routes to enable year-to-year comparison and sampling across habitat/management units.
- All-species transects: 2–4 km routes, 5 m wide recording band, 26 counts per year from early April to late September; counts occur weekly under suitable weather.
- Weather and activity constraints: observations typically between 10:45 and 15:45; suitable butterfly activity requires dry conditions, Beaufort wind < 5, and temperature thresholds (≥13°C with sun or ≥17°C if overcast).

- Data collection forms and entry:
  - Field data recorded on standard forms.
  - Entered into Transect Walker software (free). Data can be entered by recorders or regional transect coordinators.
  - Transect Walker files uploaded to an Oracle database; regional coordinators consolidate data for their region.

- Sampling variations:
  - All-species transects sample multiple habitats; single-species transects cover focal species for a subset of weeks.
  - Timed counts measure abundance of a species over a set time/area.
  - Egg/larval web counts document eggs or larval webs in suitable habitats.

- Data quality and verification:
  - Automatic checks in Transect Walker flag potential data entry errors (e.g., abnormal counts, out-of-season records).
  - Regional coordinators review data for questionable records.
  - Additional automated/manual validation checks against distribution records, flight periods, first-time site records, extreme or unusual abundances.

- Data products and outputs:
  - Site indices: relative measures of population size, derived via statistical modeling.
  - Collated Indices: national annual indices for each species, combining data from monitored sites.
  - Trends: linear trends calculated from collated indices over specified time frames.

- Time frames and data updates:
  - Trends computed for the full series (from 1976), last 20 years (1993–2012), and last 10 years (2003–2012).
  - Collated indices updated annually as new data are received; past year values may be revised.

- Notable limitations:
  - Some species lack long enough data series for full trend calculation; indices for those species may have shorter trend histories.
