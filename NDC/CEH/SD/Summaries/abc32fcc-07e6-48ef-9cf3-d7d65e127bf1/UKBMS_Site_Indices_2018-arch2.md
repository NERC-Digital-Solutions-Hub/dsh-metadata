# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- A multi‑organization monitoring program funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Relies on volunteers; provides annual data on butterfly population status to inform biodiversity status and policy questions.
- Since 1976, with over 2500 actively recorded sites each year; results integrate multiple components to assess trends.

## Data collection and monitoring components
- Sampling framework includes:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts Apr–Sep, ~26 counts/year, ~2000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–4 visits/year (min 2 in Jul/Aug), ~750 squares/year.
- All components’ results are analyzed together for overall species indices.

## Data characteristics and trend analysis
- Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures, not absolute counts).
- Site index represents a constant proportion of the population; detectability varies by species.
- Indices for species are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site/year.
- All counts across the season are used to model seasonal patterns and fill gaps; observed data are weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

## Quality control and data management
- Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online (UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker) and uploaded to a central database.
- Automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, species outside known flight periods); regional coordinators validate data; ongoing checks throughout the season.
- Further automated/manual validation includes queries for records outside distribution ranges, unusual dates, first-time site records, and extreme abundances; corrections are made via targeted data queries.

## Data download details
- Annual indices of abundance for each species at each site with sufficient data, 1976–2018, provided as a CSV.
- Key columns:
  - SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES (Latin name per Fauna Europaea v2.2), COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX.
- Note: if a species was recorded at a site in a year but not monitored sufficiently, SITE INDEX is -2.

## Licence and attribution
- Data provided under Open Government Licence (OGL) with free use and reuse under conditions.
- Citations/DOIs must be included in any reports/publications using the data.
- Attribution statement: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.

## Challenges for analysts
- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data sources (moving beyond single-use outputs).
- Enabling broad access to the underlying data used to produce outputs, facilitating reuse and secondary analyses.
