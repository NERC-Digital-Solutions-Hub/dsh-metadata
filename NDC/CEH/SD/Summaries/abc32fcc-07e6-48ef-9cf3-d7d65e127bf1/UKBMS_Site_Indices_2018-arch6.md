# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers contribute data, with over 2500 sites actively recorded each year.
- Purpose: to monitor butterfly population status across the UK and address biodiversity policy questions.
- Since 1976, UKBMS combines data from site-based monitoring and random 1km square sampling to derive annual population indices.

## Data collection and components

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects 2–4 km long, 5 m wide, 26 counts per year, typically 45 minutes to 2 hours, 2000+ sites.
- Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods, including timed counts and egg/larval web counts.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–4 visits per year (minimum 2 visits in July/August), around 750 squares per year.
- All components contribute to a unified UKBMS dataset used to assess butterfly population changes.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- Data are expressed as abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of the population observed, with variations by species in detectability.
- Collated indices for each species are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016) with a weighting adjustment that accounts for the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year at each site.
- The method uses all counts in a season to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolates to account for recording gaps, giving more weight to observed data than to extrapolated data.

## Quality control

- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Automatic checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-season records); regional coordinators validate records and perform ongoing checks.
- Additional automated and manual validation screens identify records outside known ranges, unusual distributions, first-time site records, and extreme abundances; corrections are made via targeted queries and consultations with coordinators or recorders.

## Details of this data download

- Provides annual indices of abundance for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, covering 1976–2018.
- Data format: CSV file.
- Key columns:
  - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
  - COUNTRY: region used for the regional collated index
  - SPECIES CODE: unique species identifier
  - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea, v2.2)
  - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (Emmet & Heath)
  - YEAR: year of the collated index
  - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year; -2 indicates insufficient data to compute an accurate site index
