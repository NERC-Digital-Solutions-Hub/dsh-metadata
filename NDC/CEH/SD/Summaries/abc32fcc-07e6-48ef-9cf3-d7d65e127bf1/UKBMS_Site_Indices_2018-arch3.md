# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and governance
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - It relies on volunteer data and serves to monitor butterfly population status to inform policy and biodiversity status/trends questions.

- Data coverage and components
  - Annual, site-based monitoring supplemented by random 1 km square sampling.
  - Three main components:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects 2–4 km long; counts along a 5 m band; typically 26 counts/year at ~2000 sites.
    - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species.
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares with two parallel short transects; ~750 squares/year; focuses on common habitats (e.g., farmland).

- Data nature and trend analysis
  - Data are used to create abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Site indices are combined into species-level collated indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with annual site-weighting based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
  - The approach uses all counts across the season to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate for gaps, with observed data given more weight.

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies, and regional transect coordinators validate records throughout the season.
  - Further automated/manual validation ensures records are within known distribution ranges, flight periods, and typical site abundances, with corrections via queries as needed.

- Data download and structure
  - The download provides annual species abundance indices for each site with data from 1976–2018 in CSV format.
  - Key columns include:
    - SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX
  - If a site could not be adequately monitored for a species in a given year, SITE INDEX is marked as -2.

- Licence and attribution
  - Data are provided under the Open Government Licence (OGL).
  - Users must include the specified citation and attribution: contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, JNCC.
  - A Digital Object Identifier must be cited in any publications describing research using the data.

- Collaboration and contact
  - UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset interpretation and potential co-authorships or intellectual input for publications.
