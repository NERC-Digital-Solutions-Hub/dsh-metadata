# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with significant volunteer involvement. It has monitored butterfly population changes across the UK since 1976, currently at over 2,500 active sites each year.
- Data are collected via a mix of site-based monitoring and random 1 km square sampling, including:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m width, recording all species weekly from April to September (about 26 counts/year) at ~2,000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, targeted surveys (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): two parallel 1 km transects in stratified random 1 km squares, ~750 squares/year, with 2–4 visits per year to sample common habitats.
- Data are analyzed together to produce monitoring progress and policy-relevant answers about biodiversity trends; components are combined to form collated indices.

- Nature of data and trend analysis:
  - The scheme uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Indices are calculated for each site and species; an overarching collated index is derived using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with a weighting adjustment that emphasizes observed data proportional to flight-period survey coverage.
  - Counts from all components are used to model seasonal patterns and to extrapolate for gaps, with weighting favoring observed data.

- Quality control:
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators review records; data undergo automated and manual validation to identify out-of-range records, records outside known distributions, first-time site records, and unusual abundances; corrections are applied as needed.

- Details of this data download:
  - Contains annual abundance indices for each species at each UK site with sufficient data from 1976–2018.
  - Provided as a CSV with columns:
    - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
    - COUNTRY: region contributing to the regional collated index
    - SPECIES CODE: unique species code
    - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea)
    - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (references provided)
    - YEAR: year of the collated index
    - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site in that year; -2 indicates insufficient data to compute a reliable index
