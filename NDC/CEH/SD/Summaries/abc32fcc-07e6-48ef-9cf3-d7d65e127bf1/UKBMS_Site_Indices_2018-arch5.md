# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Governance and ownership: organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee; relies on volunteers; substantial UK-wide collaborative effort.
- Purpose: annual data on butterfly population status across the UK, enabling understanding of biodiversity trends and informing policy questions.
- Scale: monitoring at around 2,500 active sites annually; results from multiple components are analyzed together.

## Data collection components

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, 26 counts per year (April–Sept), around 2,000 sites.
- Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or methods.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects subdivided into 10 sections, 2–4 visits per year (mid-summer emphasis), ~750 squares annually.
- Data integration: results from all components are combined for overall species indices.

## Data nature and trend analysis

- Indices are abundance indices (relative measures), not absolute counts; reflect proportional presence at sites.
- Aggregation method: Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with year- and site-weighting to account for flight period coverage; uses counts from all components to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, giving more weight to observed data.

## Quality control

- In-field data collection on standard forms; online entry via UKBMS data site or Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks detect anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods); regional transect coordinators validate data throughout the season.
- Additional validation includes cross-checks against known distributions and flight periods; data edits are applied to the main dataset as needed.

## Details of this data download

- Data scope: annual abundance indices for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, covering 1976–2018.
- Format: CSV file with columns:
  - SITE CODE (unique site identifier)
  - COUNTRY (regional index provenance)
  - SPECIES CODE (unique species identifier)
  - SPECIES (scientific name per Fauna Europaea)
  - COMMON NAME (vernacular name per Emmet & Heath)
  - YEAR (year of collated index)
  - SITE INDEX (abundance index for that species/site/year; -2 indicates insufficient data for index)
