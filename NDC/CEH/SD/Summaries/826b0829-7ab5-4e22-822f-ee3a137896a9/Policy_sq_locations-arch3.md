# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise utility of CS spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- CS partners: CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys to maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled by CEH under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Circumstances for release and level of precision
- Access allows identification of whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone); four-digit grid references can be released to indicate 10x10 km grid square location.
- Six-digit precise locations are only released in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances if pre-processing analysis cannot be performed by CEH to avoid release; licensees must demonstrate equal or higher confidentiality/IP protection than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (habitats, linear features) could indirectly reveal square location and are released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
- Four-digit releases use licenses with terms similar to six-digit releases but without the higher IP confidentiality requirement.
- License terms prohibit using data to identify exact square locations or to plan visits; also prohibit using data to check compliance by landowners.
- If needed, user must not retain data beyond the licence period; must destroy data at end of licensing period; sources must be securely stored and access restricted.

## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licences for location data must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences granted for finite periods for specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- Written confirmation of data destruction required after licensing period.
- No third-party release that could compromise confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Licensees must follow JCOP or equivalent project management standards if requested.
- For four-digit grid references, licence terms are similar but not required to meet the highest IP confidentiality criteria as six-digit releases.
- Licences include a clause preventing attempts to derive precise square locations from supplied data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences; licences signed by senior authority from the licensee organization.
- If access is denied, CEH supports the decision under Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH should provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes for CS partnership needs; requests from other organizations handled case-by-case.
- Partners are recommended to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or fee-based depending on case.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks (for authors)
- Balances data utility with confidentiality to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Requires clear data governance: licensing, secure storage, access controls, and time-bounded data use.
- Highlights the need for pre-processing or anonymization/aggregation to avoid releasing precise locations.
- Emphasizes governance oversight, annual reporting, and stakeholder consultation to manage data access in monitoring programs.
- Demonstrates how to handle exceptional access requests, including demonstrating equivalent or higher confidentiality for IP and defined licensing terms.
