# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field surveys from their origin in 1978 up to 2007.
- Emphasizes the need for stratified, representative sampling and the linkage between classification, sampling, and national habitat estimates.
- Documents how classifications and sampling were adapted to support country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and upland habitat assessment.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification
- Early concept (1970s): Stratified ecological sampling using environmental attributes to define land classes; aim to ensure representative sampling of Britain.
- 1978 (First GB survey): 32 ITE Land Classes created from a 1 km square framework; initial stratified random sampling used 256 squares (8 per class) from classified centers plus surrounding squares.
- 1984 (Second GB survey): Sample size increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the 32-class framework.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990): Expanded to classify every GB 1 km square; 508 squares surveyed; incorporation of urban/seascape corrections and linkage to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification for CS2000): Classification extended to enable Scotland-only reporting; number of classes increased to 40; groundwork laid for separate country estimates.
- 2007 (Revised Land Classification for CS2007): Responded to Wales-only reporting needs post-devolution; sub-divided land classes into country-unit versions (England & Wales) creating five new Welsh classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increasing to 45 strata; additional Welsh samples implemented to ensure representation; England samples adjusted accordingly.

## Sampling Framework and Field Surveys
- Core approach: Stratified random sampling using the ITE Land Classification as the framework (land classes as strata).
- Sample sizes and distribution:
  - 1978: 256 total squares (8 per class) across 32 classes.
  - 1984: 384 squares (12 per class) across 32 classes.
  - 1990: 508 squares, all GB squares classified; additional urban/seaspaper corrections; focus on field survey of habitat features and vegetation.
  - 2000 (CS2000): 40 strata; country-unit adjustments; additional 19 squares to improve class representation; upland module added later.
  - 2007 (CS2007): 45 strata in total for Wales/England & Scotland framework; Wales receives 43 extra squares to bolster Welsh representation; some English classes temporarily reduced to 4 squares per class in a few instances.
- Country-specific reporting:
  - Separate country estimates implemented to deliver England & Wales and Scotland-specific results.
  - CS2000 introduced class sub-division and aggregation to create country-unit versions of land classes, with total strata increasing from 40 to 40+ (ultimately 45 for CS2007); additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation in each country.
- Upland habitat focus:
  - CS2000 included an uplands module (30 additional squares) to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Data Outputs and Usage
- Outputs include national estimates of habitat areas and land-use features derived from mean habitat area per square within each land class multiplied by the land-class area across GB.
- Progressively refined to enable country-specific estimates and Wales-only reporting; CS1990 provided GB-wide results, CS2000 and CS2007 provided country-unit results and Wales-focused reporting.
- Detailed tables and maps (e.g., class maps, sample square maps, and per-class/sample counts) accompany the reports, with explicit sampling rates and class distributions.

## Key Data Governance Considerations for Data Stewards
- Versioning and lineage:
  - Each survey cycle introduced revisions to the Land Classification; maintain clear version control and metadata to document which classification version was used for each set of national estimates (e.g., 1990 GB-wide, 2000 England & Wales, 2007 Wales-specific).
- Metadata and provenance:
  - Capture and store detailed metadata on classification definitions, strata boundaries, and the rationale for subdividing classes (e.g., country-unit splits for England–Wales and Scotland).
  - Document the sampling frame (center squares, surrounding squares), the number of squares per class, and any adjustments made for country reporting or upland modules.
- Comparability and consistency:
  - Note that changing the Land Classification affects comparability of national estimates across surveys; ensure users understand which classification was used and provide methods to translate or compare across versions.
- Data updates and governance:
  - Track updates such as the introduction of country-specific reporting, Welsh-class subdivisions, and upland modules; ensure updates propagate to all datasets, analyses, and published summaries.
- Data quality and limitations:
  - Acknowledge potential under- or over-representation of certain land classes due to sampling adjustments (e.g., reductions to English class counts in CS2007) and the implications for national estimates.
- Accessibility and dissemination:
  - Ensure data, classification maps, sampling schemes, and estimation procedures are accessible with sufficient documentation to support reproducibility and reuse by researchers and practitioners.
