# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy aims to maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of survey site locations.
- It only applies to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

## CS partners (current)
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports the public interest by sustaining the survey’s ability to inform environmental policy.

## Circumstances for release and precision
- Four-digit grid references (identifying 10x10 km grid squares) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references are only released under VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, with proof that the IP/data to be used with CS data carries equal or higher confidentiality protection than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and are treated with the same exceptional access terms as six-digit locations.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to approved individuals.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained afterward.
- End-of-licence confirmation required that data remained secure and was destroyed.
- Data must not be shared with third parties in a way that could compromise confidentiality, nor used to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases share similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality; license terms prohibit attempts to identify precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 procedures.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal CS partner needs for pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partner organisations and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data under this policy; CEH involvement may be through collaboration or payment negotiations.

## Practical guidance for analysts monitoring the environment
- Access to precise location data is controlled to protect sampling integrity and landowner relationships; licensing enables use for approved monitoring projects.
- If direct access to precise locations is not possible, four-digit grid references or pre-processing by CEH can provide useful, approved alternatives.
- Ensure compliance with licence terms, including data security, restricted use, and destruction at project end.
- Consider consulting CEH for pre-processing needs or to discuss appropriate data usage aligned with policy requirements.
