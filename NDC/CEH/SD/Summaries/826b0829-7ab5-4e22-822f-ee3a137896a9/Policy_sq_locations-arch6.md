# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Current CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When locations may be released and at what precision
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) can be released under licence to indicate which grid a survey square falls in.
- Six-digit grid references released only in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may preprocess analyses to avoid needing precise locations, or grant external access under licence if IP/data confidentiality requirements are demonstrated to be equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) can indirectly reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-terms as six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmed in writing at the end of the period.
- No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality; no use to guide visits or to monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases carry similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements.
- A clause prohibits attempts to deduce precise square locations from the data or to claim such capability.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, acting for NERC, makes exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS-partner use; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may vary by collaboration or payment and will be negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for data use and support
- Access to precise locations is tightly controlled; licensing enables controlled use for defined projects.
- Data users must implement strict data-handling and security practices and acknowledge the confidentiality constraints.
- Data supporters should coordinate with CEH early to define requirements, assess feasibility, and determine appropriate licensing pathways.
