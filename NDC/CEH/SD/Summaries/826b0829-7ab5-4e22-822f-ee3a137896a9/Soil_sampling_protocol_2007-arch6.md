# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Electric Cold Box, kept cool by charging whenever the vehicle is driven (connected to the vehicle lighter socket)
- Electrical mains charger for use in accommodation
- 2 knives
- 2 plastic plates
- Hammer
- 2 pairs of pliers
- Mallet
- Regular trowel
- Long thin trowel
- Notebook & pen
- Parcel tape
- Spare cores
- 1 pack for the appropriate square containing:
  - X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags
  - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Cores taken approximately 15 cm S of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot of every square; 5 soil sampling locations per square
- If problems occur or a comment is needed (e.g., large tree roots), record in the envelope
- If unusual vegetation, cow pat, boulder, etc., move minimum distance to achieve a homogeneous location and record the problem

Taking the cores
- For each core, use the correct labelled bag for this X-plot; there are 4 cores and 4 sample bags
- Clear surface vegetation and plant material
- Use the pipe: hold upright with bevelled end on soil surface, cut round the bottom edge with knife; cut vertically through roots
- Push pipe firmly into ground until upright
- Place grey plastic plate on top of pipe and hammer until the core is level with soil surface
- If depth is insufficient, move sampling point and start again; record as above
- If pipe breaks or distorts, use one of the spare pipes
- Use pliers to twist/pull pipe free slowly to avoid losing soil from ends
- Scrape/remove lumps of soil from exterior of the pipe
- If needed, cut bottom end of the core to be level with the end of the pipe
- Ensure correct core orientation; see storage notes below
- Repeat for each centre quadrat in each X-plot (five sampling locations per square)

Core types (locations relative to the black core)
- Core C: BLACK, 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter
  - Locate 15 cm south of the corner of the centre quadrat
  - Place into plastic bag and seal
- Core F: SHORT WHITE, 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - Leave litter layer intact
  - Locate 15 cm east of the black core
  - Cap ends, seal in its bag, return to the plastic bag
- Core N: LONG WHITE, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - Locate 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from south corner of the centre quadrat)
  - Cap ends, seal and return to plastic bag
- Core P: LONG GREY, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - Locate 15 cm west of the black core; orient with bevelled end on soil surface
  - Cap ends, seal and return to plastic bag

Composite soil sample (SQID)
- Collect 8–10 sub-samples along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat using the long thin trowel, forming a square the width of the trowel
- Place sub-samples into the labelled bag
- If ground is very stony, move sampling point and record
- If depth is insufficient, move sampling point and start again; record
- Fill the bag to the top white panel; if not full, collect more samples until full
- Seal the bag, enclose in another bag, and seal
- Note: the composite sample is taken in each SQID and stored as described above

A1.1.3. Sampling procedures for SQID (summary)
- Move vegetation as needed to access soil surface
- Use long thin trowel to form and collect the required sub-sample pattern
- Place samples into the appropriate bag
- Record any issues (unusual vegetation, cow pat, boulder) and adjust sampling location accordingly

A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

Core C: BLACK
- Store in its sample bag; once all black cores for a square are collected, store together in a spare plastic bag
- Store in the cardboard box in the vehicle; keep cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to the regional coordinator

Core F: SHORT WHITE
- Place in its bag, with other short white cores from this square, in the cool box
- When all 5 samples are taken, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post as soon as possible

Core P: GREY
- Place in its bag with other long grey cores from this square; store in the cool box
- When all 5 samples are taken, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post as soon as possible

Core N: WHITE
- Place in its bag with other long grey cores from this square; store in the cool box
- When all 5 samples are taken, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Bangor; seal and post as soon as possible

Soil Sample Bag
- Place this sample in the cool box immediately; as soon as possible place in mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post

Posting
- Post samples as soon as possible
- If samples cannot be posted by the last post on Thursday, place them in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
- Do not post any samples on a Friday
- If nearest post boxes cannot take these packages, use a convenient Post Office
- Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Offices
