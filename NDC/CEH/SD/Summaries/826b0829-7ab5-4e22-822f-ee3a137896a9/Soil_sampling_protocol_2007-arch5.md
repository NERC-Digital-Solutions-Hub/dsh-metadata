# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Electric Cold Box powered by vehicle; mains charger for accommodation.
- Field toolkit: 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs pliers, mallet, regular trowel, long thin trowel, notebook & pen, parcel tape, spare cores, and a pack containing X-plot cores, end caps, labeled bags, and stamped mailbags for 5 X-plots.
- Purpose: support standardized soil core sampling and secure, traceable handling of samples.

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Sampling location: cores taken approx. 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot per square; note any problems or deviations in an envelope.
- Problem handling: if unusual vegetation or obstacles, move sampling point and record the adjustment.

# Core sampling procedures

- For each core (C, F, N, P), follow location-specific rules:
  - Core C (Black, 15 cm x 5 cm): locate 15 cm south of centre quadrat corner; label and seal in a plastic bag.
  - Core F (Short White, 8 cm x 4 cm): 15 cm east of black core; keep litter layer intact; orient and seal ends; bag after collection.
  - Core N (Long White, 15 cm x 4 cm): 15 cm south of black core; label and seal.
  - Core P (Long Grey, 15 cm x 4 cm): 15 cm west of black core; ensure correct orientation (bevelled end on soil surface); label and seal.
- Composite soil sample: from 8–10 sub-samples collected with the long thin trowel along the 5 m quadrat boundary; fill a bag to the top white panel, seal, and combine with other sub-samples as needed.
- Core labeling and handling: use the correct core for the specified position; avoid loss of soil; if the pipe is damaged, use a spare.

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Storage by core type:
  - Core C (Black): bag, then bundle with other blacks; store in a cool box, away from direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator.
  - Core F (Short White): bag in a larger bag with other F cores; store in cool box immediately; after five samples, place in CEH Lancaster mailbag and post promptly.
  - Core P (Grey): bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; post after all samples from the square.
  - Core N (White): bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; post to CEH Bangor after all samples from the square.
- General: Place the soil samples in the cool box immediately; then send in mailbags labeled for CEH Lancaster (for C, F, P, and the soil sample bag) or CEH Bangor (for N) as soon as possible.
- Posting guidelines: post as soon as possible; if last post is Thursday, hold over weekend and post Monday; do not post on Fridays; use OS map data or Road Atlas to locate the appropriate Post Office; if a post box cannot accommodate the package, use a convenient Post Office.

# Data stewardship considerations for this protocol

- Metadata and provenance: maintain consistent labeling (C, F, N, P), square-specific and X-plot identifiers, and a record of all deviations or problem notes in envelopes.
- Data quality and standardization: ensure cores are correctly located, oriented, and sealed; document all adjustments to sampling points (e.g., due to vegetation or obstacles) for traceability.
- Data accessibility and sharing: samples are dispatched to centralized CEH facilities (Lancaster or Bangor) with standardized mailbag labeling to enable provenance tracking.
- Data storage and lifecycle: live data (locations, core IDs, sampling points, issues) should be captured alongside physical samples to support audit and reuse.
- Risk management: anticipate potential delays in posting and coordinate with regional coordinators to maintain timeliness and sample integrity.
