# Soil Core Sampling Protocol for X-Plots

## Purpose and scope
- Protocol for collecting soil cores (C, F, N, P) across 120 squares (X-plots) with five sampling locations per square.
- Each square yields four individual cores plus a composite soil sample (8–10 sub-samples) along the 5-meter quadrat boundary.
- Emphasis on correct core identification, sample integrity, and detailed record-keeping to support data quality and traceability.

## Equipment
- Electric Cold Box and vehicle charger; mains charger for accommodation.
- Hand tools: 2 knives, 2 pairs of pliers, hammer, mallet, regular and long thin trowels, spare cores.
- Packaging: notebook, pen, parcel tape, labelled bags, mailbags, correspondingly stamped envelopes.
- Core-specific components: end caps, X-plot packs, and 5 X-plots per square packaging.
- Storage and transport: cool box, cardboard boxes, sealable bags, and separate mailbags for CEH Lancaster and CEH Bangor.

## Sampling locations and target cores
- Core C: BLACK, 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner. Use the black core length as the distance reference.
- Core F: SHORT WHITE, 8 cm x 4 cm; located 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact.
- Core N: LONG WHITE, 15 cm x 4 cm; located 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner of the centre quadrat).
- Core P: LONG GREY, 15 cm x 4 cm; located 15 cm west of the black core; must be oriented with the bevelled end on the soil surface.

- For each core:
  - Clear vegetation/plant material; ensure correct position; if issues arise, note in the envelope.
  - If ground is problematic (roots, rocks, etc.), move sampling point and record the change.

## Composite soil sample
- Within each square, collect a composite sample of 8–10 sub-samples to a depth of 15 cm along the 5 m quadrat boundary.
- Use the long thin trowel to form a square the width of the trowel; place sub-samples into the labeled bag.
- Fill the bag to the top of the top white panel; seal and combine into the appropriate lab packaging if needed.

## Sample handling and storage
- After collection, process and store cores by type in the vehicle, in cool conditions, away from direct sunlight.
- Core C (BLACK): store in its own bag; later combine with other black cores in a spare bag; place in a cardboard box in the vehicle.
- Core F (SHORT WHITE): place in its bag, then in a larger bag with other short white cores; store in the cool box; after five samples, post in the CEH Lancaster mailbag.
- Core P (GREY): place in its bag with other long grey cores; store in the cool box; post in the CEH Lancaster mailbag once all five samples are collected.
- Core N (WHITE): place in its bag with other long grey cores; store in the cool box; post in the CEH Bangor mailbag once all five samples are collected.
- Soil Sample Bag: place in the cool box; post in the CEH Lancaster mailbag as soon as possible.

## Posting and dispatch
- Post samples as soon as possible.
- If last post is Thursday, keep samples in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday; do not post on Friday.
- If local post boxes cannot accept packages, use an alternative Post Office.
- Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Office locations.

## Documentation and notes
- Record any problems or unusual conditions (e.g., large roots, unusual vegetation) in the envelope.
- If sampling conditions are challenging (limited depth, dense roots), move samples and document changes.
- Ensure the right orientation for Core P; if a core breaks or distorts significantly, use a spare core.
