# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
- Current partners include CEH, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve the representativeness of sampling sites and the goodwill of landowners.
- Confidentiality supports the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH, under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence to indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit (precise) locations require CEH preprocessing to avoid direct release; in very exceptional cases, external release may occur under licence if the requester demonstrates IP confidentiality comparable to or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.

## Licence conditions and usage restrictions
- Licensees must:
  - Preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Use licenses for finite periods and destroy data at project end; provide written destruction confirmation.
  - Not release data to third parties that could compromise square locations.
  - Not use data to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - Provide evidence of project management standards equivalent to JCOP if requested.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality threshold of six-digit releases.
- License terms prohibit efforts to derive exact square locations from released data.

## Licensing responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licenses with appropriate clauses.
- If a release is denied, CEH will follow statutory processes under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe; case-by-case consideration for external requests.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to CS location data use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid depending on arrangements.
