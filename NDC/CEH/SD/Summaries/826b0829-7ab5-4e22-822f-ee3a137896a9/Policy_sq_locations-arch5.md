# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Scope and aim
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Recognises data governance responsibilities across CS partners.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (via Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Locations must be confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality protects scientific sampling integrity, environment protection, and future surveying permissions.
- Decisions and requests are handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release and precision levels (what can be released)
- Users may identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (country, county, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location identification.
- Six-digit grid references (precise) require CEH pre-processing to avoid release; very exceptional cases may permit external release under licence if IP/data confidentiality is as high or higher.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) can be used to infer square location; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.

## Licensing and conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained after project completion for other purposes.
- End-of-licence reporting: provide written confirmation that data remained secure and was destroyed.
- No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality; no use to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same IP confidentiality level as six-digit releases; a clause prevents attempts to deduce precise locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; licences require sign-off by a senior authorised official.
- If a release is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications for access, decisions, and grounds.
- Internal pre-processing support to CS partners is encouraged within reasonable timeframes; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid as negotiated.

## Practical guidance for data stewards
- Govern access with formal licences, clearly defined project scopes, and time-bounded permissions.
- Maintain a secure data handling environment and track who has access.
- Document decisions and justifications for releases to support accountability and future audits.
- Facilitate pre-processing by CEH to minimise unnecessary disclosures.
- Communicate with CEH early to align on requirements, risk, and compliance expectations.
