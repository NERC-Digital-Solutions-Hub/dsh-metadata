# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Overview
  - Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) from its origin in 1978 through updates up to CS2007.
  - The framework is tightly linked to the ITE (Institute of Terrestrial Ecology) Land Classification, which provides an environmental stratification to ensure representative sampling across Great Britain.
  - Emphasizes the importance of stratified random sampling to avoid bias and to enable robust national, regional, and country-specific estimates of habitat and land-use features.

- Core concepts: stratification and the ITE Land Classification
  - Stratified sampling: divides land into discrete strata (land classes) to ensure all parts of the population are sampled and to reduce sampling bias.
  - ITE Land Classification: originally developed in the 1970s from environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) and derived from the Indicator Species Analysis method, scaled from 1 km squares (with adjacent squares added for context in early surveys).
  - Initial outcome: 32 land classes identified from 1228 centre squares; five additional surrounding squares were included for each centre, yielding a total sample framework of 6039 km squares classified.

- Survey history and evolution
  - CS1978 (initial survey)
    - Sampling: 8 squares per land class, total 256 squares.
    - National estimates calculated as: mean habitat area per square within a land class × total area of that land class.
  - CS1984 (second field survey)
    - Sampling: 12 squares per class, total 384 squares (expanded from 256).
    - National estimates still anchored to the 1978 Land Classification.
  - CS1990 (all-squares land classification; third field survey)
    - Land Classification expanded to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Added the first linkage to a Land Cover Map from satellite imagery; national estimates based on the 1990 classification.
    - Some squares reclassified; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - CS2000 (development of a new land classification; fourth field survey)
    - Need for regional and country-specific estimates (Scotland, England, Wales) identified.
    - Land Classification revised to enable separate country reporting; 40 strata created (class sub-division and aggregation implemented).
    - Additional sample adjustments: more squares to ensure representation of new classes; upland habitat sampling module added to improve upland estimates; Wales received more Welsh-specific squares due to devolution.
  - CS2007 (further refinement for Wales-only reporting; fifth field survey)
    - Welsh-only reporting requirements prompted sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions (creating 45 strata, with 43 extra squares in Wales to ensure minimum representation per Welsh class).
    - England adjustments: some classes had reduced numbers of squares (two classes with 4 squares each) but deemed adequate for reporting purposes.
    - England, Wales, Scotland combined sampling map adjusted accordingly; total squares and sampling rates updated per country.

- Separate country estimates and upland module
  - Separate country estimates: England & Wales vs Scotland reporting required adjustments to sampling design, including sub-dividing and aggregating land classes by country unit and adding new squares to ensure adequate representation.
  - Wales emphasis: introduction of five new Wales-specific sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increased Welsh sampling to at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - Uplands module: CS2000 added an upland survey component (30 additional squares) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales, funded by relevant governmental bodies.

- Summary of sampling framework and outputs
  - Overall GB sampling evolution moved from a 32-class framework (1978) to expanded classifications (up to 45 classes by 2007) with country-specific subdivisions to support England, Wales, and Scotland reporting.
  - Across surveys, the approach remained: stratified random sampling of 1 km squares within land classes, with the aim of deriving accurate national and country-level habitat and land-use statistics.
  - The document provides detailed tables (e.g., counts of squares per class and per country for CS2000 and CS2007) and figures showing the land class maps and sample distributions, illustrating how the sampling framework was adapted over time to meet policy and reporting needs.

- Appendix: brief history of the ITE Land Classification
  - Outlines the historical development of the Land Classification from the 1970s through 2007, including
    - initial creation of 32 classes based on a subset of classified squares,
    - expansion to 40+ classes to accommodate Scotland and later Wales reporting,
    - methodological shifts to classify all GB squares using surrogate factors when full data were impractical,
    - ongoing refinements to support national and regional reporting and ecological assessment.

- Key takeaway for analysts
  - The Countryside Survey sampling strategy is a long-running, policy-driven, stratified sampling framework anchored in a dynamic environmental land-classification system.
  - It evolves to ensure robust, country-specific habitat and land-use estimates, while balancing sample sizes, representation across land classes, and the practical constraints of data collection and classification updates.
