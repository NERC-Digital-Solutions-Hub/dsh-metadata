# Notes on the downloadable data

- Location confidentiality: To preserve representativeness of the wider countryside, precise CS survey square locations are kept confidential by CEH; no external user access at precision finer than 100 square kilometres, so you cannot determine whether squares fall within defined areas below this threshold.
- Data structure: Countryside Survey field data come from a sample of 1 km squares across GB. Each selected square is mapped and measured at two levels (the square as a whole and features within the square). Measurements include a mix of binary and continuous variables.
- Sampling design: The CS sample is not a random subset of all GB squares; it is stratified by the ITE Land Classification. Country-specific classifications exist (England: 21 classes, Wales: 8, Scotland: 16). The classification has evolved from 32 classes (original) to 42 (1998) to 45 (2007) due to separate country reporting.
- Representativeness and exclusions: Estimates must account for stratification; analyses that ignore stratification may be biased. Some squares were excluded from field survey if their area was >90% sea or >75% urban. The survey estimates are therefore representative only of the included squares, with extrapolations made under the assumption that vegetative land in excluded squares resembles that in sampled squares.
- Implications for mapping: Because of the confidentiality and the exclusion criteria, users mapping CS data should be aware of potential biases in areas with high sea/urban coverage and the limitations on precise location-based queries below 100 km2 resolution.
- Estimation and uncertainty: Official estimates are produced via ratio estimation by land class, weighting by vegetative land area in each class. Since 1998, standard errors and confidence intervals are estimated using bootstrap methods to address skewness.
