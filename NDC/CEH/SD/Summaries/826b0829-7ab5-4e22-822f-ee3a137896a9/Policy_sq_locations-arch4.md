# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Policy aims to maximise public-interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey sites.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Defra
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Locations are confidential to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality safeguards the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Requests for information handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release and precision levels
- Access may help identify whether any survey squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location identification.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) may be released only in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing analyses to avoid release.
- Spatial data within survey squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
- Any release must align with licence terms and confidentiality protections.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmed at the end of the licensing period.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; data cannot be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.
- Licensees may need to provide evidence of JCOP-level project management standards.
- Four-digit releases have lower IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases and include a clause preventing attempts to derive precise locations.
- If in doubt, consult CEH before using data covered by this policy.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows the relevant Act and Regulations to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH should, subject to moderate demand, provide pre-processing support to CS partners; requests from other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data under this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Implications for data leaders
- Governance: establishes a formal access, licensing, and confidentiality framework for sensitive location data.
- Risk management: explicit controls to protect landowner goodwill and sampling integrity; stipulations on destruction and non-use for visits or compliance checks.
- Data requirements: need for secure storage, access controls, and documented provenance.
- Collaboration: mandates coordination with CEH/NERC and potential across partners; case-by-case evaluation for external requests.
- Operational planning: incorporate pre-processing capabilities and clear use-case scoping to minimize need for precise location releases.
