# Notes on the downloadable data

- Privacy: The precise locations of Countryside Survey (CS) squares are kept confidential by CEH; external users cannot identify squares with precision finer than 100 square km, limiting location-based identification within defined areas below this threshold.
- Sampling design: CS field survey data come from a sample of 1 km squares in GB, with two levels of sampling (the whole square and within-square measurements) and multiple measurement types (binary to continuous). The sample is not a random subset but a stratified sample defined by the ITE Land Classification, with country-specific classifications (England: 21 classes, Wales: 8, Scotland: 16) and changes over time.
- Exclusions and representativeness: Not all GB squares were surveyed; squares that are >90% sea or >75% urban were excluded. Official GB estimates are derived by ratio estimates for land classes, weighted by vegetative land area. Extrapolations to wider regions assume similarity between excluded and included squares, which may introduce bias in regions with higher sea or urban proportions.
- Estimation and uncertainty: Since 1998, standard errors and confidence intervals have been estimated using bootstrap methods due to skewness in some features, in addition to ratio-estimation techniques.
- Practical implications for users: Analyses must account for the stratified design and exclusions; interpretation should consider potential biases from the sampling frame and the use of bootstrap-based uncertainty estimates. The documentation references foundational methodological sources for sampling and bootstrap techniques.
