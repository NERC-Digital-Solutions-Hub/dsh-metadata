# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documentation of the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Built as the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification, which underpins the stratified sampling framework across GB.
  - Emphasises how the sampling framework is derived from prior years and why changes matter for national and country-specific estimates.

- Core concept: stratified, random sampling using the ITE Land Classification
  - To avoid bias and ensure representativeness, samples are drawn from defined land classes (strata) rather than purely at random.
  - Land Classes describe environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) and, later, land use/habitat features.
  - A centre-square approach (1 km) and surrounding squares were used in early surveys to build a robust stratification system.

- Evolution of the Land Classification and sampling framework (timeline)
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st field survey)
    - ISA-based classification into 32 land classes from 1 km squares (1228 centre squares classified; plus 4 surrounding squares per centre).
    - Sampling: 8 squares per class, total 256; field work on vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
  - 1984 (2nd field survey)
    - Sampling extended to 12 squares per class (384 total); framework retained from 1978 with expanded focus on land use and habitat mapping.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd field survey)
    - Land Classification expanded to cover all 1 km squares in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Incorporation of a Land Cover Map from satellite data; urban/sea corrections applied.
    - Reclassification meant only partial correspondence with earlier classes (about 62%); justification for regionally consistent estimates.
  - 2000 (CS2000; 4th field survey)
    - Need for separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and better regional accuracy identified.
    - Land Classification extended and subdivided to enable country-specific outputs (40 strata total after subdivisions).
    - Country-unit approach implemented: class sub-divisions and aggregations to ensure representation within each country; 19 additional squares added, plus 11 more to balance England/Wales sampling rates.
    - Uplands module introduced: 30 extra squares in upland/marginal upland classes to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007; 5th field survey)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements driven by devolved policy needs.
    - Wales received additional Welsh-class sub-divisions (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
    - 43 extra Welsh squares allocated to ensure minimum representation in each Welsh class; England adjustments kept at minimal loss of precision (some English classes reduced to 4 squares).
    - Revised maps and sampling framework published to reflect England, Wales, and Scotland.

- Details of sampling design and data governance
  - Strata and sampling rates
    - Each survey uses a stratified sampling frame based on Land Classes, with the sampling rate (1:x) indicating the number of GB squares per sample square; rates vary by class and year.
    - CS2000 expanded to 40–45 strata (depending on country adjustments) with targeted minimum squares per class per country.
  - Country-specific estimates
    - Post-CS1990, country units (England & Wales, Scotland) were recognized as distinct outputs; CS2000 implemented country-focused class subdivisions and aggregations to support England & Wales and Scotland reporting.
    - Wales required additional sampling and Welsh-class subdivisions to produce robust Wales-only estimates.
  - Uplands module (CS2000)
    - Additional sampling targeted upland habitats to improve accuracy of country-level upland estimates.
  - Data consistency and note on national estimates
    - Changing the underlying Land Classification affects consistency of stock estimates; national GB estimates are best generated using the most recent classification per survey, with careful cross-walking to older classifications when necessary.
  - Outputs and maps
    - Figures/maps illustrate revised Land Class distributions and survey square locations for each survey year (CS2000 and CS2007). Tables summarize square counts and sampling rates by class and country.
  - Data management implications for data leaders
    - The Land Classification has evolved (32 → 40 → 45+ classes); maintaining metadata, versioning, and crosswalks between classifications is essential for longitudinal analyses.
    - When producing historical vs. current national estimates, explicit documentation of the classification version used is critical.
    - Separate country outputs require clear documentation of class subdivisions and sample allocations by country.
