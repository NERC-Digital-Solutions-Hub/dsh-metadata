# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Provides the field survey sampling framework used for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification (ITE LC), a hierarchical environmental stratification developed over 30 years to ensure representative sampling across Great Britain.
  - Understanding the evolution of the LC is essential to interpret time-series data and national estimates.

- Core approach
  - Use stratified random sampling (strata defined by the ITE Land Classification) to minimize bias and ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
  - Survey a fixed number of 1 km squares within each land-class strata, then extrapolate to national estimates of habitat areas.
  - Produce data products (maps, tables, summaries) to enable end-users to explore changes and derive policy-relevant insights.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification (key transitions)
  - 1978 (Initial LC)
    - 32 land classes derived from environmental variables using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on 1228 centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid (plus surrounding squares).
    - Final sampling: eight 1 km squares per class (256 total) for national habitat estimates.
  - 1984 (2nd field survey)
    - Expanded sampling to 12 km squares per land class (384 total).
    - National estimates still based on the 1978 LC.
  - 1990 (All Squares LC; 3rd field survey)
    - LC updated to classify all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; continued use of LC-based sampling for national estimates.
  - 1990–2000 (LC refinements; regional/local needs)
    - GB-wide LC developed to classify every square, using surrogates for climatic/geological/physiographic factors.
    - Comparisons with the 1978 LC showed about 62% exact correspondence; most mismatches were to neighboring classes, preserving average class characteristics.
    - Result: national estimates still feasible but with redistribution of class representation; introduced need for separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales).
  - 2000 (CS2000; separate country estimates)
    - To support country-specific reporting, LC classes were subdivided into country-unit versions (England with Wales, Scotland), creating 40 strata.
    - Added squares to ensure adequate representation of new/changed classes; some classes redistributed across countries.
    - Additional uplands module included to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Wales-focused reporting)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further LC adjustments: five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an expanded total of 45 strata.
    - Wales received 43 extra squares; minimum of six squares per Welsh class; some English classes retained at four squares per class due to precision trade-offs.
    - England, Wales, and Scotland maps/sampling frameworks updated accordingly.

- Survey design and data collection details
  - 1978: 256 squares surveyed (8 per LC class); foundational national estimates based on mean habitat area per square multiplied by land-class area.
  - 1984: 384 squares surveyed (12 per LC class); continued use of 1978 LC for national estimates.
  - 1990 CS1990: 508 squares surveyed; LC revised to include all GB squares; land-cover data linked; partial urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 2000 CS2000: expanded to enable England/Wales and Scotland country-unit estimates; added uplands module; total class count increased to 40.
  - 2007 CS2007: further Wales-oriented sub-division and 45 strata; Wales has enhanced representation; some English classes reduced in square counts but overall precision deemed acceptable for reporting.

- National estimates and comparability
  - Note: Changing the basic LC used for national estimates affects historical comparisons and consistency of stock estimates.
  - Preference for using the latest, country-specific LC when estimating within a survey, while recognizing cross-survey consistency issues.
  - Table 4 in the document outlines the number of squares per class across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 to illustrate how sample structure evolved.

- Outputs and application
  - Land Class-based sampling underpins national habitat area estimates and habitat change statistics.
  - Outputs include class maps, distribution of sample squares, and calculations of habitat areas by class and country unit.
  - The framework supports policy needs, local and regional reporting, and Wales/England/Scotland-specific environmental assessments.

- Summary of scope and scale (across surveys)
  - Tracking the progression from 32 LC classes (1978) to 45 LC classes (CS2007) and increasingly country-specific strata.
  - Growth in total sampled squares from 256 (1978) to hundreds per country in later surveys; introduction of upland-focused sampling and Wales-focused subdivisions to meet policy and reporting needs.
  - National estimates are derived by combining per-square habitat metrics with class-area proportions, with careful attention to changes in classification and country-specific reporting requirements.
