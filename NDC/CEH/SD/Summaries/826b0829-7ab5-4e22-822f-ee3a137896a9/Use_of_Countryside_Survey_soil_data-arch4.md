# Sampling design

- Purpose and scope
  - Document describes soil sampling conducted in the Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to all 591 CS squares, with some measurements not made on every sample.
  - Power analyses were performed to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (refer to Emmett et al. 2008).

- Study design and sampling framework
  - Sampling locations are CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 x-plots randomly spaced.
  - x-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses, soil types, etc.
  - Plot relocation occurred over time due to land use changes, permission issues, or uncertainty in original locations.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating square 2, repeat plot 1; same identifier used for samples from the same location, though exact sampling points shift ~2–3 m around a 2m x 2m plot.

- Sampling protocol
  - Soil samples collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998/2007 used a soil core hammered into the ground; 1978 used a soil pit with sampling from the top 15 cm side of the pit.
  - Full core collection sometimes not possible due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores sampled (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and data availability
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (see Table 1 in the report).
  - Measurement approach: samples are homogenised before pH and LOI analyses; bulk density measured in 2007 (not via ISO method due to core constraints).
  - Data coverage: measurements reported for either all 591 squares or the original 256 squares, depending on the variable.
  - Table 1 (summary) lists various measurements by core type (e.g., pH, LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, depth of organic layer, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, etc.).
  - Some data (marked with asterisks) are released only after the Soils Report published November 2009.

- Statistical analysis and data interpretation guidance
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock/change of the population, while including them yields weighted national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not universally applied across all analyses; when applicable, use mixed models with square as a random factor to reflect multiple x-plots within each CS square.
  - For CS design-based approaches where spatial structure is not the main interest, a dispersed set of observations can increase regional precision and coverage.
  - Users should consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation and review related CS publications listed on the CS website.

- Data limitations, governance, and access notes
  - Not all measurements are available for all years or all squares; plot relocations introduce location uncertainty.
  - Variation in sampling methods across years and core subsets affects comparability.
  - Some data are only released after publication (Soils Report 2009), so access may depend on publication status.
  - The document directs users to the CEH and CS publications for methodological details and data interpretation guidelines.
