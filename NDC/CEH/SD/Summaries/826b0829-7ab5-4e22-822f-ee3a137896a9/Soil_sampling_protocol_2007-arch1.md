# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Electric Cold Box: kept cool by charging while the vehicle is driven; connected to vehicle lighter socket; mains charger provided for accommodation.
- Tools and materials:
  - 2 knives
  - 2 plastic plates
  - Hammer
  - 2 pairs of pliers
  - Mallet
  - Regular trowel
  - Notebook & pen
  - Long thin trowel
  - Parcel tape
  - Spare cores
  - 1 pack for the appropriate square containing:
    - X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags
    - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Sampling plan:
  - Cores taken approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot of every square.
  - If problems or comments arise (e.g., large roots), note in the envelope and move to a more homogeneous location; record problem.
  - If vegetation or obstacles affect sampling, shift minimum distance and record reason.
- Core collection procedure (per core):
  - Use the correct labelled bag; locate the 4 cores and 4 sample bags.
  - Clear surface vegetation; insert pipe upright; cut bottom edge if needed.
  - Push pipe into ground until upright; place grey plastic plate on top and hammer until the core is level with soil surface.
  - If insufficient depth, move sampling point; record accordingly.
  - If pipe breaks/distorts, use a spare pipe.
  - Remove pipe carefully to avoid losing soil; scrape exterior; trim bottom end if needed.
  - Repeat for each centre quadrat in each X-plot (five sampling locations per square).
- Core types and locations:
  - Core C: BLACK 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter — located 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner (use black core for distance reference).
  - Core F: SHORT WHITE 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter — located 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact.
  - Core N: LONG WHITE 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter — located 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner).
  - Core P: LONG GREY 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter — located 15 cm west of the black core; orientation must be right way up with bevelled end on the surface.
- Composite soil sample:
  - 120 squares only; one composite sample per square filling a plastic bag to the top white panel.
  - 8–10 sub-samples taken with the long thin trowel along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, spaced evenly around the sides.
  - If needed, take additional sub-samples until the bag is full; seal and place into the appropriate bag.

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Storage after collection:
  - Core C (BLACK): store in its bag; once all black cores for a square are collected, store together in a spare bag; keep in a cardboard box in the vehicle, cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to the regional coordinator.
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): place in its bag with other F cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples, place in mailbag for CEH Lancaster and post promptly.
  - Core P (GREY): place in its bag with other P cores; store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples, place in mailbag for CEH Lancaster and post promptly.
  - Core N (WHITE): place in its bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples, place in mailbag for CEH Bangor and post promptly.
  - Soil Sample Bag: place in the cool box immediately; then mail to CEH Lancaster.
- Posting guidelines:
  - Post samples as soon as possible.
  - If last post on Thursday is missed, place in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday.
  - Do not post on Fridays.
  - If local post boxes cannot accept packages, use a convenient Post Office; refer to OS map data or Road Atlas to locate Post Offices.
