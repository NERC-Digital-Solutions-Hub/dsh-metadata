# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Describes the sampling framework and land classification evolution used in Countryside Survey field work through 2007.
  - Builds on three decades of linked time-series data; methodology is designed to ensure representative, unbiased ecological sampling across Great Britain.
  - Central concept: stratified, random sampling guided by the ITE Land Classification to support map-based data products and regional/national habitat estimates.

- Core concepts and development of the ITE Land Classification
  - Early approach (1970s): classify land using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) rather than just species; derive land classes to stratify sampling.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to group quadrats by vegetation, scaled up to landscape levels for national surveys.
  - Land Classification timeline:
    - 1978: First GB-wide classification with 32 classes, based on 1 km squares (centre of 15x15 km grid) and surrounding squares; 8 samples per class (256 total) for field survey.
    - 1984: Land use focus; sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total).
    - 1990: All GB squares classified; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; 508 squares surveyed; retained earlier features plus vegetation quadrats.
    - 1998: Revised classification increases to 40 classes to enable separate Scottish reporting; methodology adjusted as computing power allows broader classification.
    - 2007: Further revisions to accommodate Wales-only reporting; introduces country-unit subdivisions and additional Welsh squares; total becomes 45 classes with Wales-specific sub-classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).

- Sampling framework evolution (CS1978 to CS2007)
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - 256 squares sampled (8 per class) from 32 Land Classes.
    - National estimates derived by applying mean habitat areas per class to the land area of each class.
  - CS1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - 12 squares per class (384 total); used CS1978 classification for national estimates.
  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification)
    - Classification updated to cover all 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Repeated vegetation quadrats; links to first land-cover mapping.
  - CS2000 (Separate country estimates)
    - Recognized the need for England & Wales vs Scotland reporting.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata created; additional squares added to ensure representation.
    - Included a dedicated uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland England/Wales.
    - Wales received more targeted sampling (up to about 64 Welsh squares previously; expanded in 2000).
  - CS2007 (Welsh-only reporting and Wales-specific refinements)
    - Wales-specific class subdivisions created (five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added; ensures minimum representation in each Welsh class.
    - England adjustments: no Welsh-square equivalents added; two English classes (5e, 15e) end with 4 squares per class.
    - Uplands module retained; Wales-focused sampling enhanced for policy/reporting needs.

- Data structure, reporting, and national estimates
  - CS2000 and CS2007 tables show per-class and per-country sample counts and sampling rates (e.g., England, Scotland, Wales).
  - National estimates discussion highlights: changing the underlying Land Classification affects cross-survey comparability; preferred approach is to use the latest country-specific classification for consistency within a survey, while cross-survey consistency may favor original classifications.
  - Note: The document includes detailed tables and figures about sample square counts, strata areas, and sampling rates by class and country.

- Applications and implications for GIS and map-based data
  - Land Classification maps form the backbone of sampling strata, enabling spatially explicit habitat area estimation and change analysis.
  - Framework supports generation of policy-relevant, country-specific habitat status and change maps for England, Scotland, and Wales.
  - Time-series continuity is balanced with the need for country-specific reporting; data packaging and classification changes are carefully documented to support GIS users in mapping and trend analysis.

- Endnotes and references
  - Acknowledgments and extensive references documenting method development, data synthesis, and historical context.
  - The document also provides a concise historical summary of the ITE Land Classification evolution and its application to Countryside Survey through 2007.

- Key takeaways for GIS specialists
  - The Countryside Survey relies on a stratified, random sampling framework anchored in a progressively refined ITE Land Classification to produce robust, map-ready habitat estimates.
  - From 1978 to 2007, classifications expanded from 32 to 45 classes and incorporated country-specific subdivisions to enable Wales- and Scotland-only reporting.
  - Data products derived from this framework support spatial visualization of habitat types, change detection, and policy-oriented analyses across England, Scotland, and Wales, with explicit documentation of any cross-survey classification changes to aid GIS reproducibility.
