# Sampling design

- Overview
  - Soils were sampled in three survey years: 1978, 1998, and 2007. In 1978 and 1998 the same 256 squares were sampled; in 2007 soils were collected from all 591 CS squares, but not all measurements were made on every sample. Power analyses were used to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - x-plots within a square are not replicates (they may sit in different land uses or soil types).
  - Some plots are relocated over time due to destruction, access, or relocation uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Samples from the same unique identifier are from the same location, though exact sampling points are typically 2–3 m apart within a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

- Sampling design details
  - Depths: top 15 cm of the soil profile sampled (8 cm for the invertebrate sample).
  - 1998 and 2007 used multiple cores from each x-plot; different cores carried different measurements.
  - 1978 used a soil pit with sampling from the top 15 cm; some soils prevented full core collection due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, some cores had additional measurements (core photos and measurements of core dimensions) for a subset of cores.

- Measurements and data types
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990 onward: some soil mapping; multiple cores per x-plot with varying measurements (Table 1).
  - Homogenisation before pH and LOI measurements; bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO core method).
  - Table 1 (examples of measurements across cores): pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photograph, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and others.
  - Data coverage: measurements differ by square and by which x-plots were sampled (e.g., some measurements taken for all 591 squares; others only for a subset like the original 256 squares or 2 of the 5 x-plots in each original square).
  - Data release notes: some data marked with an asterisk indicate data released only after the Soils Report (November 2009).

- Data coverage and availability
  - All 591 CS squares had measurements such as pH (and LOI) for certain variables; some measurements were limited to the original 256 squares or to 2 of the 5 x-plots.
  - The dataset contains both widely available variables and restricted data that were released later (post-2009) in the Soils Report.
  - The CS2007 data table clarifies which measurements were made on which cores and across which squares/plots.

- Statistical analysis considerations
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock/change estimates of the population rather than national estimates weighted by land classes.
  - Bootstrapping is not always used; the recommended approach is to use a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within each square.
  - Design-based approaches are appropriate where spatial structure is not of primary interest; broader regional estimates benefit from dispersed sampling to improve precision and coverage.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review existing CS publications that exploit the data (listed on the CS website).

- Guidance for data users
  - Be mindful of the varying data availability across years, squares, and x-plots.
  - Consider the non-replicate nature of x-plots within squares and potential relocation when interpreting results.
  - Verify which measurements are available for the specific squares/plots of interest, including any post-2009 data releases.
