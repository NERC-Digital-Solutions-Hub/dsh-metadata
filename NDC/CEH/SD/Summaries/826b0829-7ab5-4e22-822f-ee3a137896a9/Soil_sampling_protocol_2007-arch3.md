# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Purpose: Standardized setup for soil core sampling and subsequent shipping to laboratories.
- Key items:
  - Electric Cold Box (cooling via vehicle lighter socket) and mains charger for accommodation use
  - Field tools: 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs of pliers, mallet, regular and long thin trowels, parcel tape
  - Documentation and packaging: notebook & pen, spare cores, 1 pack for each X-plot with labelled bags and mailbags for 5 X-plots
  - Data/communication: X-plot packs with cores and labelled bags, stamped & addressed mailbags

## Soil core samples (A1.1.2)

- Sampling locations:
  - Core C (Black): 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat
  - Core F (Short White): 15 cm east of Core C
  - Core N (Long White): 15 cm south of Core C (total 30 cm from south corner)
  - Core P (Long Grey): 15 cm west of Core C
- Core collection procedure:
  - Clear vegetation, cut around soil surface with knife
  - Insert pipe upright, cut bottom edge if needed
  - Push pipe into ground until upright; place grey plate on top and hammer to level with surface
  - If insufficient soil depth or obstacles, move sampling point and record issue
  - If pipe deforms, use a spare pipe
  - Extract pipe carefully to avoid soil loss; use trowel if needed
  - Clean exterior of pipe and cap ends before sealing in bags
- Core specifics:
  - Core C: 15 cm x 5 cm diameter (Black)
  - Core F: 8 cm x 4 cm diameter (Short White); leave litter layer intact
  - Core N: 15 cm x 4 cm diameter (Long White)
  - Core P: 15 cm x 4 cm diameter (Long Grey); orientation with bevelled end on soil surface
- Volume sampling (SQID): 120 squares total; 8–10 sub-samples per composite sample via long thin trowel along quadrat boundary; combine into one plastic bag up to top white panel
- Problem handling: note any issues (e.g., unusual vegetation, cow pat, boulder) in envelope

## Soil sample storage and dispatch (A1.1.4)

- Core-specific storage:
  - Core C (Black): bagged; stored with other black cores in a spare bag; kept cool and out of direct sunlight until sent to regional coordinator
  - Core F (Short White): bagged together with other short white cores; stored in cool box; post in CEH Lancaster mailbag when all five samples are collected
  - Core P (Grey): bagged with other long grey cores; stored in cool box; post to CEH Lancaster
  - Core N (White): bagged with other long grey cores; stored in cool box; post to CEH Bangor
- General sample handling:
  - All soil samples placed in cool box immediately after collection
  - Post samples as soon as possible; if last post Thursday is missed, use weekend storage and post Monday
  - Do not post on Fridays
  - If post boxes are unsuitable, use a convenient Post Office; consult OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Office locations

## Data and governance implications for monitoring frameworks

- Ensures standardized, repeatable data collection across plots, enabling comparability over time
- Emphasizes meticulous labeling, packaging, and chain-of-custody through dedicated mailbags and regional dispatch points
- Addresses data quality concerns by detailing controlled storage (cool box), timely posting, and documented handling of anomalies
- Facilitates data provenance and traceability, supporting transparent reporting and future decision-making in environmental monitoring programs
