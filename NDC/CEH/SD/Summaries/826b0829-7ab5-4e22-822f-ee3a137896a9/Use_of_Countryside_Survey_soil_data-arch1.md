# Sampling design

- Objective and scope
  - Documentation of soil sampling design for Countryside Survey (CS) across three years: 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - Power analyses conducted to determine sample sizes needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sampling framework and periods
  - 1978 and 1998: same 256 CS squares sampled.
  - 2007: all 591 CS squares sampled, though not all cores/measures were performed on every sample.

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots within each CS square.
  - Each CS square contains 5 x-plots; x-plots are not replicates due to differing land uses, soils, etc.
  - Repeat locations have unique identifiers (e.g., 2RPT1: square 2, repeat plot 1).
  - Sampling locations may be relocated if a plot is destroyed, access denied, or uncertainty about original location.
  - Sampling locations are within permanently marked 2m x 2m plots, with exact sampling within 2–3 m around corners.

- Sampling methodology
  - Depth: top 15 cm sampled in 1998/2007; 8 cm for invertebrate sample.
  - Methods:
    - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot; cores may have different measurements.
    - 1978: soil pit used to sample top 15 cm.
  - Practical constraints: some soils too stony or shallow to collect a full core; 2007 included core photographs and detailed measurements for some cores (2 of 4 cores).

- Measurements and data coverage
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot; measurements vary by core.
  - Handling of samples: no chemical analyses by soil horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
  - 2007: bulk density measured (not using ISO full-core method); table of measurements includes:
    - pH (in water and CaCl2)
    - %C and %N
    - Bulk density
    - Core dimensions
    - Photograph, depth of organic layer
    - Hand texture, soil moisture
    - Olsen P, metals
    - Mineralisable N
  - Spatial coverage:
    - 1978/1998: measurements limited to original 256 squares.
    - 2007: measurements across all 591 squares; some measurements restricted to a subset (e.g., 2 of 5 x-plots for certain measurements).
  - Data release notes: some data marked with an asterisk indicate measurements released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).

- Data handling and statistical considerations
  - Analyses should consider land class structure; ignoring it yields stock and change of the population rather than national estimates.
  - When land classes are accounted for, results are weighted by land classes to give national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping not consistently used across analyses.
  - Recommended approach: use mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within each CS square.
  - Design implications:
    - CS is a design-based program where spatial structure is not the primary interest; dispersed sampling improves regional precision and coverage.
    - For regional estimates, broad, dispersed sampling is advantageous.
  - Guidance for analysts:
    - Consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation.
    - Review CS publications and the CS website for prior analyses and dataset usage.

- Data accessibility and references
  - Primary methodology and design described in Emmett et al. 2008: Countryside Survey Soils 2007 – Method development, power analyses and protocols.
  - Data structure and measurement details are tied to the CS2007 framework and associated publications; full data context available via the CS website and related reports.
