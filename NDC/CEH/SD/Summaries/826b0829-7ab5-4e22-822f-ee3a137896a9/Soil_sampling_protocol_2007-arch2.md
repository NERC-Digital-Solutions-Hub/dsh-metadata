# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Electric Cold Box (kept cool by charging from vehicle lighter socket); mains charger provided for accommodation.
- Field tools and supplies:
  - 2 knives
  - 2 plastic plates
  - Hammer
  - 2 pairs of pliers
  - Mallet
  - Regular trowel
  - Long thin trowel
  - Notebook & pen
  - Parcel tape
  - Spare cores
- Pack contents per square:
  - 1 pack for the appropriate square containing: X-plot packs with cores, end caps, labelled bags
  - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Sampling locations and cores per X-plot:
  - C core (BLACK): 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat.
  - F core (SHORT WHITE): 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm east of the black core; leave the litter layer intact.
  - N core (LONG WHITE): 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner of the centre quadrat).
  - P core (LONG GREY): 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm west of the black core; oriented with bevelled end on the soil surface.
- Sampling scope:
  - 4 cores per X-plot, plus a composite soil sample (one bag) made from 8–10 sub-samples from around the boundary of the 5 m quadrat.
  - 5 soil sampling locations per square (across centre quadrats in each X-plot).
- General procedure:
  - Clear vegetation and surface debris; record any issues (e.g., large roots, cow pat, boulder) in the envelope.
  - Use the pipe to core, keep it upright, and cut the bottom edge as needed.
  - If depth is insufficient or the core is damaged, move the sampling point and note the change.
  - Use grey plastic plate and hammer to level the core with the soil surface; avoid losing soil from bottom/top, especially in sandy soils.
  - If needed, replace broken pipes with spare pipes.
  - After extraction, remove soil from exterior of the pipe, cap ends, and seal in the appropriate bag.
  - Ensure Core P is right way up (bevelled end on soil surface).

- Composite sampling details:
  - Collect 8–10 sub-samples with the long thin trowel, forming a square shape the width of the trowel within the 5 m quadrat.
  - Place subsamples into the composite bag; fill to the top white panel.
  - If insufficient depth, collect more until the bag is full.
  - Seal and place the composite sample in the designated bag.

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Core C (BLACK):
  - Store in its own bag; once all black cores for a square are collected, place together in a spare plastic bag.
  - Store in a cardboard box in the vehicle; keep cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to the regional coordinator.

- Core F (SHORT WHITE):
  - Place in its bag with other short white cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately.
  - After all 5 samples are collected, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post ASAP.

- Core P (GREY):
  - Place in its bag with other long grey cores; store in the cool box immediately.
  - After all 5 samples are collected, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post ASAP.

- Core N (WHITE):
  - Place in its bag with other long grey cores; store in the cool box immediately.
  - After all 5 samples are collected, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Bangor; seal and post ASAP.

- Soil Sample Bag (general sample):
  - Place in the cool box immediately; as soon as possible, post in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post.

- Posting and logistics
  - Post samples as soon as possible.
  - If last post on Thursday is missed, place samples in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday; do not post on Friday.
  - If nearby post boxes cannot accept the packages, use a convenient Post Office.
  - Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Office locations.
