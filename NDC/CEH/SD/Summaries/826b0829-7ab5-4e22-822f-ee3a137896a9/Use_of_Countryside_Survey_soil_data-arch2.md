# Sampling design

- Purpose and design
  - Countryside Survey soils were sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007 to detect changes over time.
  - Power analyses were used to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).
  - Coverage expanded from 256 squares (1978/1998) to all 591 CS squares (2007); not all measurements were made on every sample.

- Sampling framework and location
  - Soils are sampled from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 x-plots.
  - x-plots within a square are not true replicates due to differing land uses and soils.
  - Some plots are relocated over time due to loss of land access or destruction; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating the square and repeat plot.
  - Sampling locations are within a permanently marked 2m x 2m plot, with sampling ~2–3 m apart around the plot corners.

- Sampling method
  - Soils are collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998/2007 used soil cores; 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm.
  - Some soils prevented full core collection due to stones or shallow depth.
  - Core measurements include photographs and dimensions (notably in 2007 for some cores).

- Measurements and data coverage
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores carry different measurements.
  - Samples are homogenised before pH and LOI analyses; bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO core method).
  - 2007 measurements (across cores) include pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, and other attributes; some measurements were applied to all 591 squares, others limited to original 256 squares.
  - Some data and measurements were released only after publication of the Soils Report (Nov 2009).

- Statistical analysis considerations
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock/change of the population rather than national estimates.
  - If land classes are included, results are weighted to provide national estimates of stock and change.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; the CS design suggests a mixed-model approach with square as a random factor to capture multiple x-plots per square.
  - Design-based CS emphasizes dispersed placement of samples for regional precision; when spatial structure is not the primary interest, broad dispersion increases efficiency.
  - Users should consult CEH prior to analysis and review existing CS publications exploiting the data (listed on the CS website).

- Practical notes for analysts
  - The dataset supports long-term, national-scale monitoring with varying measurement sets across years; careful harmonisation is required for cross-year comparisons.
  - Data availability and measurement scope differ by year and square; check the CS website and Emmett et al. (2008) for methodological details.
