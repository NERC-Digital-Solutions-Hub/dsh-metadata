# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
  - Policy relates only to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveying.
  - Confidentiality sustains the ability to inform environmental policy.

- Circumstances for release and precision levels
  - Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
  - Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; requester must show that their data/IP carries equal or higher confidentiality; CEH may process instead of releasing raw locations.
  - Spatial data inside survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality to location data and follow the same exceptional-release terms.

- Conditions of release and licensing terms
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to designated individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite, project-specific; data must not be retained for other duties after the licensing period ends.
  - Post-project: written confirmation of data destruction.
  - No data or derived information may be shared with third parties that could compromise square locations; avoid enabling visits or landowner compliance checks.
  - Licensees may need evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have lower IP-security requirements than six-digit releases; 4-digit and spatial data releases must include clauses preventing locating squares from the data.
  - Requests must not be used to deduce exact locations or claim to have done so.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; signatories must have authority from licensee organisations.
  - If access is denied, CEH will follow statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report summarising licence applications and decision justifications to CS partners.
  - CEH aims to enable reasonable pre-processing analyses within moderate demand; other requests are handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH may provide scientific guidance, with collaboration or payment negotiated case-by-case.

- Practical guidance for GIS professionals
  - Plan data requests and processing to minimise exposure of precise locations.
  - Use four-digit grid references where possible; avoid triggering the need for six-digit details unless absolutely necessary.
  - Ensure licences are in place, specify project scope, and adhere to data destruction and security requirements.
  - Engage with CEH early to define requirements and secure appropriate support.
