# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Overview
- Describes the sampling design, site structure, measurement approaches, and statistical considerations for soils within the Countryside Survey (CS) 2007.
- Highlights that power analyses were used to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (based on Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sampling design and site structure
- Soils were sampled in 1978 and 1998 on the same 256 squares; in 2007, samples were collected from all 591 CS squares.
- Each CS square contains five x-plots; x-plots are not replicates due to varying land use and soil types within a square.
- Some x-plots or plots were relocated over time due to destruction, access restrictions, or uncertainty in location; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Within a permanently marked 2m x 2m plot, sampling points are approximately 2–3 m apart at the four corners.
- Sampling design emphasizes broad spatial coverage to support regional estimates, with dispersion within squares enhancing precision.

## Sampling methods and depth
- Soils sampled from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples) using a soil core in 1998 and 2007; 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm.
- In 1998 and 2007, multiple cores were taken per x-plot; some cores have different measurements.
- Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were recorded in 2007 for some cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

## Measurements and laboratory analyses
- 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; various measurements applied to different cores.
- No chemical analyses by soil horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method due to practical constraints).
- A full description of methods and implications is provided in Emmett et al. 2008.
- Measurements reported include: pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, texture (hand textured), soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, etc.
- Data availability varied: some measurements were taken across all 591 squares, others only for the original 256 squares; several data items released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).

## Data structure and statistical analysis
- Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land class can bias stock/change estimates.
- Weighting by land classes can yield national estimates; bootstrapping was not always used.
- Recommended approach: use a mixed model with square as a random factor to reflect the nesting of up to five x-plots within each CS square.
- Design-based inference notes: CS emphasizes dispersed observations to maximize regional precision and coverage; spatial structure is not typically the primary focus.
- Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review existing CS publications using the data (listed on the CS website).

## Data governance, accessibility, and limitations
- Some measurements and data were restricted for release until after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).
- Metadata completeness and data provenance are critical; some datasets required contacting originators to verify metadata or fill gaps.
- The need for data quality assurance, transformation, and clear presentation (reports, charts, dashboards) is emphasized.
- Sharing underlying data is encouraged but may be limited by governance and openness standards.

## Implications for monitoring framework authors
- Design monitoring with explicit power analyses to determine sample size and sampling intensity aimed at detecting meaningful change.
- Use a hierarchical sampling structure (plots within squares) and document non-replicate nature of within-square plots to avoid misinterpretation.
- Collect and manage multiple core measurements per location; track core-specific measurements and ensure consistent laboratory methods and metadata.
- Prepare comprehensive metadata from the outset; plan for data sharing, governance, and release timelines (including potential embargoes).
- Account for land class structure in analyses; apply mixed models with appropriate random effects to reflect sampling design.
- Prioritize data quality assurance, documentation, and clear communication of findings; provide guidance to users on data provenance and limitations.
- Maintain accessibility of publications and data via a central catalog (e.g., CS website) to support reuse and cross-study comparisons.
