# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

- Overview
  - Documents the evolution of the Sampling Strategy and the ITE Land Classification used to stratify a national field survey of Britain's countryside from 1978 through 2007.
  - Emphasises the link between methodological development and the policy/monitoring needs that drive separate country reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and UK-wide outputs.
  - Highlights how stratification, data quality, and transparent, repeatable procedures support robust national estimates of habitat and land-use features.

- Core concepts and rationale
  - Use of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation across Great Britain.
  - Stratified, random sampling to reduce bias and improve precision; stratification mirrors ecological variation across land classes.
  - Field sampling units are 1 km squares; sampling relies on a centre square plus surrounding squares to capture local variability.
  - Land classification is built from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) rather than solely on species data, enabling broad, repeatable strata.

- Development timeline and key developments
  - The Beginning (early 1970s)
    - Concept of national ecological sampling using stratified, objective (random) sampling.
    - Basis for the ITE Land Classification and its rationale for stratified sampling across GB.
  - The Sampling Framework for CS1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used on environmental variables to create 32 land classes from 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid).
    - Each centre square classified; surrounding four squares also allocated to classes; total of 6,039 km squares classified.
    - 8 squares per land class surveyed (256 total); national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class multiplied by the class’s land area.
  - The 1984 CS1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (384 total); built on the 1978 framework.
  - The CS1990 Project (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all 1 km squares in GB; urban/sea corrections added.
    - 508 squares surveyed; replication of 1978 vegetation data plus new measurements.
    - Outputs used original 1990 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - Developments for CS2000 (Fourth Land Classification & Fifth Field Survey)
    - Recognised the need for regional estimates and separate reporting for England, Scotland, Wales.
    - Land Classification extended so every GB square could be classified; best surrogates used when full data weren’t available.
    - Introduced separate country estimates by subdividing classes into “country unit” versions and aggregating where necessary to maintain representation.
    - Extra sampling to ensure adequate representation of new classes; Wales received targeted sampling increases; Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates.
    - A dedicated uplands module (30 additional squares) added to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.
  - CS2007 (Fifth Field Survey & Wales-focused adjustments)
    - Addressed Wales-only reporting needs post-devolution; introduced Welsh-specific class subdivisions (five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expanded class count to 45 strata.
    - Additional Welsh sampling (43 extra squares) to ensure at least 6 squares in each Welsh class; some English classes reduced in sampling in light of Wales’ stronger representation.
    - England adjustments: two English classes (5e, 15e) left with 4 squares per class due to Wales-focused strengthening; overall precision deemed acceptable.
  - Outputs and mapping
    - CS1990 main report (1993) used the 1990 Land Classification.
    - CS2000 UK results (2000) used country-unit classifications with expanded country-specific sampling.
    - CS2007 UK results (2008) delivered under the refined, Wales-focused, country-unit framework.

- Sampling design and implementation details
  - Stratified sampling using ITE Land Classes as strata to ensure coverage of land-use and habitat diversity.
  - Centre-square approach: classification based on the centre 1 km square and inclusion of surrounding four squares to capture local heterogeneity.
  - Land Class evolution: from 32 classes (1978) to 40 classes (1990) to 45 classes (2000) to 45 strata with country-unit subdivisions (2007), enabling Wales- and Scotland-specific reporting.
  - Country-unit estimates
    - England with Wales and Scotland reported separately after adjusting class definitions and adding/removing squares to achieve adequate representation per country.
    - Isle of Man squares no longer contribute to country-unit estimates; replacements allocated elsewhere.
  - Wales upland focus
    - Upland/h marginal habitat sampling expanded to improve reliability of Welsh upland estimates.
  - Class subdivisions and aggregation
    - Sub-dividing Land Classes into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) created more localized strata (40 → 45).
    - Aggregation used where necessary to maintain meaningful representation within each country.

- Data, outputs, and interpretation
  - National estimates derive from the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - Country-specific reporting influences: use of country-unit classifications and tailored sampling to yield England & Wales and Scotland estimates that reflect national policy needs.
  - Consistency considerations
    - The 2006 scoping study noted that changing the basic classification used for national estimates affects GB-wide consistency; two approaches exist: use the latest country-specific classification or maintain the original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency. Preference is given to the latest classification for country-specific estimates.

- Enduring reflections and governance
  - The strategy emphasizes repeatability, transparency, and alignment with environmental policy needs.
  - The need to balance data richness with metadata, data governance, and representativeness across regions and devolved administrations.
