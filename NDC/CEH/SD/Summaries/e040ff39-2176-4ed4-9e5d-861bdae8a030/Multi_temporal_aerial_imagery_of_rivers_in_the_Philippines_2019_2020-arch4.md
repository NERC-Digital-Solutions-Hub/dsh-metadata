# Data overview

- Purpose and scope
  - High-resolution aerial imagery resource of two riverscapes in the Philippines (0.2 m spatial resolution)
  - Collected in 2019 and 2020 to enable multitemporal analysis of changes; useful for tropical river management applications

- Sites and survey design
  - Two Luzon island river segments: downstream Bislak River and the confluence of Abuan, Bintacan, and Pinacanauan de Ilagan (Ilagan)
  - Sites selected to monitor hydrometeorological hazards such as flooding and bank migration
  - Survey platform: ALTM Pegasus LIDAR with D8900 aerial camera on a Cessna T206H RP-C9122
  - Flight planning: blocks flown at 750-800 m above ground level with 20-40% scan overlap
  - Timing: flights scheduled for low-flow conditions to enhance dry topography exposure and minimize cloud shadow/sun-glint
  - Survey dates: Bislak (2019-03-21; 2020-01-22); Ilagan (2019-04-05; 2020-02-14)

- Aerial image processing and output
  - Processing workflow: colour corrections (Capture One, Adobe Lightroom), tie-point definition, colour points and selection shapes, and rectification (TerraPhoto)
  - Output: orthoimagery with spectral RGB information at 0.20 m resolution, using WGS 84 / UTM Zone 51N
  - Image values: RGB bands scaled 0-255 (8-bit)

- Data structure and quality assurance
  - Quality control: positional accuracy verified by the third party responsible for the surveys

- Relevance for data strategy and governance (Data Leaders perspective)
  - Provides a multi-temporal, high-resolution, well-documented data asset suitable for integration into broader datasets and data products
  - Clear metadata on scope, methods, coordinate system, and file structure enhances discoverability and reusability
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: acquisition planning, quality-controlled processing, and organized archival naming
  - Supports analytical, presentation, and dissemination practices through ready-to-use orthoimagery for monitoring river dynamics and hazard assessment
  - Highlights importance of data provenance, third-party quality checks, and standardized outputs for effective data stewardship in a networked data ecosystem
