# Data overview

- This data resource contains high-resolution aerial imagery (0.2 m spatial resolution) of two riverscapes in the Philippines, collected in 2019 and 2020 to enable multitemporal change detection. It supports diverse tropical river management applications.
- Sites are on Luzon island: (i) downstream segment of the Bislak River; (ii) the Ilagan confluence of the Abuan, Bintacan and Pinacanauan de Ilagan Rivers. Both are prone to hydrometeorological hazards such as flooding and bank migration.
- The imagery is suitable for identifying changes in river morphology, bank line position, and topographic exposure over time.

## Survey details

- Sensor setup: ALTM Pegasus LIDAR system with a D8900 aerial camera, mounted on a Cessna T206H RP-C9122.
- Flight planning: blocks flown at 750–800 m above ground level (AGL) with 20–40% overlap per scan to maximise data coverage and efficiency.
- Timing: surveys conducted during low-flow conditions to maximise exposure of dry topography and to minimise cloud shadow and sun-glint.

## Aerial survey dates

- Bislak: 21 March 2019
- Bislak: 22 January 2020
- Ilagan: 5 April 2019
- Ilagan: 14 February 2020

## Aerial image processing and output

- Processing steps: colour corrections (RGB balance, intensity, saturation, contrast) using Capture One and Adobe Lightroom; 8-bit TIFF outputs; tie-point definition (5–10 images, ≥5 points per image); colour points and selection shapes; rectification via TerraPhoto to produce a single RGB image with 0.20 m resolution.
- Coordinate system: WGS 84 / UTM Zone 51N.
- Value scaling: RGB bands scaled 0–255.
