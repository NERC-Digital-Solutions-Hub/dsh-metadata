# Supporting documentation

- The document documents a simulation study of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the Sunjia catchment, Jinaxi province, Southeast China, using a pool-based ECOSSE model over two years (2014 and 2015) with daily SOC and soil N outputs across soil layers and daily fluxes.
- Observations and inputs come from the Sunjia Critical Zone Observatory (CZO): 50 ha site, crops peanut (50%) and citrus (17%), kaolinitic red clay soil, subtropical climate with a distinct rainy season.
- Climate and soil data inputs were collected onsite: hourly weather (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind) and potential evapotranspiration (Penman–Monteith) from a single monitoring station; soil measurements at depth intervals (0.05, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 m) across five points per crop type, including bulk density, C, and N contents, averaged for model input.
- Model structure: ECOSSE pool-based decomposition with base rates modified by drivers; outputs represent turnover and fluxes for soil carbon and nitrogen; simulated to a depth of 3 m (entire soil profile) with results in kg/ha except available water (mm).
- Outputs and units: daily time step with variables such as decomposable plant material (dpm_c_kg/ha), recalcitrant plant material (rpm_c_kg/ha), biomass carbon (bio_c_kg/ha), humus (hum_c_kg/ha), total soil organic carbon (total_soc_kg/ha), CO2 emitted (co2_c_kg/ha), total soil organic nitrogen (total_son_kg/ha), inorganic N forms (nh4_n_kg/ha, no3_n_kg/ha), denitrified_n_kg/ha, nitrification_n_kg/ha, N2O emissions (n2o_n_kg/ha), nitric oxide (no_n_kg/ha), and available water in soil (avail_water_mm).
- Data file and documentation: Short_SIM.csv contains outputs from a short simulation of carbon turnover in a smaller catchment; document notes data quality checks, including checks for missing or incorrect input data.
- Quality and provenance: Input files underwent basic quality control to identify missing or incorrect data; clear traceability from Sunjia CZO measurements to ECOSSE model inputs and outputs.
