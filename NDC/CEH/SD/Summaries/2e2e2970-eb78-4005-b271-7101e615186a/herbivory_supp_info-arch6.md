# Overview of herbivory occurrence and herbivory intensity in exotic Clidemia hirta and native Melastoma spp. plants along two transects in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo

- Objective and scope
  - Measured herbivory occurrence and herbivory intensity on exotic Clidemia hirta and native Melastoma spp. across two 100 m transects at each of 21 sites within RSPO-certified oil palm landscapes in Sabah.
  - Aimed to capture variation along a disturbance gradient (forest edge vs forest interior) and among sites with varying canopy cover and habitat structure.
  - Additional measurements: number of reproductive organs per plant and various habitat-related variables.

- Study species
  - Exotic: Clidemia hirta (invasive Melastomataceae).
  - Native comparison: Melastoma spp., with most encountered likely Melastoma malabathricum.
  - Field identification of Melastoma spp. can be challenging due to morphology and hybridization.

- Study sites and design
  - 21 forest sites embedded within oil palm-dominated landscapes in Sabah.
  - Each site surveyed two habitats: forest-oil palm edge (disturbed) and forest interior (less disturbed).
  - Across sites, 39 transects were analyzed (some interior transects excluded due to steepness or lack of C. hirta).
  - Within each transect, up to 10 C. hirta plants were sampled; nearest Melastoma plant (if present) was also surveyed.
  - Plants selected were taller than 30 cm to ensure sufficient leaf material.

- Herbivory measurements
  - Occurrence: proportion of damaged leaves per plant (damaged leaves/total leaves).
  - Intensity: assessed on the first four fully expanded leaves from the shoot apex; all leaves scanned within six hours and damage estimated by eye to the nearest 10%, then middle category values used as continuous scores (e.g., 0, 1, 3.5, 7.5, 15%).
  - By-eye method used to integrate multiple damage sources (insects, pathogens, etc.) and to avoid re-creating leaf margins for image analysis.
  - Reproductive fitness: counts of buds, flowers, immature fruits, and ripe fruits per plant for C. hirta and Melastoma spp.

- Other variables collected
  - Local proximity and interactions: distance to nearest Melastoma plant; herbivory rate on that plant.
  - Habitat and light: habitat type (edge vs interior), local canopy cover (five points per transect; taken with a densiometer), and transect-wide mean canopy cover.
  - Plant size and density: total number of leaves per C. hirta plant; local density of C. hirta within 5 m of focal plant; presence/absence of C. hirta in 1 m segments along the transect.
  - Disturbance gradient: edge vs interior habitat to capture canopy and light variation.
  - SLA and leaf traits: Specific Leaf Area (SLA) measured in oil palm roads, edge, disturbed forest interior, and intact forest; leaves scanned for area, then dried and weighed to compute SLA.

- SLA data and leaf trait measurements
  - SLA.csv contains leaf area and SLA measurements for four leaves per plant, across four habitat types (Oil palm, Forest-oil palm edge, Disturbed forest, Intact forest).
  - Data include plant and leaf-level metrics: Leaf1-Leaf4_area, Total_leaf_area, Mean_SLA, Total_leaf_weight, etc.
  - Plant codes and habitat coding are provided, with some differences noted between herbivory and SLA datasets.

- Data files and contents
  - herbivory_habitat.csv: herbivory measurements for exotic Clidemia hirta and native Melastoma spp. across sites and habitats; includes herbivory occurrence, intensity, reproductive organs, and related plant/habitat variables.
  - herbivory_local.csv: per-plant pair data linking focal Clidemia hirta plants with nearest Melastoma spp. plants; includes survey date, site, habitat, exact transect position, local densities, canopy cover, plant codes, leaf-level herbivory metrics, and reproduction data.
  - SLA.csv: leaf-area and SLA measurements for Clidemia hirta across four habitat types; includes plant codes, leaf areas, total/mean SLA, and weights.

- Data quality and quality control
  - Consistent data collection by the same observers for canopy cover and herbivory intensity categorization to minimize observer bias.
  - Data checked for errors and cleaned accordingly.
  - Field methodology aligned with established protocols and cited literature.

- Units and data interpretation
  - Herbivory occurrence: proportion (0–1 or 0–100%); herbivory intensity: percentage area damaged per leaf, captured as a continuous variable after categorization.
  - Canopy cover: percentage (0–100%) per measurement point and transect mean.
  - SLA: cm2 g-1 (leaf area per gram dry mass).
  - Reproductive organs: counts per plant.
  - Densities: counts per transect segment or per plant, as defined in the datasets.

- How the data can be used
  - Comparative analyses of herbivory patterns between an invasive species and a native congener under different disturbance and light conditions.
  - Investigation of how canopy cover, edge effects, plant density, and proximity to Melastoma spp. influence herbivory intensity and occurrence.
  - Exploration of relationships between herbivory and reproductive output for invasive vs native species.
  - Integration with SLA and leaf trait data to assess trait-mediated herbivory responses across habitats.
