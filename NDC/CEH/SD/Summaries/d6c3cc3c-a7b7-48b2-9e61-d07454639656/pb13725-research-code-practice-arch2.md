# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Overview
- Provides a framework for proper conduct of research funded by multiple UK bodies (Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, Devolved Administrations, BBSRC, NERC).
- Balances quality of the research process (QP) with quality of the science (QS); stresses fitness for purpose, rigorous, auditable procedures, and competent, trained researchers.
- Compliance is driven from the top of funded organisations and may involve risk assessments, site-specific controls, and third-party audits.

## Background
- Developed by representatives from major funding and overseeing bodies; endorsed by UK devolved administrations and several agencies.
- Launched in May 2003; effect from 1 June 2004.
- Joint QA audits by UKAS began in 2006 to assess projects post-1 June 2004; findings led to revisions.
- Applicable to all funded research and to work in institutes funded by BBSRC and NERC; intended to be read with the principle of fitness for purpose.

## Principles behind the Code
- Contractors must commit to:
  - Quality of the research process (QP)
  - Quality of the science (QS)
- QS covers project aims, approaches, and knowledge extraction.
- QP ensures processes are appropriate, rigorous, repeatable, and auditable; without QP, findings are less credible.
- Emphasis on “best scientific practice” from project start; compliance should be driven by leadership.
- Research should be diligently conducted by competent, adequately trained people.

## Compliance with the Code
- Agencies require acceptance of the Code when proposals are submitted (or discuss deemed inappropriate clauses).
- Records of discussions may become terms and conditions; formal risk assessments may be requested.
- Contractors are responsible for compliance by their staff and any subcontractors.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director is required.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code
- Organisations should have policies/processes to ensure ongoing compliance and should ideally be audited by an impartial third party against internationally recognised standards.
- The Funding Bodies may obtain evidence of compliance, including independent audits of a contractor’s research system.

## Specific requirements of the Code

### 1. Responsibilities
- Contractor organisations own the overall quality of research and compliance with in-house policies.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors promote good scientific practice and skill development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader is accountable for all project work, including subcontractors; clear responsibilities must be defined for all staff.

### 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent to perform required tasks; training must be supervised to prevent compromising results.
- Contractors must provide documented evidence of capability and training records showing awareness of JCoPR provisions.

### 3. Project planning
- Conduct appropriate risk assessments to gauge factors influencing success.
- Produce a written project plan addressing research design, statistical methods, etc.; agree plans with the Funding Body and consider ethical/licensing requirements.
- Schedule regular reviews of timetables; significant amendments must be pre-approved.

### 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned processes to assure research quality; subject projects to regular fit-for-purpose reviews.
- Outputs require authorisation as agreed with the Funding Body; notify and address post-publication errors promptly.
- Continuous improvement through regular review of processes.

### 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with applicable health and safety regulations.

### 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Label, track, and retain samples/materials with storage conditions defined in the project plan.
- Ensure traceability through analysis and disposal routes.

### 7. Facilities and equipment
- Maintain a safe, high-quality working environment; regular checks of special facilities (e.g., fume cabinets).
- Calibrate and maintain equipment; have contingency plans for critical systems.
- Establish standard operating procedures for critical equipment.

### 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- Document all procedures and methods, including analytical and statistical methods, with audit trails and version control.
- Validate methods as fit for purpose; trace modifications through development.

### 9. Research / work records
- Maintain high-quality project records enabling repetition of work.
- Project Leader ensures validity via regular staff record reviews.
- Retain critical data and records securely and with traceability for a period defined with the Funding Body.

### 10. Field-based research
- Comply with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimise pollution risks.
- Apply all JCoPR provisions to field work.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence

- 4. Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews, internal audits and corrective actions, publication approval policy.
- 5. Health & safety: training/compliance documentation (e.g., Health & Safety Plan), measures for hazardous materials.
- 6. Handling of samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures, storage logs.
- 7. Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records, regular facility maintenance, SOPs for critical equipment.
- 8. Documentation & methods: robust document/version control, validated SOPs.
- 9. Research/work records: counter-signed lab notebooks or indexed data files, archiving procedures.
