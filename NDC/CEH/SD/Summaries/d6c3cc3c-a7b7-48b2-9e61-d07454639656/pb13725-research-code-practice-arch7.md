# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Overview
- A framework for proper conduct of funded research across multiple UK bodies.
- Emphasises fitness for purpose, quality of the research process (QP) and the quality of the science (QS).
- Applies to all types of research funded by the listed organisations; launched in 2003/2004 and revised since.
- Contractors must ensure compliance and undertake risk assessment, with potential third-party audits.

## Principles
- Commit to QP (process quality) and QS (scientific quality).
- Aim for best scientific practice from project start; ensure researchers are competent and adequately trained.
- Compliance should be driven from the top of funded organisations.

## Compliance and Monitoring
- Contractors indicate acceptance of the Code when submitting proposals.
- Discussion of inapplicable clauses is encouraged; risk assessments may be required.
- Acceptance for BBSRC/NERC-funded work is provided annually by the Institute Director.
- Funding Bodies may audit contractor systems; third-party audits may be conducted to verify compliance.

## 1. Responsibilities
- Contractor organisation is responsible for overall research quality and adherence to policies.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors foster good scientific practice and skill development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader is responsible for all work, including subcontractors; clear roles for all staff.

## 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; training must be supervised to ensure quality.
- Contractors must provide documented evidence of capability; maintain training records acknowledging Code compliance.

## 3. Project planning
- Perform appropriate risk assessment to anticipate factors affecting success.
- Maintain a clear, written project plan considering design, methods, and ethical/licensing requirements; agree with the Funding Body.
- Schedule regular plan reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.

## 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes.
- Outputs require authorisation by the Funding Body and senior-level approval where appropriate.
- Notify and address errors post-publication; pursue continual improvement.

## 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with applicable health and safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Label samples clearly, accurately, and durably; retain for an agreed period.
- Storage and handling must be defined in the project plan; monitor critical conditions.
- Track samples through analysis/use; designate disposal routes and dates.

## 7. Facilities and equipment
- Create a safe, appropriate working environment; maintain equipment and facilities.
- Calibrate and maintain equipment; ensure contingency plans for disruptions.
- Have standard operating procedures for critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- Document all procedures and methods; maintain clear audit trails, version control, and linkage to primary data.
- Validate methods as fit for purpose; trace modifications through development.

## 9. Research / work records
- Records must be detailed enough to reproduce work.
- Project Leader supervises regular reviews of staff records.
- Retain critical data and records with integrity and security; specify retention period with the Funding Body.

## 10. Field-based research
- Comply with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution risks.
- Apply all JCoPR provisions to field activities.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence
- Responsibilities: organisation chart, personnel lists, subcontractor agreements, roles, and responsibilities.
- Personnel competence: CVs, training records, compliance awareness.
- Project planning: risk assessments, timetable reviews, approved plans, validated procedures, ethical approvals.
- Quality Control: internal audit records, fit-for-purpose reviews, publication authorization.
- Health & safety: training/compliance documentation (e.g., H&S plan), item-specific measures.
- Handling samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures, storage logs.
- Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records, SOPs, emergency procedures.
- Documentation of procedures & methods: robust document/version control, validated SOPs.
- Research/work records: counter-signed lab notebooks or indexed data, consistent archiving.
- Field-based research: documented risk assessments for field activities.

## Implications for GIS data projects
- Ensures GIS data products have traceable provenance from collection to map outputs.
- Enforces rigorous data cleaning, validation, and documentation of GIS processing steps.
- Requires clear data management plans, version control, and audit trails for spatial datasets.
- Promotes risk assessment and project planning in geospatial analyses and map-based reporting.
- Mandates training and competence for personnel handling GIS data, analyses, and sub-contractors.
- Demands robust retention, security, and accessibility of project data and supporting records.
