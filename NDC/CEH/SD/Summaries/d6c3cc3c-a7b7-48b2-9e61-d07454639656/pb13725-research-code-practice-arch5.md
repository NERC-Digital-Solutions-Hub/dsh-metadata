# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A framework for proper conduct of research funded by a group of UK public bodies (Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, Devolved Administrations, BBSRC, NERC) to ensure quality of research processes (QP) and quality of science (QS), with “fitness for purpose” as the overarching principle
- Emphasises best scientific practice from the start, top-level ownership of compliance, and continual improvement through documented processes and audits

## Background and scope
- Originated from BBSRC, Defra, FSA, and NERC; endorsed by NI, Scotland, Wales; also endorsed by APHA, Fera, FC, MMO, NE, VMD
- Launched May 2003; effective June 1, 2004; UKAS audits of funded projects began in 2006
- Applies to all research funded by the listed bodies; aims to be applicable across research types, with fitness-for-purpose as the guiding principle
- Revisions made after audit findings and stakeholder input; guidance now includes documentary evidence requirements

## Principles behind the Code
- Focus on two linked quality dimensions:
  - Quality of the research process (QP): rigorous, repeatable, auditable procedures
  - Quality of the science (QS): aims, approaches, knowledge extraction
- Contractors must demonstrate competence, diligent conduct, and adherence to best practices
- Compliance is expected to be driven by senior leadership within funded organisations

## Compliance with the Code
- Acceptance: Contractors indicate acceptance in funding applications; discussions possible about clauses deemed inappropriate; discussions and compliance become part of funding terms
- Responsibility: Contractors ensure project compliance and that subcontractors follow the Code
- Annual acceptance: For BBSRC- and NERC-funded work, Institute Director must provide annual acceptance

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code
- Purpose: ensure policies and processes exist and are consistently applied
- Bodies may require formal assurance through auditing against internationally recognised standards
- UKAS audit programme demonstrated the monitoring approach; funding bodies reserve the right to obtain evidence or conduct independent audits

## 1. Responsibilities
- Contractor organisation owns overall research quality and policy compliance
- Managers and supervisors foster good scientific practice
- Principal Investigator/Project Leader is responsible for all project work, including subcontractors
- Clear, documented responsibilities for all staff and students

## 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks
- Training provided under supervision to avoid compromising results
- Documented evidence of capability and awareness of Code provisions

## 3. Project planning
- Conduct appropriate risk assessment to identify project factors affecting success
- Produce a written project plan addressing design, statistics, ethical/licensing considerations
- Plans must be agreed with the Funding Body; schedule regular reviews; major amendments require pre-approval

## 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes
- Outputs authorized by the Funding Body or senior management
- Notify and correct post-publication errors promptly
- Regularly review processes as part of continual improvement

## 5. Health and Safety
- Compliance with all relevant health and safety regulations

## 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Clear, durable labeling; accurate tracking; retention period agreed with Funding Body
- Storage conditions specified and monitored if critical
- Clear disposal routes and timelines for samples and materials

## 7. Facilities and equipment
- Safe, appropriate working environment; regular maintenance of facilities (e.g., fume cupboards)
- Equipment calibrated at appropriate intervals; contingency plans for disruptions
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- All procedures and methods documented with audit trails and version control
- Validation of methods to ensure fit-for-purpose status; traceability of modifications

## 9. Research / work records
- Records must be detailed enough to allow replication
- Regular reviews by Project Leader; secure, retrievable storage; clear retention periods

## 10. Field-based research
- Compliance with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimise pollution
- All general JCoPR provisions apply to fieldwork

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence
- Demonstrates how to document compliance across categories:
  - Responsibilities: organogram, personnel lists, sub-contractor agreements, defined roles
  - Competence: CVs, training records, awareness of Code
  - Project planning: risk assessments, updated plans, milestone records, statistical validation, ethical approvals
  - Quality Control: internal review procedures, audits, corrective actions, publication policy
  - Health & Safety: training records, safety plans, material-specific measures
  - Handling of samples: standardized labeling, procedures, storage logs
  - Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records, SOPs, emergency procedures
  - Documentation of methods: version control, validated SOPs
  - Records: counter-signed/notebook equivalents, secure archiving
  - Field-based research: risk assessments for field work

This summary highlights how the Joint Code of Practice for Research interfaces with data governance responsibilities, emphasizing documented procedures, data integrity, traceability, risk management, and auditability that Data Stewards must enforce across large-scale datasets and research programs.
