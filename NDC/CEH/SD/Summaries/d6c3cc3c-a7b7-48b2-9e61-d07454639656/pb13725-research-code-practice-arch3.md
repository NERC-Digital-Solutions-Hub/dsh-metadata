# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A framework for the proper conduct of funded research across multiple UK bodies to ensure fitness for purpose, quality of the research process, and quality of science.
- Emphasises two linked aims: quality of the process (QP) and quality of the science (QS), with top-level commitment from funded organisations.

## Overview and scope
- Applies to research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, and to BBSRC/NERC-funded work in their institutes.
- Introduced in 2004; revised post-audit to reflect findings. Aims to be read with the principle of fitness for purpose.
- Endorsed by multiple UK government bodies and agencies; intended to apply to all research types funded under these bodies.

## Core principles
- Contractors must pursue best scientific practice from the outset.
- Compliance is driven from the top of funded organisations.
- Emphasises fitness for purpose, competence, and adequate training.

## Compliance and monitoring
- Contractors indicate acceptance of the Code when submitting research proposals.
- Possible formal risk assessment to identify additional controls.
- Contractors are responsible for ensuring projects and subcontractors comply with the Code.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, Institute Director must annually confirm acceptance.
- Monitoring may include formal third-party audits to assure quality systems are fit for purpose.

## Specific requirements

### 1. Responsibilities
- The contractor organisation holds overall quality responsibility for research and internal policies.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors promote good scientific practice.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader is accountable for all project work, including subcontractors.

### 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; trainees must be supervised appropriately.
- Contractors must provide evidence of personnel competence and maintain training records.

### 3. Project planning
- Conduct risk assessments to identify factors affecting success.
- Maintain a clear, written project plan addressing design, statistics, and ethics/licences.
- Plans should be agreed with the Funding Body; regular reviews and updates are required; amendments need pre-approval.

### 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned quality assurance processes and conduct fit-for-purpose reviews.
- Outputs require appropriate senior-level approval; post-publication errors must be corrected with the Funding Body.
- Emphasises continual improvement of procedures.

### 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

### 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Clear, durable labeling and tracking of samples/materials; appropriate storage and retention periods.
- Clear disposal routes; critical storage conditions must be monitored and recorded.

### 7. Facilities and equipment
- Safe working environment; regular maintenance of facilities and equipment.
- Equipment must be appropriate, calibrated, and in good condition; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment.

### 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- All procedures must be documented with an auditable trail, including version control.
- Validation of methods as fit for purpose; traceability of changes.

### 9. Research / work records
- Records must enable repetition of work and provide a complete project picture.
- Regular reviews by the Project Leader; secure, traceable storage of records for an agreed retention period.

### 10. Field-based research
- Compliance with environmental legislation and responsible management of discharges/emissions.
- All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based work.

## Annex: Examples of documentary evidence
- Provides concrete evidence types for each requirement, such as:
  - Organisational structure, roles, and responsibility matrices.
  - CVs and training records for personnel.
  - Risk assessments, project plans, milestones, and regulatory approvals.
  - Internal audit records, corrective actions, and publication approvals.
  - Documentation of health and safety plans and specific measures for hazardous materials.
  - Equipment maintenance, calibration records, and SOPs.
  - Document and version control systems, validated SOPs.
  - Archived, counter-signed lab notebooks or indexed electronic data files.
  - Field risk assessments and risk mitigation documentation.

## Endorsements and applicability
- The Code has broad endorsement across UK government departments and agencies and is applicable to research funded by these bodies.
- It establishes accountability and oversight mechanisms, including potential external audits and annual confirmations of acceptance.
