# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A framework to ensure fitness for purpose and best scientific practice across funded research activities.
- Applies to research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, and to BBSRC/NERC work in their institutes; launched 2003, effective from 1 June 2004; revised in light of audits and workshop outputs.
- Emphasizes quality of the research process (QP) and quality of the science (QS); contractors are expected to commit to both from project start and throughout.

## Principles behind the Code

- QP: rigor, repeatability, auditable processes for gathering and interpreting results.
- QS: aims, approaches, and extraction of new knowledge from scientific work.
- Compliance should be driven from the top of funded organizations; “fitness for purpose” guides all provisions.
- Researchers should be competent and adequately trained.

## Compliance with the Code

- Funding bodies require acceptance of the Code in research proposals; discussions on inappropriate or non-applicable clauses may be recorded and become part of funding terms.
- Contractors must ensure projects (and subcontractors) comply with JCoPR.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, Institute Director acceptance is required annually.

## Monitoring of Compliance

- Organisations should have policies/processes to ensure Code compliance; ideally supported by formal systems audited against international standards.
- The funding bodies may audit contractor research systems or request evidence to confirm standard adherence (e.g., via independent audits such as UKAS).

## 1. Responsibilities

- The contractor organization is responsible for overall research quality and policy compliance.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors foster good scientific practice and skill development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader oversees all work, including that of subcontractors; clear responsibilities must be defined and communicated.

## 2. Competence

- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; trainees must be supervised to protect quality.
- Contractors must provide documented evidence of competence and maintain training records.

## 3. Project planning

- Conduct risk assessments to understand factors influencing project success.
- Maintain a clear written project plan addressing design, statistical methods, etc., agreed with the Funding Body.
- Schedule regular plan reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.

## 4. Quality Control

- Planned, formal “fit-for-purpose” reviews of projects; outputs require senior approval where appropriate.
- Notify Funding Body of post-publication errors and initiate corrective actions promptly.
- Regularly review processes for continual improvement.

## 5. Health and Safety

- Full compliance with relevant Health and Safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of samples and materials

- Clear, durable labeling and retention for an agreed period.
- Storage conditions and monitoring described in the project plan; samples tracked through all stages and have defined disposal routes.

## 7. Facilities and equipment

- Safe working environment; regular maintenance of facilities and equipment.
- Equipment calibrated at appropriate intervals; contingency plans for critical systems.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all project-critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods

- All procedures and methods documented with audit trails, version control, and linkages to primary data.
- Validation of methods to ensure they are fit for purpose; traceability of method development.

## 9. Research / work records

- Records must be detailed enough to reproduce work; regular reviews by the Project Leader.
- Clear retention and secure storage of records, with defined location and protection against unauthorized modification.

## 10. Field-based research

- Compliance with environmental legislation; responsible discharge/emission management.
- All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based research where relevant.
