# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Provides a framework to ensure data and research outputs are fit for purpose, high quality, auditable, and reproducible.
- Emphasizes data governance: documentation, version control, audit trails, data and metadata standards, and discoverability.
- Highlights responsibilities across the organisation, including leadership, project planning, risk assessment, and oversight of subcontractors.
- Supports data strategy by promoting formal processes for data handling, storage, retention, and compliance with health, safety, and environment considerations.
- Encourages continual improvement and formal assessments to verify that data and research processes meet required standards.

## Background
- Developed by a group of UK funding and research bodies and endorsed by devolved administrations and several agencies.
- Launched May 2003; effective 1 June 2004; subject to joint audit programs (e.g., UKAS).
- Applies to all research funded by the listed bodies and to research in their institutes; aims for fitness of purpose and best scientific practice.

## Principles behind the Code
- Quality of the research process (QP) and quality of the science (QS) are both essential.
- QS focuses on aims, approaches, and knowledge extraction; QP ensures rigorous, repeatable, auditable processes.
- Contractors must practice best scientific methods from project start; compliance should be driven from organisational leadership.
- Researchers should be competent and adequately trained; activities should be diligently conducted and fit for purpose.

## Compliance with the Code
- Funders may require acceptance of the Code in research proposals; discuss inapplicable clauses with Funders.
- Compliance becomes part of funding terms; contractors must ensure subcontractors adhere to JCoPR.
- For some funders (BBSRC/NERC), annual acceptance by the Institute Director is required.

## Monitoring of Compliance with the Code
- Organisations should have policies to ensure compliance, applied consistently.
- Where possible, assurance should be through formal external audits against recognized standards.
- Funders reserve the right to obtain evidence or conduct independent audits of a contractor’s research system.

## 1. Responsibilities
- Contractor organisation: overall quality and compliance with in-house policies.
- Managers/supervisors: promote good scientific practice and skills development.
- Principal Investigator/Project Leader: responsible for all project work, including subcontractors; clear roles for all staff.

## 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; trainees must be supervised to protect quality.
- Contractors must provide evidence of competence and maintain training records.

## 3. Project Planning
- Conduct appropriate risk assessment; develop a clear written project plan addressing design and methods.
- Plans should be agreed with the Funders and aligned with ethical approvals or licences.
- Schedule regular reviews; major amendments require pre-approval.

## 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes.
- Outputs require senior-level authorization; notify Funders of post-publication errors and take corrective action.
- Regularly review processes as part of continual improvement.

## 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of Samples and Materials
- Labeling must be clear, accurate, durable, and retained according to agreed timelines.
- Storage conditions should be specified and monitored; traceability and disposal routes must be defined.

## 7. Facilities and Equipment
- Work environment must support safe operation and data/sample integrity.
- Equipment must be suitable, calibrated, and maintained; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment should exist.

## 8. Documentation of Procedures and Methods
- All procedures and methods must be documented with an auditable trail and version control.
- Validation of methods should be documented as fit-for-purpose; trace modifications through development.

## 9. Research / Work Records
- Records must be detailed enough to allow replication.
- Regular reviews by the Project Leader; locate and retain records securely and with integrity for the agreed period.

## 10. Field-based Research
- Comply with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimise pollution.
- Apply all JCoPR provisions to field-based work as appropriate.

## Annex – Examples of Documentary Evidence
- Responsibilities: organisation chart, personnel lists, subcontractor agreements, defined roles.
- Personnel competence: CVs, training records, compliance awareness.
- Project planning: risk assessments, updated schedules, approved plans, validation of analyses, ethical approvals.
- Quality control: internal audit records, fit-for-purpose reviews, publication approval processes.
- Health & safety: training and compliance documentation, specific safety measures.
- Handling of samples & materials: standardized labelling, procedures, storage logs.
- Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records, SOPs, emergency procedures.
- Documentation of procedures & methods: version control, validated SOPs.
- Research/work records: counter-signed notebooks or indexed data files, archiving procedures.
- Field-based research: risk assessments for field work.
