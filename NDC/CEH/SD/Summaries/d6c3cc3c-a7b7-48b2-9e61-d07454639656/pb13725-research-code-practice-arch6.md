# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- Sets the framework for proper conduct of research funded by UK bodies, focusing on both the quality of the research process (QP) and the quality of the science (QS).
- Overriding principle: fitness for purpose; research should be diligent, competent, and adequately trained.
- Applies to research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, devolved administrations, and to BBSRC/NERC-funded work in their institutes.

## Key purpose and scope (data support perspective)
- Emphasizes high standards of data handling: auditability, traceability, and reproducibility.
- Encourages robust data management through documented procedures, versioning, and linkage between primary data and processed information.
- Requires risk assessment, project planning, and ongoing review to ensure data-related objectives are met.

## Principles relevant to data and documentation
- Quality of process (QP) and quality of science (QS) as dual aims.
- Data processes should be rigorous, repeatable, auditable, and fit for purpose.
- Top-level commitment to best scientific practice from funded organisations.

## Compliance and governance
- Contractors must indicate acceptance of the Code when submitting proposals; discussions on inappropriate clauses may influence terms and conditions.
- Contractors are responsible for ensuring all staff and subcontractors comply with JCoPR provisions.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director is required.

## Monitoring and assurance
- Organisations should have formal, auditable systems to assure research quality.
- Funding Bodies may audit a contractor’s research system (e.g., via third-party assessment or UKAS-like processes) to verify compliance.
- Policies and processes should be consistently applied across the organisation.

## Responsibilities
- The contractor organisation owns overall research quality and compliance.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors promote good scientific practice.
- Principal Investigator/Project Leader holds responsibility for all project work, including that of subcontractors.

## Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; training must be supervised to avoid compromising results.
- Contractors must provide documented evidence of capability and training records, including awareness of JCoPR obligations.

## Project planning
- Conduct risk assessments to identify factors influencing project success.
- Maintain a clear, written project plan reviewed with the Funding Body; align with ethical approvals or licenses as needed.
- Schedule regular timetable reviews; pre-approve significant plan amendments.

## Quality Control
- Implement fit-for-purpose reviews at appropriate frequencies.
- Output authorization as agreed with the Funding Body; notify and correct post-publication errors promptly.
- Embrace continual improvement through regular review of processes.

## Health and Safety
- Compliance with applicable health and safety regulations for all research activities.

## Handling of samples and materials
- Clear, durable labeling; defined retention periods agreed with the Funding Body.
- Storage conditions monitored when critical; samples tracked through analysis stages with defined disposal routes.

## Facilities and equipment
- Safe working environment; regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
- Contingency plans for disruptions; standard operating procedures for critical equipment.

## Documentation of procedures and methods
- All procedures and methods must be documented with clear audit trails, version control, and linkage to primary data.
- Validation of methods must be documented and traceable through development.

## Research / work records
- Records must be detailed enough to reproduce work; regular reviews by the Project Leader.
- Secure, stored location- and time-tracked records, with integrity protections and appropriate retention.

## Field-based research
- Compliance with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution.
- All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based work as applicable.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence
- Responsibilities: organisation chart; personnel lists; subcontractor agreements; defined roles.
- Personnel competence: CVs; training records; awareness of JCoPR requirements.
- Project planning: risk assessments; revised plans; milestones; statistical validation; ethical approvals.
- Quality Control: internal review procedures; internal audits; publication authorization policies.
- Health & safety: training records; health & safety plans; specific risk measures.
- Handling of samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking; procedures; storage logs.
- Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records; SOPs; emergency procedures.
- Documentation of procedures & methods: document/version control; validated SOPs.
- Research/work records: counter-signed notebooks or indexed data files; archiving procedures.
- Field-based research: documented risk assessments for field activities.
