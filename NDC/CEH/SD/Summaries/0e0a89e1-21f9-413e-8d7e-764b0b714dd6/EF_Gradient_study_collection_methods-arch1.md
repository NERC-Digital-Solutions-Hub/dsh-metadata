# Vegetation work

- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site; visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing the four quadrats.
- Biomass: above-ground material clipped at soil surface from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, weighed, and summed across the site to yield g biomass per m^2.
- Shannon's diversity index calculated (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).
- Community weighted mean (CWM) traits calculated using: CWM = sum(w_i x_i) across species, where w_i is relative abundance and x_i is trait value (Díaz et al. 2007). Traits drawn from trait databases (listed below).

Trait values used (examples):
- longevity (ordinal, 1 = annual to 5 = perennial; LEfDA traitbase)
- plant height (cm; PlantATT)
- specific leaf area (SLA; LEfDA traitbase)
- root architecture (categorical, 7 levels; from tap roots to fibrous)
- rooting depth class (ordinal, 3 levels)
- vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) affinity (ordinal, 3 levels)

Greenhouse gas flux: Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis and respiration

- Four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) embedded in soil; transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA; EGM-4).
- CO2 influx measured over two minutes; a reflective cover placed over the chamber to obtain CO2 efflux in the dark.
- Soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured in triplicate.
- Calculations convert raw CO2 measures (over ~2 minutes) to CO2 flux in mg m^-2 hr^-1; flux assessed for both light and dark conditions.
- CO2 flux over an hour computed from consecutive measurements (details specify time points and constants).

Methane (CH4), CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O)

- Chambers covered in reflective material; 9 mL air collected at 10, 20, and 30 minutes into the measurement period.
- Gas concentrations analysed by Gas-Chromatograph (GC; Agilent 7890B).
- Final gas flux values calculated using the same approach as for IRGA-derived CO2.

Soil sampling

- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger to 10 cm depth; stones/roots removed by 2 mm sieve.
- Samples stored at 5°C until processing.

Bulk density

- Bulk density measured from two cores per site, separated into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths; dried at 80°C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Bulk density calculated as mass/volume.

pH

- pH measured by mixing 5 g fresh soil with an equal volume of Milli-Q water (1:1) and reading with a pH meter (Mettler Toledo FE20 with LE409 probe).

Volumetric moisture content

- Fresh soil weighed (5 ± 0.001 g), dried at 80°C for 48 hours; moisture content calculated as a proportion of wet weight.

Water extractable N and C

- 5 g soil mixed with 25 mL Milli-Q water, shaken 150 rpm for 1 hour, filtered (Whatman No. 1).
- Undiluted filtrate analysed for dissolved inorganic N (DIN: NH4+, NO3-, total N) via autoanalyser with UV digester; DOC analysed with TOC analyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture: DIN/DOC (mg/kg) = (raw value × (water content + extract volume) × dilution factor) / dry weight.

KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation

- 5 g soil with 25 mL 1 M KCl, shaken 150 rpm for 1 hour; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analysed for DIN (NH4+, NO3-) by autoanalyser.
- Extracts adjusted for moisture as above.
- A second 5 g sample incubated at 25°C for 14 days, then extracted and analysed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density / number of days → g m^-2 day^-1.

Microbial biomass

- Fumigation-extraction: 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform for 24 hours to lyse microbial cells; an unfumigated 5 g sample used for comparison.
- Post-lyse extraction with 25 mL 0.5 M K2SO4; filtrate analysed by autoanalyser (DIN, PO4) at appropriate dilutions; dissolved carbon measured by TOC-L.
- Values adjusted for moisture; KE_C and KE_N (extraction efficiency factors) applied (0.35 and 0.54 respectively).
