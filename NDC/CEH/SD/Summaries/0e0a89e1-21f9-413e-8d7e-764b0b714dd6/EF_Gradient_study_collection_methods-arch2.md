# Vegetation work

- Four 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site for sampling.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs summed across the four quadrats.
- Biomass sampled by clipping at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, and weighed; totals summed across the site to yield g biomass m^-2.
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).
- Community weighted mean (CWM) trait values calculated: CWM = sum(w_i × x_i) for S species, where w_i is the relative abundance of species i and x_i is the trait value; traits sourced from trait databases (see below).

- Trait values used include longevity, plant height, specific leaf area, root architecture, rooting depth class, and VAM affinity, drawn from LEDA Plant Traitbase and PlantATT databases, with supporting literature (Díaz et al. 2007; Grime et al. 2007; Hill et al. 2004; Kleyer et al. 2008; Shannon & Weaver 1963).

# Greenhouse gas flux

- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange measured using four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) embedded in the soil and transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA).
- CO2 influx measured over 2 minutes; a reflective cover placed over the chamber for a dark measurement; repeated measurements taken to determine CO2 efflux.
- Concurrent measurements of soil moisture and temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) recorded in triplicate.
- CO2 flux calculated from chamber measurements (raw CO2 change over time) and converted to mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1 using chamber volume, area, and temperature data (including standard constants for unit conversion).
- Methane (CH4), CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O) measured using reflective-chamber gas sampling: 9 mL air collected at 10, 20, and 30 minutes and analyzed by Gas Chromatography (GC); final values calculated using the same approach as CO2 from IRGA data.

# Soil sampling

- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm diameter auger to 10 cm depth where possible.
- Samples sieved to 2 mm to remove stones and roots and stored at 5°C until processing.

# Bulk density

- Bulk density determined from two cores per site, split into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths.
- Soils dried at 80°C for 48 hours after sieving; bulk density calculated as mass per volume.

# pH

- pH measured by mixing 5 g of fresh soil with an equal volume of Milli-Q water (1:1) and using a calibrated pH meter with LE409 probe.

# Volumetric moisture content

- Fresh soil (5 g, to 0.001 g precision) dried at 80°C for 48 hours; moisture content calculated as the ratio of dry to wet weight.

# Water extractable N and C

- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 mL Milli-Q water, shaken 150 rpm for 1 hour, then filtered.
- Filtrate analyzed for Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN: NH4+, NO3-, total N) via autoanalyser and for Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) via TOC analyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture to yield DIN and DOC in mg/kg dry soil.

# KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation

- 5 g soil with 25 mL 1 M KCl shaken for 1 hour; filtrate diluted and analyzed for DIN (NH4+, NO3-) by autoanalyser.
- DIN adjusted for soil moisture (mg/kg) as with water extracts.
- An additional 5 g soil incubated with 25 mL water at 25°C for 14 days; extracted and analysed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ days, reported as g m^-2 day^-1.

# Microbial biomass

- Fumigation-extraction method: 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform to lyse microbes, compared with unfumigated control.
- Post-fumigation and post-extraction solutions treated with 0.5 M K2SO4, filtered, and analyzed (DIN, PO4, and dissolved carbon) using autoanalyser and TOC.
- Values adjusted for water content and extraction efficiency using KE (κ_e) factors: KE C = 0.35 and KEN = 0.54.
