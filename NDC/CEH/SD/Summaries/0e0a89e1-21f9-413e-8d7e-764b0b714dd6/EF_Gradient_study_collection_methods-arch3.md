# Vegetation work

## Overview
A comprehensive field and laboratory protocol to quantify vegetation structure, soil properties, greenhouse gas fluxes, nutrient pools, mineralisation, and microbial biomass across sites. Combines plant community metrics with ecosystem process measurements and uses standardized, replicable procedures and explicit data processing steps.

## Measurements and indicators

### Vegetation metrics
- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
- Species richness and percent cover of grasses and forbs computed by summing quadrats.
- Biomass: clipped at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80 °C for 24 hours, weighed; summed across the site to yield g biomass per m².
- Diversity: Shannon’s Diversity index calculated (Shannon & Weaver 1963).
- Functional traits: Community Weighted Mean (CWM) traits calculated (S = number of species; w_i = relative abundance; x_i = trait value). Traits sourced from databases (see Trait values section).
- Trait data examples (from references):
  - longevity; plant height; specific leaf area; root architecture; rooting depth; mycorrhizal (VAM) affinity.

### Greenhouse gas flux
- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis and respiration:
  - Four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) with transparent chambers connected to an IRGA.
  - CO2 influx measured over 2 minutes; a reflective cover used to obtain dark efflux.
  - Soil moisture, temperature (WET sensor), and PAR measured in triplicate.
  - CO2 flux calculated from changes in CO2 concentration; results expressed as mg CO2 m⁻² h⁻¹.
- Methane (CH4), CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O):
  - Chambers with reflective material; 9 mL air sampled at 10, 20, and 30 minutes.
  - GC (Gas-Chromatograph) used to quantify gases.
  - Final gas flux values calculated using the same framework as CO2 measurements.

### Soil sampling and physical properties
- Six soil samples per site using a 4 cm auger, to a depth of 10 cm; sieved to 2 mm; stored at 5 °C.
- Bulk density: two cores per site; analyzed for 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths; dried at 80 °C for 48 hours; BD = mass/volume.
- pH: 5 g fresh soil mixed with 5 g Milli-Q water (1:1) and measured with a pH meter.

### Moisture and nutrient status
- Volumetric moisture content: 5 g fresh soil dried at 80 °C for 48 hours; moisture calculated from weight change.
- Water extractable N and C (DIN and DOC):
  - 5 g soil with 25 mL Milli-Q water; shaken; filtered.
  - DIN (NH4+, NO3-, total N) by autoanalyser; DOC by TOC analyser.
  - Values adjusted for soil moisture using a specified formula.
- KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation:
  - 5 g soil with 25 mL 1 M KCl; shaken; filtered; diluted; DIN analysed.
  - Soil moisture adjustment applied.
  - A 14-day incubation at 25 °C; samples extracted and analysed as above.
  - Mineralisation calculated as (NO3⁻ + NH4⁺) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m⁻² d⁻¹).

### Microbial biomass
- Fumigation–extraction method:
  - 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform for 24 hours; an unfumigated control sample prepared.
  - Extraction with 25 mL 0.5 M K2SO4; nutrients extracted and analysed (DIN, PO4, dissolved carbon via TOC).
  - Data adjusted for water content; corrections applied using KE (0.35) and KEN (0.54) quotients for extraction efficiency.

## Data management and processing

- Trait values for vegetation are drawn from established databases (e.g., LEDA Traitbase, PlantATT) and literature references.
- All measurements include specific units, depths, and processing steps to ensure traceability and comparability across sites.
- Calculations involve standard formulas for gas fluxes, mineralisation, and moisture/nutrient adjustments, supporting transparent data processing and potential replication.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks

- Provides a multi-maceted suite of measures linking plant community structure and function to soil and ecosystem processes.
- Uses standardized protocols and explicit calculation methods, enabling comparability across sites and time.
- Data types align with typical monitoring outputs: species composition, diversity, biomass, functional traits, greenhouse gas fluxes, soil chemistry, moisture, and microbial biomass.
- Trait and soil data rely on established databases and lab analyses, facilitating integration into broader environmental health assessments.

## Potential considerations for monitoring governance

- Data quality and metadata: the detailed procedural descriptions support data provenance, but systematic metadata (sampling date/time, coordinates, site management, etc.) would be essential for long-term monitoring and data sharing.
- Data access and sharing: while the protocol emphasizes transparency of methods, explicit data sharing or open-data practices are not described and would need to be addressed in a monitoring framework.
- Data standardization: to avoid silos and ensure comparability, harmonization of units, calibration procedures, and lab analyses across sites would be important.
- Timeliness and update frequency: some measurements (e.g., mineralisation over 14 days, gas fluxes) have inherent temporal requirements; scheduling and reporting cadences should be defined for policy-relevant decisions.

## Outputs and key metrics

- Vegetation: species richness, percent cover by life-form, biomass (g m⁻²), Shannon diversity, and CWMs for listed traits.
- GHG fluxes: net CO2 exchange (mg m⁻² h⁻¹), CH4 and N2O fluxes.
- Soils: bulk density, pH, volumetric moisture, extractable N and C (DIN, DOC), mineralisable N, and mineralisation rate (g m⁻² d⁻¹).
- Microbial biomass: fumigated vs unfumigated extraction results, DIN, PO4, dissolved carbon, and KE/KEN-corrected biomass estimates.
