# Vegetation work

## Data collected

- Four random 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats per site for vegetation assessment.
- Visual estimation of percent cover per species; calculation of species richness.
- Percentage cover of grasses and forbs; biomass harvested by clipping at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, and summed across the site to yield g biomass per m^2.
- Community metrics: Shannon's Diversity index; Community Weighted Mean (CWM) traits calculated using the formula: CWM = sum (w_i x_i) where w_i is the relative abundance of species i and x_i is the trait value.
- Trait values drawn from online databases (e.g., LEDA, PlantATT) for listed plant traits.

## Greenhouse gas flux measurements

- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange measured with four 25 cm diameter collars and transparent chambers linked to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA); CO2 influx measured over two minutes, repeated after covering the chamber to obtain dark CO2 efflux.
- Simultaneous measurements of soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in triplicate.
- Calculations convert 27 CO2 measurements per hour to CO2 flux in mg m^-2 hr^-1; formulas incorporate timing, chamber volume, and surface area.
- Methane (CH4), CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O) sampled via reflective chambers placed in collars; 9 mL air samples collected at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes and analyzed with a Gas-Chromatograph.

## Soil sampling and bulk density

- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger to a depth of up to 10 cm; sieved to 2 mm and stored at 5°C.
- Bulk density determined from two cores per site, split into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm, dried at 80°C for 48 hours; BD calculated as mass/volume.

## pH and moisture content

- pH measured by mixing 5 g soil with 5 g Milli-Q water (1:1) and using a calibrated pH meter.
- Volumetric moisture content determined by weighing fresh soil (5 g), drying at 80°C for 48 hours, and comparing pre/post weights.

## Water extractable N and C

- 5 g fresh soil shaken with 25 mL Milli-Q water for 1 hour; filtrate analyzed for DIN (NH4, NO3, total N) using autoanalyser with UV digester and DOC using TOC analyser.
- Outputs adjusted for soil moisture using DIN/DOC mg/kg calculations.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation

- 5 g soil with 25 mL 1 M KCl shaken for 1 hour; filtrate analyzed for DIN (NH4, NO3) after dilution.
- A second 5 g sample incubated at 25°C for 14 days, then extracted and analyzed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ days.

## Microbial biomass

- Microbial biomass determined via fumigation–extraction: fumigated and unfumigated soil extracts via 0.5 M K2SO4; nutrients analyzed by autoanalyser; dissolved carbon measured by TOC.
- Data adjusted for water content and extraction efficiency using KE C (0.35) and KEN (0.54) quotients.

## Data outputs and metrics

- Vegetation: percent cover, species richness, grasses/forbs cover, biomass per m^2, Shannon's Diversity, and CWMs for selected traits.
- GHG: CO2 flux (mg m^-2 hr^-1), CH4, and N2O fluxes from chamber measurements.
- Soils: pH, volumetric moisture content, DIN (NH4, NO3, total N), DOC, extractable N and mineralisation rates, and microbial biomass indicators (DIN, PO4, dissolved carbon) with related KE/KEN adjustments.

## Trait values and data sources

- Traits derived from LEDA Traitbase and PlantATT:
  - Longevity (ordinal, annual to perennial)
  - Plant height (cm)
  - Specific leaf area
  - Root architecture (seven levels, from tap rooted to fibrous)
  - Rooting depth class (three levels)
  - VAM (vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal) affinity (three levels)
- Values and categorisations come from the cited trait databases (Kleyer et al. 2008; Hill et al. 2004; Grime et al. 2007; Hill et al. 2004; etc.).

## Data use and potential products (Data Support perspective)

- Transform raw measurements into user-friendly data products for end users:
  - Dashboards of species composition, richness, and CWMs; time-series of biomass and cover.
  - GHG flux dashboards and summaries by site, season, and environmental conditions.
  - Soil health dashboards showing pH, moisture, N, C, mineralisation, and microbial biomass metrics.
  - Trait-based analyses and summaries to support ecological interpretation and policy decisions.
- Data quality considerations:
  - Standardize units and formats across measurements; document calibration and lab methods.
  - Integrate data from vegetation, gas flux, and soil analyses for cross-cutting ecological insights.
  - Promote outputs and collect feedback to iteratively refine data products and allow broader reuse.
