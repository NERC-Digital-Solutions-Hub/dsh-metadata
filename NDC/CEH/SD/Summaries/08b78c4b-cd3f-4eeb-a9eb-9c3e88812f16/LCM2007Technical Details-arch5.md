# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview
- Provides UK land cover information in both vector and raster formats designed for diverse user needs.
- Detailed data and accompanying documentation exist to support interpretation and use.

## Data Formats and Coverage

### Vector data
- Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes and metadata about derivation.
- Minimum Mapable Unit for land cover parcels: 0.5 ha.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).

### Raster data
- Five raster products available to summarize information.
- 25 x 25 m raster: indicates the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products: summarize the 25 x 25 m raster data.
- Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
- Supply format: GeoTiff.
- Coverage: UK.

## Metadata and Documentation
- Detailed metadata for raster formats is available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Specific tables referenced:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets.

## Governance and Use Considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure data formats (ESRI Shapefile and GeoTiff) align with user needs and portal/catalogue requirements.
- Verify and communicate the attribute definitions and class mappings as described in the dataset documentation (Tables 1–3).
- Manage data provenance and confidence in the mapped units (e.g., 0.5 ha minimum for vector parcels) and scale/resolution (25 m and 1 km rasters).
- Facilitate access to both detailed vector data and summarized raster products to support diverse workflows within UK coverage.
