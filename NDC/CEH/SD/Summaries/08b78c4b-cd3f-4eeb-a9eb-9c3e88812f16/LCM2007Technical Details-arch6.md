# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 is available in multiple formats to suit different user needs.
- Provides both detailed vector data and scalable raster products for UK land cover mapping.

## Data Formats, Scales, and Coverage
- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with descriptive attributes and metadata about derivation.
  - Minimum mappable unit: 0.5 hectare.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: UK.
- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total.
  - 25 x 25 m raster: provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters: summarize the 25 m raster.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
  - Supply format: GeoTIFF.
  - Coverage: UK.

## Documentation and Metadata
- Detailed metadata and definitions available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Tables included:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

## How this Supports Data Use
- Enables data integration by offering both high-detail (vector) and summarized (raster) formats.
- Supports flexible analysis at multiple scales (0.5 ha units; 25 m and 1 km rasters) for self-serve data exploration.
- Metadata and table references aid in validation, cross-walking classifications, and understanding data provenance.
