# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

- The Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is offered in formats designed for different user needs, all covering the UK.

## Data formats

- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel.
  - Attributes describe land cover; metadata explains how the information was derived.
  - Minimum mappable unit: 0.5 hectares.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.

- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total.
  - 25 x 25 m raster: provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters: summarize the 25 x 25 m raster data at a coarser scale.
  - Detailed metadata available for raster formats.
  - Supply format: GeoTIFF.

## Coverage and scales

- Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).
- Scales:
  - 25 m pixel size (for the detailed 25 x 25 m raster).
  - 1 km pixel size (four summary rasters).

## Metadata and documentation

- Detailed information available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation, including:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets.

## Practical considerations for Data Leaders

- Choose format based on use case:
  - Vector for precise boundaries and attribute-level analysis.
  - Raster for broad habitat summaries and scalable analysis.
- Leverage metadata and documentation to assess data derivation, class definitions, and compatibility with existing systems.
- Consider granularity needs (0.5 ha minimum for vector data) and the availability of multiple raster resolutions for aggregation or detailed analysis.
