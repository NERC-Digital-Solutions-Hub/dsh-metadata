# Two vegetation surveys of the 160 ha Monks Wood National Nature Reserve (NNR) in 2005 and 2006

- Purpose and scope
  - Data from two vegetation surveys in Monks Wood NNR (160 ha) conducted in 2005 and 2006 to assess habitat characteristics, originally linked to Marsh Tit territories.
  - Transect locations chosen around Marsh Tit territories and similar-sized unoccupied blocks, effectively sampling across the entire wood.
  - Surveys aim to provide standardized data for environmental monitoring and policy performance over time.

- Study area and sampling design
  - Location: Monks Wood National Nature Reserve, UK grid TL 19877 80075.
  - Each survey used 100 m long transects (10 m wide) distributed across the wood; minimum inter-transect distance 15 m, maximum 159 m, mean 75 m (SD 37 m).
  - 2005: 35 sampling locations; 2006: 34 sampling locations. Centroids of Marsh Tit territories (2004 for 2005; 2006 for 2006) and centroids of unoccupied wood used as transect midpoints.

- Survey methods (year-to-year differences)
  - 2005 (February): Record shrubs >30 cm and trees >1 m tall; trees categorized by DBH (<5 cm, 5–30 cm, >30 cm); shrubs counted as individuals unless dense patches; deadwood not surveyed.
  - 2006 (June–July): Record shrubs >30 cm and trees >1 m tall; trees DBH classes expanded to <10 cm, 10–30 cm, >30 cm; shrubs height classes updated to <2 m, 2–4 m, >4 m; added deadwood categories (fallen and standing) for 10–30 cm and >30 cm DBH; included further deadwood details (snags, branches overhanging transect).
  - Across years, transect centroids and general layout remained comparable, with slight methodological refinements in 2006.

- Data collected and structure
  - Transect-level identifiers: Transect_ID, Year, Transect_ID_Annual, and centroid coordinates (X, Y in British National Grid); transect bearings for the two 50 m segments from centroid.
  - Vegetation data by species and DBH class (2005 vs 2006 adjusted):
    - Species groups include Ash, Aspen, Elm, Field Maple, Oak, Birch, Wild Service, Dogwood, Goat Willow, Grey Sallow, Hawthorn, Hazel, Honeysuckle, Privet, Rose, Deadwood (fallen/standing), with totals and DBH-class-specific counts.
    - DBH-class definitions change between years (e.g., Ash: <5 cm / 5–30 cm / >30 cm in 2005 vs <10 cm / 10–30 cm / >30 cm in 2006; tree totals and overall height thresholds correspondingly aligned).
  - Deadwood details (2006 onward): fallen vs standing deadwood categorized by diameter classes; separate tallies for each species’ deadwood components where applicable.
  - Missing data indicated as no_data.

- Quality control
  - Data records were checked and cleaned; missing values explicitly labeled as no_data to ensure transparency.

- Outputs and use
  - Data designed to be analysed with standardized methods to produce outputs such as environmental health indicators, habitat classification, and transect-level biodiversity metrics.
  - Results are presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and datasets are stored/uploaded to appropriate portals for access and reuse.

- References and data use context
  - Primary reference: Broughton et al. (2006) Marsh Tit Territories in a British Broadleaved Wood.
  - An example of the field recording sheet for 2006 is provided to illustrate data capture formats (dates, centroids, species, DBH categories, and deadwood components).

- Relevance to monitoring objectives
  - Provides standardized, repeatable vegetation metrics across a full woodland landscape.
  - Enables assessment of habitat structure, tree/species composition by size classes, and deadwood components—key indicators of ecological health and habitat suitability.
  - Supports data integration with other environmental datasets to enhance the value of the monitoring program and facilitate broader data access.
