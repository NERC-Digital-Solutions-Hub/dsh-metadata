# Chemical composition of anaerobic digestate and biomass ash blends as a result of storage

## Purpose and scope
- Examines how adding biomass ash affects nutrient stability in anaerobic digestate, focusing on ammonium retention and changes over several months.
- Investigates labile agronomic components (nitrogen and sulphur) in ash-amended versus unamended digestates.
- Part of a broader study on storage effects and potential agronomic value of digestate-ash blends.

## Data sources and samples
- Digestates (AD plants): samples sourced from different UK industrial-scale plants at various project stages; 5–10 kg per sample collected post-digestion and stored cold.
- Biomass ashes: fly ash and bottom ash fractions obtained as waste from biomass combustion; samples typically 10–20 kg; ground to pass 1 mm; stored for analysis.
- Sample preparation: composites created from each sample type, air-dried, milled, sieved, and stored until analysis.

## Materials characterization and measurements
- Analyzed traits (examples):
  - Oven Dry Solids (DS), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (Total-N)
  - Nitrate-N (N-NO3), Ammonium-N (N-NH4)
  - Total Phosphorus (P), Total Potassium (K), Total Magnesium (Mg)
  - Trace elements: Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Mo, Cl, B
  - Total Sulphur (S), Total Calcium (Ca)
- Measurement methods include standard soil/solid analyses (e.g., JAS methods, APHA references) and were performed by external laboratories (NRM) or accredited methods.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Substrates and amendments:
  - Digestates: D1 and D2 (different feedstock compositions)
  - Ash amendments: A1 and A2 (ash variants)
  - Acidified variants: addition of concentrated H2SO4 to acidify to pH 5.5
- Treatments (nine total across two main substrates with/without ash and acidification):
  - D1, D1A1, D2, D2A1, and their acidified counterparts (e.g., AD1, AD1A1, AD2, AD2A1)
- Acidification specifics:
  - Nine-litre samples were acidified where required; volumes of 98% H2SO4 added to reach pH 5.5 (varying by treatment; see Table 4 in the dataset description).
- Replication and storage:
  - Each treatment subdivided into three replicates; stored indoors at ~20°C.
  - Subsamples taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 for analysis.
- Analytical suite (per Table 5) includes DS, pH, Total-N, Total-S, and other elemental metrics.

## Data quality, metadata, and governance considerations
- Comprehensive characterisation provides traceable data provenance and a clear link between treatments and outcomes.
- Metadata schema includes: Treatment, Material, Acid addition flag, Days, Replicate, pH, DS, and: Total-N, TS, TKNf, TSf, TSd, TKNd, and various elemental concentrations.
- Data sharing and openness are addressed, but acidification experiments highlighted practical data-gathering and reproducibility considerations for real-world implementation.

## Practical challenges and implications for monitoring frameworks
- Acidification challenges:
  - Foaming during acidification; required vigorous agitation to reach target pH, posing scalability issues for commercial practice.
  - Practical barriers to applying digestate acidification at scale despite potential agronomic benefits.
- Data and metadata issues:
  - Some treatments rely on precise acid volumes; variability in handling can affect reproducibility.
  - Importance of robust metadata to verify dataset suitability for monitoring and decision-making.
- Data governance implications:
  - Public sharing of datasets is essential for transparency but can be a barrier; the study foregrounds the need for clear data stewardship and governance processes.
- Monitoring relevance:
  - The dataset supports assessment of nitrogen stability and ammonium loss risks in digestate-ash blends, informing policy decisions on waste valorisation, fertiliser use, and storage practices.
  - Provides a rich chemical baseline to evaluate environmental health implications of digestate management under different storage and amendment scenarios.
