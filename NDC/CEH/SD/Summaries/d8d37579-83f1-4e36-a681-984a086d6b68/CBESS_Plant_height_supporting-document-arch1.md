# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) plant height on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset of plant height measurements on salt marsh sites across two contrasting UK regions (Essex and Morecambe Bay) to support analyses of vegetation structure and potential ecosystem service implications.
- Ten direct height measurements per 1m x 1m quadrat, with derived diversity metrics.

## Sampling design and locations
- Monitoring period: Winter and Summer 2013.
- Regions and sites:
  - Essex (clay soils): Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay (sandy soils): Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Coordinates provided for each observation site.
- Habitat context and grazing:
  - Essex sites: hare grazing; heavy grazing by overwintering Brent geese at AH and FW.
  - Morecambe Bay sites: intensive sheep grazing at CS and WS; winter grazing by pink-footed geese; West Plain lightly grazed.
- Each site includes multiple 1m x 1m quadrats with ten height measurements per quadrat.

## Variables and measurements
- Primary measurements: Plant height (cm) recorded as H1–H10 per quadrat.
- Derived metrics per quadrat:
  - Mean Height (cm) from H1–H10.
  - SD (standard deviation) of H1–H10.
  - SE (standard error) of H1–H10.
  - CoV (coefficient of variation) = (SD/Mean) × 100, used as a vegetation height diversity score.
- Categorical/descriptive fields for each observation:
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S).
  - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E).
  - Site: CS, WS, WP (Morecambe) or AH, FW, TM (Essex).
  - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM).
  - Quadrat Number: 1–22.
  - Scale: A = 1 m, B = 1–10 m, C = 10–100 m, D = 100– upper limit (categorical codes).

## Data structure and formats
- File format: Excel workbook.
- Row Number: Sortable index to preserve input order.
- Height data: H1–H10 (cm) per quadrat.
- Derived fields: Mean Height (cm), SD, SE, CoV (two sets noted in field descriptions for potential alternate calculations).
- Dataset field descriptions cover Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Quadrat Number, Scale, and H1–H10 alongside derived statistics.

## Notes and interpretation
- Calibration procedures: None.
- Data quality checks: Not explicitly described.
- Potential limitations to consider: regional differences in soil type and grazing regimes; variability in inundation, vegetation type, and creeks; limited time frame (two seasons in one year) and finite number of quadrats per site.
- Potential uses: cross-site comparisons of vegetation height structure, exploration of relationships between height metrics and habitat/soil type, grazing impact analyses, and calculation of vegetation height diversity as an ecological indicator.
