# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) plant height on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Long-form dataset describing plant height measurements to support monitoring of coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service sustainability.
- Provides standardized plant height metrics and variability across salt marsh sites in two UK regions (Essex and Morecambe Bay).

## Study Sites and Timing
- Locations: Essex — Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM); Morecambe Bay — Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS). Coordinates: AH 51°47'N, 0°52'E; FW 51°49'N, 0°58'E; TM 51°41'N, 0°56'E; CS 54°10'N, 3°0'W; WS 54°08'N, 2°48'W.
- Habitat context: Saltmarsh sites representing contrasting soil types (Essex clay soils; Morecambe Bay sandy soils) with differences in inundation, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
- Grazing regime: Essex sites hare-grazed (heavy grazing by Brent geese); Morecambe Bay sites heavily grazed by sheep (CS/WS) with geese grazing in winter; one site in Morecambe Bay lightly grazed (West Plain).
- Sampling period: Winter and Summer 2013.

## Data Collection and Variables
- Sampling design: Ten direct measurements of plant height per 1m x 1m quadrat, taken randomly within each quadrat using hand and meter rule.
- Primary variable: Plant height (cm). Derived metrics include SD, SE, and CoV (coefficient of variation).
- Data processing: CoV used as a vegetation height diversity score (higher CoV = greater height diversity).
- Data format: Excel workbook.

## Methods and Data Processing
- Observational procedure: Ten height measurements per quadrat, random within quadrat.
- Statistical treatment: CoV calculated as (SD / Mean) × 100 to create a vegetation height diversity metric.
- Calibration: No separate calibration procedures reported.

## Data Format and Quality
- File format: Excel workbook.
- Quality control: Not specified in the dataset description.
- Data storage and availability: Aligns with standard practice of storing datasets and uploading to appropriate data portals.

## Dataset Field Descriptions (Structure)
- Row Number: Sort order (Number).
- Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S).
- Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E).
- Site: Morecambe — Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP); Essex — Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).

- Quadrat Number: 1–22.
- Scale: A = 1m; B = 1–10m; C = 10–100m; D = 100–upper limit.
- H1–H10: Plant height measurements (cm) 1–10.
- Mean Height (cm): Mean of H1–H10.
- SD: Standard deviation of H1–H10.
- SE: Standard error of H1–H10.
- CoV: Coefficient of variation for H1–H10.

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring Analysts
- Provides a standardized, comparable set of vegetation height metrics across multiple salt marsh sites and grazing regimes.
- Enables assessment of vegetation structure and potential implications for ecosystem services.
- Supports time-series comparisons and linking vegetation height diversity to environmental health or policy performance.

## Opportunities and Challenges
- Value expansion: Combine these height data with soil type, inundation frequency, and grazing data to enhance monitoring of habitat condition and ecosystem services.
- Data accessibility: Consider making underlying raw measurements available to improve transparency and reusability for broader analyses.
