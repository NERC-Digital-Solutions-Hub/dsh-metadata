# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) plant height on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset records ten direct measurements of plant height per 1m x 1m quadrat.
- Focus areas: salt marsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay.
- Timeframe: field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013.
- Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
- Includes derived statistics: CoV (coefficient of variation) as a vegetation height diversity score, plus mean height, SD, and SE per quadrat.

## Location and site context
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS); West Plain (WP) referenced in site descriptions.
- Site characteristics:
  - Soil types: clay soils in Essex vs. sandy soils in Morecambe Bay.
  - Inundation, creek structure, and dominant vegetation differ between regions.
  - Grazing regimes differ: Essex heavily grazed by hares and Brent geese; Morecambe Bay heavily grazed by sheep with winter grazing by pink-footed geese; West Plain noted as lightly grazed.

## Sampling design and data collection
- Quadrats: 1m x 1m with ten direct height measurements taken randomly within each quadrat.
- Quadrat identifiers: up to 22 quadrats per dataset (Quadrat Number 1 to 22).
- Measurement method: hand measurement and meter ruler.
- Seasonal sampling: Winter (W) and Summer (S) within 2013 field campaign.

## Variables and data structure
- Primary measurements: plant height (cm) for up to ten readings per quadrat (H1–H10).
- Derived metrics per quadrat:
  - Mean Height (cm): mean of H1–H10.
  - SD: standard deviation of H1–H10.
  - SE: standard error of H1–H10.
  - CoV: coefficient of variation of H1–H10, used as vegetation height diversity score.
- Data dictionary fields:
  - Row Number, Season (Winter or Summer), Location (Morecambe or Essex), Site (CS, WS, WP; AH, FW, TM), Habitat (Mudflat MF or Saltmarsh SM), Quadrat Number (1–22).
  - Scale categories (A–D) indicating spatial extent.
  - H1–H10 heights, Mean Height, SD, SE, CoV.
- Data file format: Excel workbook.

## Data quality and provenance
- Calibration procedures: none documented.
- Data checking / quality control procedures: not specified.
- Metadata detail: dataset includes a structured field description and a data dictionary to aid interpretation and reuse.

## Access, sharing, and governance considerations
- The dataset appears suitable for upload to data portals and catalogues as part of CBESS data holdings.
- Important governance considerations for data stewards:
  - Documentation of licensing and access conditions (not specified in text).
  - Clear versioning and update procedures for future recordings.
  - Preservation of measurement method, site contexts, and grazing/water regime notes to support reuse and comparability.
  - Explicit data quality notes and any limitations (e.g., seasonal window, potential missing data) to accompany public release.

## Use cases and potential applications
- Assessment of spatial and temporal variation in salt marsh vegetation height across contrasting soil types and grazing regimes.
- Comparative analysis of height diversity (CoV) across Essex vs. Morecambe Bay sites.
- Integration with habitat and ecosystem service evaluations in CBESS datasets.
- Baseline for long-term monitoring of vegetation structure in salt marsh ecosystems.

## Limitations and cautions for users
- Temporal scope limited to Winter and Summer 2013; may affect long-term comparability.
- Calibration and quality control procedures are not documented.
- Some site descriptions (e.g., WP) appear in metadata but are not clearly tied to observation locations; users should verify site mappings.
