# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) plant height on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Aim and scope
- Provides plant height measurements as a metric for salt marsh vegetation structure within the CBESS framework.
- Collected to support environmental health monitoring, assessment of ecosystem service sustainability, and informing policy decisions.

## Sampling design and study context
- Field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013.
- Two contrasting salt marsh regions:
  - Essex: clay soils, more inundation and different creek structure; hare-grazed with heavy grazing by Brent geese at Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick.
  - Morecambe Bay: sandy soils, intensive sheep grazing with pink-footed geese present in winter; includes Cartmel Sands and Warton Sands.
- Sites and coordinates:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes.
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands.
- Sampling unit: 1m x 1m quadrats with ten direct plant height measurements per quadrat.

## Variables and data structure
- Primary measurements:
  - Plant height measurements (H1–H10) in centimeters.
  - Derived metrics: Mean Height (cm), Standard Deviation (SD), Standard Error (SE), Coefficient of Variation (CoV).
  - CoV used as a vegetation height diversity proxy.
- Metadata and descriptors:
  - Row Number; Season (Winter or Summer).
  - Location (Morecambe or Essex); Site (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex).
  - Habitat (Mudflat or Saltmarsh); Quadrat Number (1–22); Scale (A–D representing spatial extents).
- Data format and quality:
  - Observations stored in an Excel workbook.
  - Calibration: none specified.
  - Data quality checks and governance procedures not explicitly detailed beyond standard QA/QC practices implied by the dataset structure.

## Data context and usage notes for monitoring
- Captures spatial and ecological contrasts (soil type, inundation, grazing pressure, vegetation structure) relevant to monitoring habitat health and ecosystem services.
- Enables temporal comparisons via Winter vs. Summer seasons and site-specific grazing regimes.
- Provides both raw measurements (H1–H10) and summary statistics (Mean Height, SD, SE, CoV) to support dashboards, reports, and policy-oriented assessments.
- Rich metadata (locations, habitats, sites, scales) supports data integration with other monitoring datasets and reproducibility of analyses.
