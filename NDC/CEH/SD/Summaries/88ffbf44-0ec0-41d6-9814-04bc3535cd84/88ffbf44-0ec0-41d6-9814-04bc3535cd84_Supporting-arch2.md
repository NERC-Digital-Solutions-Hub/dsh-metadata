# Site Description

- Auchencorth Moss is a 3.4 km2, low-lying ombrotrophic peatland in SE Scotland (55.78°N, -3.23°W; elevation 249–300 m; ~85% peat). Land use is mainly low-intensity sheep grazing with a small peat extraction area in the southwest. Catchment vegetation is patchy grass and sedges over a Sphagnum base, with shrubs in the southern area. The catchment lacks permanent standing water, though hollows can submerge after heavy rainfall. Peats are underlain by glacial till and various sedimentary rock layers. Mean annual water table depth is 12.5 cm above the peat surface, with a range from >55 to 4.5 cm. Soil has dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic nitrogen pools (DOC ~312 ± 15.9 μg C g-1 dry soil; NO3- 4.45 ± 0.48 μg N g-1; NH4+ 21.8 ± 1.85 μg N g-1). Total N deposition is ~0.8 g N m-2 yr-1.

- The catchment drains NE through natural tributaries and old drainage ditches into the Black Burn; total stream length from source to outlet is ~5.2 km with a mean channel width of ~0.65 m. The stream shows a rapid, flashy response to rainfall/snowmelt.

- Drainage ditches in an area of special scientific interest were blocked in March 2015 by Scottish National Heritage using peat dams and plastic piling dams (dates listed per drain show blocking on 9–19 March 2015, with multiple drains processed).

- Experimental monitoring program (three stream-water sites): Lower, Tributary, and Upper, with precise coordinates provided. Continuous and periodic measurements span 2015 into early 2016:
  - CO2 continuous measurements at the lower site (15-minute intervals).
  - Daily DOC concentrations at the lower site.
  - Manual weekly to biweekly DOC and DIC measurements at all three sites.
  - Headspace-based measurements of dissolved GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O) with replicates.

- Data collection and timeframes:
  - CO2_continuous.csv: 11/02/2015 to 03/02/2016.
  - DOC_Daily_Autosampler.csv: 20/02/2015 to 05/11/2015.
  - DOC_DIC_2weeks_Manual.csv: 04/03/2015 to 17/03/2016.
  - GHGs_2weeks_Manual.csv: 04/03/2015 to 07/07/2015.

- Location details (sampling sites):
  - Lower: 55°47'13.36"N, -3°15'32.41"W
  - Tributary: 55°47'07.98"N, -3°15'43.62"W
  - Upper: 55°47'04.14"N, -3°15'43.40"W

- Collection and analytical methods:
  - Continuous CO2: Vaisala GMT220 NDIR sensors, 15-min cadence, sensors under water, temperature and pressure corrections; outputs in mg C L-1.
  - Daily DOC: 200 mL water samples collected daily at the lower site, filtered to 0.45 μm, analyzed by PPM LABTOC to 0.1–4000 mg L-1.
  - DIC and DOC (manual): weekly to biweekly sampling across all sites, filtered and analyzed by LABTOC.
  - GHGs (headspace): 40 mL water samples equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air; two headspace replicates plus ambient air; GC analysis with ECD for N2O and FI for CH4/CO2; detection limits: CO2 10 ppmv, CH4 70 ppbv, N2O 30 ppbv; concentrations converted via Henry’s law.
  - Calibrations: CO/CH4 and N2O via four-point GC calibration; LABTOC analysis calibrated with three-point 0–50 ppm standards.
  - Recorded variables and units: Date (dd/mm/yyyy local time), Site ID; DOC (mg C L-1), DIC (mg C L-1), CO2 (mg C L-1), CH4 (μg C L-1), N2O (μg N L-1).

- Data management and outputs:
  - Data are organized into standardized files (CO2_continuous.csv, DOC_Daily_Autosampler.csv, DOC_DIC_2weeks_Manual.csv, GHGs_2weeks_Manual.csv) with clear site identifiers and measurement dates for transparency and comparability.
  - Datasets are aligned with a standard environmental monitoring approach suitable for QA/QC, facilitating long-term monitoring and policy evaluation.

- Context and references:
  - The work builds on prior research into peatland carbon fluxes and aquatic greenhouse gas budgets (Dinsmore et al., 2010; 2013; Drewer et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2010; Billett et al., 2004; Dawson et al., 1995).

- Particular challenges for analysts:
  - Increasing the value of monitoring datasets by integrating them with additional relevant data beyond single-use outputs.
  - Enabling broad access to the underlying data that support final outputs and interpretations.
