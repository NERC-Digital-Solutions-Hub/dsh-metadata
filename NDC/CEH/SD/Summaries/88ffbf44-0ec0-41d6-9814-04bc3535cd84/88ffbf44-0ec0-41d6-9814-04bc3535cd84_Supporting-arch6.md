# Auchencorth Moss

## Overview
- 3.4 km2 ombotrophic peatland in SE Scotland with low-intensity land use (predominantly sheep grazing; minor peat extraction).
- Catchment drains to Black Burn; characterized by a rapid, flashy hydrograph.
- Peat depths range from <0.5 m to >5 m; mean annual water table depth about 12.5 cm, with fluctuations above peat surface.
- Baseline soil chemistry and deposition: DOC and inorganic N present in peat; total N deposition ~0.8 g N m-2 yr-1.
- Ditch drainage in upper catchment blocked by SNH in March 2015 (peat dams and plastic piling dams) to study hydrological and carbon flux responses.
- Study design centers on three stream water sites to monitor carbon dynamics (CO2, DOC, DIC) and greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O) before and after drainage modification.

## Intervention and Study Design
- Drain blocking with peat dams and plastic piling dams conducted March 2015; locations shown in accompanying maps; blocking dates listed in a corresponding table.
- Experimental setup includes three sampling sites along the stream network: Lower, Tributary, and Upper.
- Measurements span 2015 into early 2016, with specific datasets covering continuous CO2, DOC, DIC, and GHGs (CH4, N2O, CO2).

## Site Locations
- Lower: Latitude 55°47'13.36"N, Longitude 3°15'32.41'W
- Tributary: Latitude 55°47'07.98"N, Longitude 3°15'43.62'W
- Upper: Latitude 55°47'04.14"N, Longitude 3°15'43.40'W

## Data Collection Periods
- CO2 continuous: 11/02/2015 – 03/02/2016
- DOC daily autosampler: 20/02/2015 – 05/11/2015
- DIC manual (2-week sampling): 04/03/2015 – 17/03/2016
- GHGs manual (2-week sampling): 04/03/2015 – 07/07/2015

## Measurements and Analytical Methods

- Continuous CO2 concentrations (Lower site)
  - Instrument: Vaisala GMT220 NDIR sensors
  - Sampling: every 15 minutes
  - Deployment: under water surface with PTFE membrane protection
  - Corrections: temperature and pressure (water depth)
  - Units: mg C L-1

- Daily DOC concentrations
  - Sample collection: 200 mL from lower site via Isco 3700 sampler; daily collection, weekly delivery
  - Filtration: 0.45 μm
  - Analysis: PPM LABTOC Analyser (0.1–4000 mg L-1)
  - Units: mg C L-1

- Manual DOC and DIC (three sites)
  - Sampling: ~weekly soon after start, then ~biweekly
  - Method: syringe filtration (0.45 μm); 30 mL Nalgene bottles
  - Analysis: PPM LABTOC Analyser
  - Units: DOC and DIC in mg C L-1

- Dissolved GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O) via headspace
  - Procedure: 40 mL water equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air; two replicates per site plus ambient air sample
  - Analysis: HP5890 GC with ECD (N2O) and flame ionisation detector (CH4/CO2)
  - Detection limits: CO2 10 ppmv, CH4 70 ppbv, N2O 30 ppbv
  - Calculation: dissolved concentrations derived from headspace concentrations using Henry’s law

## Calibration and Quality

- Gas chromatography: four-point CH4 and N2O calibration standards
  - CH4 standards: 1.26, 1.83, 5.16, 101.1 ppmv
  - N2O standards: 0.1995, 0.285, 0.490, 0.975 ppmv
- LABTOC analyser: three-point calibration for 0–50 ppm range
- Data recorded with the following fields: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Site, DOC (mg C L-1), DIC (mg C L-1), CO2 (mg C L-1), CH4 (μg C L-1), N2O (μg N L-1)

## Data Availability and Notes

- Data collected with some occasional gaps due to low water levels or sampler issues (noted for DOC autosampler data).
- Measurements focus on quantifying stream CO2, dissolved inorganic and organic carbon, and greenhouse gases before and after drain-ditching interventions.
