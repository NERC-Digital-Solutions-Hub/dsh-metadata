# Site Description

- Auchencorth Moss is a 3.4 km² low-lying ombrotrophic peatland in SE Scotland (approx. 55.783°N, -3.233°W) with 85% peat.
- Land use: predominantly low-intensity sheep grazing; small peat extraction area in the southwest.
- Catchment vegetation: patchy grasses and sedges on a Sphagnum-dominated base; microtopography features hummocks and hollows.
- Hydrology: hollows can submerge after heavy rainfall; no permanent standing water; peat depths range from <0.5 m to >5 m; underlain by glacial till and Carboniferous/Devonian bedrock.
- Groundwater and nutrient context: mean water table depth ~12.5 cm (range >55 to 4.5 cm); mean DOC in porewater 312 ± 15.9 μg C g⁻¹ dry soil; inorganic N (NO₃⁻ and NH₄⁺) 4.45 ± 0.48 and 21.8 ± 1.85 μg N g⁻¹; total N deposition ~0.8 g N m⁻² yr⁻¹.
- Drainage and restoration: drainage ditches at the top of the catchment blocked in 2015 using peat dams and plastic piling dams by SNH to restore hydrology.

## Experimental context and site layout

- Three stream water sampling sites: Lower, Tributary, and Upper, with precise coordinates provided.
  - Lower: 55°47'13.36"N, 3°15'32.41"W
  - Tributary: 55°47'07.98"N, 3°15'43.62"W
  - Upper: 55°47'04.14"N, 3°15'43.40"W
- Timeframe: measurements conducted in 2015 and into early 2016.
- Blocking dates for drains (peat and plastic dams) clustered around March 2015, with multiple drains treated (dates listed per drain in the source table).

## Experimental design and sampling regime

- Datasets and date ranges:
  - CO2 continuous: 11/02/2015 to 03/02/2016
  - DOC daily autosampler: 20/02/2015 to 05/11/2015
  - DIC (2-week manual sampling): 04/03/2015 to 17/03/2016
  - GHGs (2-week manual sampling): 04/03/2015 to 07/07/2015
- Measurements conducted at three stream-water sites, aligned with the study’s aims to characterize carbon and greenhouse gas dynamics across the catchment.

## Collection and analytical methods

- Continuous CO2 concentrations (lower site):
  - Instrument: Vaisala GMT220 NDIR sensors
  - Frequency: every 15 minutes
  - Deployment: under water, with PTFE membranes, connected to a datalogger
  - Calibration: corrected for temperature and pressure (gas depth/atmospheric conditions); reported as mg C L⁻¹
- Daily dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations:
  - Sampling: 200 mL water samples collected daily at the lower site; weekly sampling achieved
  - Filtration: 0.45 μm filters
  - Analysis: PPM LABTOC Analyser (0.1–4000 mg L⁻¹)
- Manual sampling for DOC and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC):
  - Frequency: ~weekly March–July 2015, then ~biweekly thereafter
  - Procedure: 60 mL syringe grab samples, filtered (0.45 μm) into 30 mL bottles; analysis with LABTOC Analyser
- Dissolved greenhouse gases (GHG): CO2, CH4, N2O
  - Method: headspace technique (drawn from 40 mL water samples equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air)
  - Analysis: GC HP5890 with ECD (N2O) and FID (CH4/CO2); two replicate headspace samples per occasion
  - Detection limits: CO2 10 ppmv, CH4 70 ppbv, N2O 30 ppbv
  - Calculations: dissolved concentrations derived from headspace and ambient air via Henry’s law
- Calibration and standards:
  - Gas chromatography: four-point CH4 and N2O calibration (CH4: 1.26 – 101.1 ppmv; N2O: 0.1995 – 0.975 ppmv)
  - LABTOC: three-point calibration for concentrations 0–50 ppm
- Data records and units:
  - Date: dd/mm/yyyy local time
  - Site: Lower, Tributary, Upper (per Table 3)
  - DOC: mg C L⁻¹
  - DIC: mg C L⁻¹
  - CO2: mg C L⁻¹
  - CH4: μg C L⁻¹
  - N2O: μg N L⁻¹

## Data governance, quality, and sustainability considerations

- Data provenance: three sampling sites with clearly defined collection methods and calibration procedures; multiple complementary datasets (continuous CO2, DOC, DIC, and GHGs).
- Metadata completeness: site coordinates, sampling frequencies, measurement methods, calibration details, units, and references are documented.
- Data quality and limitations:
  - Occasional missing DOC samples due to low water or sampling issues
  - Weekly-to-biweekly sampling cadence; continuity dependent on hydrological conditions
- Data management implications for data stewards:
  - Ensure consistent unit standards across datasets (e.g., mg C L⁻¹ for carbon species; μg N L⁻¹ for N2O)
  - Maintain provenance and method versions (instrument models, calibration ranges, detection limits)
  - Track drain-blocking events and hydrological changes as contextual metadata influencing flux calculations
  - Facilitate data sharing via appropriate portals with complete metadata and calibration notes
