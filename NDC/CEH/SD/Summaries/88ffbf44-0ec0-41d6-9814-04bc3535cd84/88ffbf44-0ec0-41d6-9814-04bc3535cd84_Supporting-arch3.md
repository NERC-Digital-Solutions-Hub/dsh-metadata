# Auchencorth Moss Site Description

## Overview and context
- A 3.4 km² ombrotrophic peatland in SE Scotland (Auchencorth Moss) with low-intensity sheep grazing and limited peat extraction.
- Catchment drainage via natural streams and old ditches; stream channel length ~5.2 km with an average width of 0.65 m.
- Catchment exhibits a rapid, flashy response to storm or snowmelt events.
- In March 2015, drainage ditches at an area of special scientific interest were blocked using peat dams and plastic piling dams to alter hydrology and investigate carbon dynamics.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Three stream water sampling sites: Lower, Tributary, and Upper (with precise latitude/longitude provided).
- Measurements conducted in 2015 and early 2016; date ranges for each dataset detailed in the study.
- Datasets include:
  - Continuous CO2 concentrations at the lower site (15-minute intervals).
  - Daily DOC concentrations from the lower site (200 mL water samples via autosampler; weekly lab analysis).
  - Manual DOC and DIC measurements at all three sites (approximately weekly to biweekly).
  - Dissolved GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O) via headspace method (two replicate headspace samples per occasion).
- Drain blocking dates for each ditch documented (varying between peat dam and plastic dam, predominantly around 09–19 March 2015 with multiple entries).

## Collection and analytical methods
- Continuous CO2:
  - Vaisala GMT220 NDIR sensors deployed under the water surface, 15-minute data intervals.
  - Temperature and pressure corrections applied; results expressed as mg C L⁻¹.
- DOC sampling:
  - Daily autosampler collection of 200 mL water from the lower site; samples filtered and analyzed for DOC (range 0.1–4000 mg L⁻¹).
  - Manual sampling from all three sites: 60 mL syringes, 0.45 µm filtration, analyzed for DOC/DIC.
- GHGs sampling:
  - Headspace technique with equilibration of 40 mL water with 20 mL ambient air; two headspace replicates plus ambient air sample.
  - Gas chromatography with ECD and FID for N2O and CH4/CO2; detection limits specified.
  - Dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O calculated from headspace concentrations using Henry’s law.
- Instrument calibration:
  - CO2/CH4/N2O measurements calibrated with four standards for GC (CH4 and N2O).
  - LABTOC analyser calibrated with a three-point 0–50 ppm standard range.

## Data structure, units, and quality control
- Recorded values include:
  - Date (dd/mm/yyyy, local time)
  - Site (Lower, Tributary, Upper)
  - DOC (mg C L⁻¹)
  - DIC (mg C L⁻¹)
  - CO2 (mg C L⁻¹)
  - CH4 (µg C L⁻¹)
  - N2O (µg N L⁻¹)
- Explicit metadata on sampling periods, site locations, and measurement techniques supports traceability and comparability.
- Data gaps and issues noted:
  - Occasional missing DOC samples due to low water levels or sampler programming problems.
  - Multiple scheduled sampling events with varying frequency (weekly to biweekly) to maintain longitudinal coverage.

## Intervention and policy-relevant context
- The 2015 ditch blocking represents a natural experiment to evaluate how hydrological restoration impacts carbon transport and greenhouse gas dynamics in a peatland catchment.
- The study integrates continuous and discrete sampling to capture both short-term responses and longer-term trends in carbon and greenhouse gases.
