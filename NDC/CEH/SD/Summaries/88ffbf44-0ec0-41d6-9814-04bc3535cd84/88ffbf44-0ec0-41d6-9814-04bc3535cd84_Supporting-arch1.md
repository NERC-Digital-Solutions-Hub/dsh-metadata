# Site Description

- Auchencorth Moss is a 3.4 km2 peatland in SE Scotland (55°47' N, 3°14'W), with 85% peat and low-intensity sheep grazing. The catchment features a Sphagnum-dominated base with a hummock/hollow microtopography, occasional shrubs, and no permanent pools. Peat depths range from <0.5 m to >5 m; underlying geology includes glacial till and carboniferous/Devonian sandstones and shales.
- Hydrology and nutrient context: annual mean water table depth is 12.5 cm (range >55 to 4.5 cm above peat). Water extracts show mean DOC 312 ± 15.9 μg C g-1 dry soil, nitrate 4.45 ± 0.48 μg N g-1, and ammonium 21.8 ± 1.85 μg N g-1. Total N deposition is 0.8 g N m-2 yr-1. The catchment drains via natural tributaries and old drainage ditches into the Black Burn; the stream responds rapidly to rainfall (flashy hydrograph).
- Drainage manipulation: in March 2015, SNH blocked ditches at the upper catchment using peat dams and plastic piling dams. Locations and blocking dates are provided in accompanying figures and a table of 2015 blocking dates.

- Study sites and location data: three stream-water sites (Lower, Tributary, Upper) with coordinates:
  - Lower: 55°47'13.36"N, 3°15'32.41"W
  - Tributary: 55°47'07.98"N, 3°15'43.62"W
  - Upper: 55°47'04.14"N, 3°15'43.40"W

- Experimental design and timescales:
  - Measurements conducted in 2015 into early 2016 at three sites.
  - Datasets span 2015–2016 with specific start/end dates per dataset (e.g., continuous CO2 11/02/2015–03/02/2016; DOC daily autosampler 20/02/2015–05/11/2015; DOC/DIC manual 04/03/2015–17/03/2016; GHGs manual 04/03/2015–07/07/2015).

- Data collection regimes:
  - Continuous CO2: 15-minute measurements at the lower site using Vaisala GMT220 NDIR sensors; sensors encased and corrected for temperature and pressure; results expressed as mg C L-1.
  - DOC (daily autosampler): 200 mL stream-water samples collected daily at the lower site (filtered and analyzed for DOC up to 4000 mg L-1).
  - DOC/DIC (manual): approximately weekly sampling March–July 2015, then ~every 2 weeks; 60 mL samples filtered and analyzed similarly for DIC/DOC.
  - GHGs (headspace method): 40 mL water samples equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air; two headspace replicates per occasion plus ambient air sample; analysis by GC with ECD for N2O and FI for CH4/CO2; detection limits provided.

- Calibration and analytical details:
  - Gas chromatography: four-point calibration for CH4 and N2O; LABTOC analyzer calibration (0–50 ppm) for CH4 and N2O; standard concentrations listed (CH4: 1.26–101.1 ppm; N2O: 0.1995–0.975 ppm).
  - Data units and formats: Date (dd/mm/yyyy, local time); Site identifier; DOC (mg C L-1); DIC (mg C L-1); CO2 (mg C L-1); CH4 (μg C L-1); N2O (μg N L-1).

- Notable methodological details:
  - CO2 sensors were deployed under the water surface with protective housings and corrected for temperature and depth-related pressure variations.
  - DOC samples were processed immediately or preserved and analyzed with a high-range analyzer (PPM LABTOC) in Edinburgh.
  - Henry’s law used to convert dissolved gas concentrations from headspace measurements to dissolved concentrations.
