# GPS accuracy = 4m

## Overview
- The document records field sampling coordinates and distances across multiple transects to support environmental monitoring.
- It begins with a note: GPS accuracy is 4 meters; some samples labeled H or M may require digging at convenient spots.
- Transects include: LL A1/A2, LL B1/B2, HWA1/HWB, OV 7, WHA/WHB, each with an initial coordinate pair and a sequence of points at increasing distances.

## Data structure and content
- For each site, the data present:
  - Initial location: latitude and longitude (e.g., LL A1: N 54 21.312, W001 30.840).
  - A distance label at the start (often H or M), followed by successive points at distances: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 (and sometimes additional coordinates at larger steps).
  - Subsequent coordinates are listed with updated lat/long values corresponding to each distance step (e.g., LL A1 progresses from 2 m to 64 m; LL A2, HWA1, HWB, OV 7, WHA, WHB follow similar patterns).
- Some sites show multiple coordinate updates that pair with increasing distances, illustrating a transect line or grid sweep.

## Methods and intent
- Standardized spatial data collection across multiple transects to enable consistent environmental health assessment over time.
- Data likely intended for integration into maps, charts, and reports that support monitoring outputs.
- Emphasizes alignment with broader data management practices: verifying, cleaning, and transforming data; storing datasets in appropriate portals.

## Data quality and standardization considerations
- GPS accuracy stated as 4 meters, indicating the precision level of recorded points.
- Use of consistent labeling (H, M, and distance steps) to denote sampling methods or positions along transects.
- The format supports reproducibility and comparison across sites and time.

## Challenges and opportunities for analysts
- Challenge: Increasing the value of these datasets by integrating them with other relevant environmental data (avoiding single-use datasets).
- Challenge: Facilitating access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs, enabling broader analysis and reuse.

## Relevance to the Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype
- Demonstrates how field data are captured in a consistent, standardized format suitable for monitoring environmental conditions and policy performance.
- Provides a clear example of data capture, QA potential, and the need for data publication and inter-dataset integration to enhance environmental monitoring and reporting.
