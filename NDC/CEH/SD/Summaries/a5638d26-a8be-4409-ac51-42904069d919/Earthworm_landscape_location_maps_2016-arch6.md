# Archetype: Data Support

## Aim
- To help others explore data, find and combine data, analyze it, and create data products that others can explore easily.
- Use data analysis and communication skills to support data use across a broad range of topics.
- Often work within organisations with less specialised remits (e.g., local councils or private companies).

## Who they are
- Possess data analysis and communication skills; support a wide range of topics rather than deep specialization.
- Typically operate in less specialised organisations, supporting policy work and sometimes public-facing data communication.

## How they meet their aims
- Understand the ask: determine what is needed, why it’s needed, and the best way to meet those needs.
- Find and verify sufficient data, potentially consulting topic experts.
- Quality assure, clean, and transform data; combine datasets.
- Analyse patterns to identify significant features.
- Create self-serve products (dashboards, pivot tables) or deliver reports/charts with guidance on usage.
- Promote outputs and gather feedback to improve products; may share early prototypes.
- Advocate for better data creation.

## Particular Challenges
- Time spent understanding the ask due to limited data consideration in wider teams.
- Working with patchy data across a wide range of formats.
- Accessing data from different systems.
- Difficulty communicating complex information simply.
- Promoting outputs to ensure they are used; concerns outputs are not widely shared or reused.
