# Summary Experimental Design/Sampling Regime

- Purpose and context
  - Document describes a field protocol to assess earthworm abundance and biomass across different land uses and hedge systems, supporting environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
  - Focuses on hedgerow-adjacent soils and field interiors to compare management regimes (organic vs conventional) and habitat conditions.

- Experimental design
  - Study units: Multiple farms/sites (e.g., Little Langton LL, Hutton Wandesley HW, Overton OV, Whenby WH) with varied land use (organic arable A1/A2, organic ley B1/B2, conventional arable, etc.).
  - Sampling units per site: 1 transect laid at 90 degrees from hedge into the field; transects positioned to enable hedgerow vs. field comparisons; paired transects for some sites (WH/HW) and opposite hedge sides for others (LL).
  - Temporal framing: Sampling conducted in May 2016 (dates specified per site).
  - Field condition notes: Each site records hedge condition, margins, drainage features, and visible soil characteristics to contextualize results.

- Collection methods and instrumentation
  - Soil pit sampling along transect: pits at hedge, margin, and progressively farther distances (2m, 4m, 8m, 16m, 32m, 64m).
  - Earthworm extraction: hand sorting of soil followed by mustard solution (dilute allyl isothiocyanate) to collect earthworms; specimens preserved in ethanol for identification.
  - Identification: species identified using Sims and Gerard Field studies key.
  - Ancillary measurements at each pit: soil moisture (3 readings at 5 and 10 cm using a ThetaProbe), soil temperature (5 and 10 cm), soil bulk density (5 and 15 cm) using bulk density rings.

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Earthworms: counts (abundance) and biomass (grams).
  - Distances: metres from hedge; sample location codes Hedge (H) or Margin (M).
  - Depth notation: P (Mustard sample) or S (Topsoil).

- Data structure and files
  - Earthworm data: 9 files (e.g., HWA1_EW_landscape.csv, HWB_EW_landscape.csv, LLA1_EW_landscape.csv, etc.) with 30 columns.
  - Key columns include: Date, Field, Transect, Distance, Depth, Sample type (A = abundance, B = biomass), and species-specific counts/biomass.
  - Species and codes cover 20+ taxa with three functional groups: Endogeic, Epigeic, and Anecic; includes “damaged” and “immature” designations.
  - Landscape data: Landscape2016_soil_data.csv with 14 columns recording moisture (three 5 cm depth reps and three 10 cm depth reps), soil temperature (5 cm and 10 cm), and soil bulk density (5 cm and 15 cm).

- Additional data details
  - Species list includes scientific names and codes (e.g., Allolobophora chlorotica, Eisenia fetida, Lumbricus terrestris, etc.) categorized by functional group.
  - Data notes emphasize sample IDs, paired sampling where applicable, and precise transect orientation relative to hedge and field features.

- Miscellaneous and references
  - Functional group definitions provided (Endogeic, Epigeic, Anecic) and example species mapping.
  - Reference for identification methodology: Sims & Gerard (1999).

- Potential use in monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a standardized, repeatable protocol for soil biota monitoring linked to land-use and hedge-management variables.
  - Enables cross-site comparability through consistent transect design, extraction methods, and data structure.
  - Supports integration with soil physical/chemical parameters to contextualize biotic responses and inform policy decisions.
