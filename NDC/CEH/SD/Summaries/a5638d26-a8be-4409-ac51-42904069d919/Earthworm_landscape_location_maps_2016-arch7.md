# Little Langton (LL) Hill House farm cottages, DL7 0PZ; Overton farm, field 7 (OV7); Overton, York

## Overview
- Lists two location references with identifiers:
  - Little Langton (LL) Hill House farm cottages, DL7 0PZ
  - Overton farm, field 7 (OV7), Overton, York

## GIS-ready data considerations
- Treat as two geospatial features (potentially points for locations or polygons if boundaries available).
- Attributes to capture: name, identifier/code (LL, OV7), and address/postcode.

## Data quality and standards
- Ambiguity in place details may require validation (Overton, York region/specification).
- Ensure consistent formatting of codes in parentheses and correct postcode.

## Next steps for GIS workflow
- Geocode both locations to obtain precise coordinates.
- Create GIS features (points or parcels) with attributes: name, code, postcode, and place context.
- If field boundaries are known (e.g., Overton field 7), link to or create boundary polygon data.
- Validate against authoritative datasets (parcels, land use) and document metadata (source, date, accuracy).
