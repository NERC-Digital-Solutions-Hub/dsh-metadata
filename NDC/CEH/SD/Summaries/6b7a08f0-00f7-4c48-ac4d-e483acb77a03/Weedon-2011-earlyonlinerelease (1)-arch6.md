# Creation of the WATCHForcing Data and its use to assess global and regional reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century

- The text provides basin-scale statistics for key evaporative and meteorological variables used in the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) framework, focusing on 1901-1957 and 1958-2001, with some 1979-2001 refinements. It includes PET-related metrics (PET rc and PET PT), Net Radiation, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, and Precipitation, across several major basins.
- Variables and units covered
  - PET rc (mm/yr) and PET PT (mm/yr)
  - Net Radiation (W/m^2)
  - VPD (kPa)
  - Wind (m/s)
  - Rainfall (mm/yr)
  - Snowfall (mm/yr)
  - Precipitation (mm/yr)
- Time periods presented per basin
  - 1901-1957: baseline period
  - 1958-2001: main historical period
  - 1979-2001: extended recent period (where available)
- Key data presentation details
  - For each basin and variable, the document provides: average (mm/yr or appropriate units), slope per year, slope-min, slope-max, Neff (effective sample size), and Adjusted Slope P (significance indicator)
  - Several entries show missing or incomplete values in this excerpt, and some periods have stronger or weaker statistical significance as indicated by Adjusted Slope P
- Notable basins and example patterns (selected highlights)

    - PET PT: 1901-1957 average ~798.7 mm/yr; slope ~+0.10; 1958-2001 average ~768.0 mm/yr; slope ~-1.26; 1979-2001 average ~752.0 mm/yr; slope ~-0.89
    - Precipitation: 1958-2001 average ~1426.3 mm/yr; slope ~+0.23; 1979-2001 average ~1426.7 mm/yr; slope ~-1.33
- Practical implications for data support and use
  - The data enable basin-specific assessment of evaporation-related drivers (PET_rc vs PET_PT) in relation to radiation, VPD, and precipitation, supporting hydrological modeling and climate impact analyses.
  - The time-segmented structure (1901-1957 vs 1958-2001, with 1979-2001 in some cases) helps identify shifts in trends and potential regime changes across the 20th century.
  - The inclusion of Neff and Adjusted Slope P values helps gauge the reliability and significance of detected trends, guiding which basins/periods are robust for interpretation.
  - Users should account for incomplete entries in some basins/variables and consider regional differences in data quality and sampling when validating model outputs.
- Appendix information
  - Appendix Table 1 describes the order of ERA-40 basis years used in the WATCH Forcing Data for 1901-1957, illustrating how basis years and real years are interleaved to preserve diurnal-to-monthly statistics across the reconstruction.
