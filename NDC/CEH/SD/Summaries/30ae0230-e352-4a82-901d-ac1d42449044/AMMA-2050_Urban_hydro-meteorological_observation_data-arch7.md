# Urban hydro-meteorological observation data 2016-2018  - Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso

## Overview
- Time-series dataset of hydro-meteorological monitoring in Ouagadougou (2016–2018) as part of the DFID AMMA-2050 project.
- Data aim to understand local hydrological function and support hydrological model development.
- In-situ measurements include rainfall, water level, and river flow; data gaps occur due to equipment malfunctions and seasonal dry periods.
- Data collection and processing roles: UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) designed the network and processed data; 2iE collaborated on site administration and metadata.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- In-situ monitoring equipment and sampling cadence vary by site:
  - Dam3: Pressure Level Sensor (PLS) with hourly depth measurements; continuous operation with monthly equipment checks.
  - 2ie: Tipping bucket rain gauge; 15-minute rainfall updates.
  - Saaba, Rimkieta South, Rimkieta North: PLS level (flow) measurements with 5-minute sampling; rating curves derived from spot gauging during storms.
  - Kamboince: Tipping bucket rain gauge; 15-minute rainfall updates.
- Sampling periods span from mid-2016 to late-2018 (dates vary by site; see site metadata for full ranges).
- Location-specific details include coordinates and site elevations.

## Sites and equipment (summary)
- Dam3: PLS at dam outlet; measures water level relative to bed level; central Ouagadougou dam system.
- 2ie: Rainfall via tipping bucket gauge at city centre location near central dam system.
- Saaba: PLS at culvert downstream of a tributary; 12.7 m wide, ~2 m height structure.
- Rimkieta South: PLS at culvert downstream of central pillar; 12.7 m wide, ~2.15 m height.
- Rimkieta North: PLS at culvert; 27.3 m wide, ~2.5 m height.
- Kamboince: Rainfall via tipping bucket at northern city location.

## Transformation and quality control
- Flow site ratings were derived from intermittent spot gauging (velocity and depth) to develop depth–flow relationships (rating curves) for each location.
- Flow time series generated by applying rating curves to measured depths.
- Quality steps:
  - Visual inspection to remove erroneous measurements and QC-labeled data.
  - Rainfall and dam level data also visually inspected for anomalies.
- Data integration uses an Oracle database for flow time series; QA focuses on representativeness during storm events and consistency with depth measurements.

## Data structure and recorded values
- Data products:
  - 6 CSV time-series files (three for flow, one for dam level, two for rainfall).
  - 1 metadata CSV summarizing site details.
- File contents:
  - Flow files: date_time, flow (m3/s), missing data index; minimum flow value is 0 m3/s; M indicates missing data.
  - Dam level file: date_time, level (mAOD), missing data index; minimum depth is 0 m.
  - Rainfall files: date_time, rainfall (mm), missing data index; minimum rainfall is 0.2 mm per 15-minute interval; periods with no rainfall are 0 values.
- Site metadata includes coordinates (lat/lon), elevation (mASL), start and end dates, and time steps.

## Data quality, limitations, and usage notes for GIS
- Data gaps due to equipment malfunction and dry-season pauses (PLS withdrawal) reduce complete temporal coverage.
- Rating curves rely on spot gauging during storms; accuracy depends on cross-sectional area estimates and velocity measurements.
- Time resolution differs by site (15 min to hourly to 5 min), requiring harmonization for cross-site GIS analyses.
- Suitable for:
  - Building hydrological models and calibrating/validating simulations.
  - Creating maps of rainfall, water levels, and estimated flows across Ouagadougou.
  - Visualizing temporal dynamics (hydrographs) and investigating correlations between rainfall and river flow.
- Important considerations:
  - Account for missing data (M markers) and potential gaps in the time series.
  - Use site metadata to correctly geolocate and attribute data in GIS workflows.
  - Validate derived flows against rating curves when comparing across sites or integrating with other datasets.
