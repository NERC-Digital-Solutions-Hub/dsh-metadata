# AFEX Experiment

- A full factorial nutrient addition experiment conducted at the AFEX project area of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), about 80 km north of Manaus, Brazil. Mean annual temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity ranges from 75% to 92% during the rainy season.

## Experimental setup

- Eight treatments plus untreated control, including:
  - N, P, cations (Ca, Mg, K) and combinations (N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations)
- 4 independent blocks, each with 8 plots (total 32 plots)
- Plot size: 50 m x 50 m; central measurement area within each plot is 30 m x 30 m
- Nutrients applied as dry granules 3 times per year with the following rates:
  - N: 125 kg ha-1 year-1 (as urea)
  - P: 50 kg ha-1 year-1 (as triple superphosphate)
  - Ca: 50 kg ha-1 year-1
  - Mg: 20 kg ha-1 year-1 (as dolomitic limestone)
  - K: 50 kg ha-1 year-1
- Plots are arranged with at least 250 m between blocks

## Root sampling

- In each plot (32 plots), five ingrowth cores (12 cm diameter, 30 cm deep) installed in August 2017 within the central 30 m x 30 m area
- Five cores per plot collected every 3 months; cores were homogenised by plot and by soil depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; total N=64)
- Fine roots (<2 mm diameter) manually extracted; roots dried at 60°C to determine dry root mass
- After one year (Nov 2017–Aug 2018), dry fine roots from each plot/depth bulked, ground, and analyzed for nutrient concentrations

## Root subsampling and traits

- Fine roots from both depths (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm) were subsampled
- Subsamples used to determine root morphological traits; roots dried at 60°C to determine dry root mass

## Chemical analysis of macro- and micronutrients

- Root samples < 2 mm diameter bulked by plot and depth for four time intervals (Nov 2017–Aug 2018)
- Samples ground for analysis
- Micronutrients, phosphorus, and cations analyzed by nitroperchloric digestion (Malavolta et al. 1989)
- Bases (K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS)
- Total P measured by colorimetry and spectrophotometry
- Carbon and nitrogen contents determined using an automated CHN analyzer
- Note: roots were not identified by species; nutrient concentrations reflect community averages

## Spreadsheet details (data structure)

- Block: 1–4 (4 blocks)
- Plot: 1–8 within each block
- TRT: 8 nutrient treatments (control, P, N, cations, N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations)
- Depth: 0–10 cm or 10–30 cm
- Elemental concentrations recorded for Fe, Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg, K, P, N, C
- Units specified in the dataset (e.g., mg kg-1, g kg-1, %, etc.)

## Data quality, governance and context

- Data are organized to enable assessment of how different nutrient additions affect root mass and nutrient content across soil depths and time
- Species identity not recorded; results represent community-wide root responses
- Time frame spans multiple sampling intervals within the first year of fertilisation
- Methods for chemical analyses referenced (Malavolta et al.; Anderson & Ingram) to ensure replicability
