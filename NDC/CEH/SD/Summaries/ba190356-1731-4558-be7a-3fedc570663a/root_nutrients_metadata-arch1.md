# AFEX Experiment at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA)

- Study area: AFEX project area, BDFFP/INPA, ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (02°25' S, 59°43' W). Climate: mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% seasonally.

## Experimental design and setup

- Full factorial nutrient addition experiment starting May 2017.
- Treatments: untreated control plus nutrients and combinations — Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), cations (K, Ca, Mg) and their combinations (N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations), total of eight treatments.
- Experimental layout: four independent blocks with at least 250 m distance between blocks; 32 plots in total (4 blocks × 8 plots per block).
- Plot dimensions: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m.
- Nutrient application: dry granules applied three times per year to soil surface (avoiding dry season) at rates of 125 kg ha−1 yr−1 N (urea), 50 kg ha−1 yr−1 P (triple superphosphate), 50 kg ha−1 yr−1 Ca, 20 kg ha−1 yr−1 Mg (dolomitic limestone), and 50 kg ha−1 yr−1 K (potassium chloride).

## Root sampling and processing

- In each plot (n=32), five ingrowth cores per plot: 12 cm diameter, 30 cm deep, placed in central 30 m × 30 m area in August 2017.
- Core design: 2 cm plastic mesh bags; cores collected every three months; five core replicates homogenised by plot and depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; total N=64 per timepoint).
- Root extraction: fine roots (<2 mm diameter) hand-picked for each collection; roots dried at 60°C to determine dry root mass.
- One-year sampling (Nov 2017–Aug 2018): dry fine roots (<2 mm) bulked per plot and depth, ground, and analysed for nutrient concentrations.
- Root subsampling: fine roots (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm) used to determine root morphological traits; dried for dry mass.

## Chemical analysis and nutrient measurements

- Macro- and micronutrients: root samples <2 mm diameter bulked by plot and depth; four time intervals (Nov 2017–Aug 2018) for nutrient analysis.
- Analytical methods:
  - Micronutrients, phosphorus, and cations: nitroperchloric digestion (Malavolta et al., 1989).
  - Cations (K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients: atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS).
  - Phosphorus: colorimetry; quantify by spectrophotometry.
  - Carbon and nitrogen: analyzed with CHN elemental analyzer (Nelson and Sommers, 1996).
- Species-level identification: roots not identified by species; concentrations represent mean values for the plant community.

## Data structure and metadata

- Spreadsheet fields:
  - Block: block where plots were installed (1–4).
  - Plot: description of block and plot (1–8 per block).
  - TRT: nutrient treatment applied (eight categories: control, N, P, cations, N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations).
  - Depth: soil layer sampled (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm).
  - Nutrient concentration columns: Fe, Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg, K, P (units as listed).
  - N and C concentrations: N (%), C (%).
- Units and descriptions are provided for each measured variable (e.g., K, Ca, Mg in g/kg; N and C in %).

## Timeline and data context

- Sampling began with August 2017 installation of ingrowth cores; quarterly core collection continued through 2017–2018.
- Nutrient analyses correspond to the first year of fertilisation (Nov 2017–Aug 2018).
