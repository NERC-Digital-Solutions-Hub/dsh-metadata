# AFEX Experiment

## Aim
- Assess how nitrogen, phosphorus, and cation additions (and their combinations) affect root biomass and root nutrient concentrations in a tropical Amazonian forest fragment system.

## Study location
- AFEX project area, Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.
- Climate: mean air temperature 26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% (lower in August, higher in April).

## Experimental design
- Full factorial nutrient addition with eight treatments: Control; N; P; Cations (Ca, Mg, K); N+P; N+Cations; P+Cations; N+P+Cations.
- 4 replicated blocks; 32 plots total (4 blocks × 8 plots per block).
- Each plot: 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m; plots spaced at least 250 m apart.

## Nutrient application
- Dry granules applied to soil surface three times per year, avoiding the main dry season.
- Application rates: N 125 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as urea); P 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as triple superphosphate); Ca 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹; Mg 20 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as dolomitic limestone); K 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as KCl).

## Root sampling and processing
- For each plot (n=32), five ingrowth cores (12 cm diameter, 30 cm deep) installed in Aug 2017 within the central 30 × 30 m area.
- Cores collected every three months; five cores per plot were homogenised by plot and soil depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; N=64).
- Fine roots (<2 mm) manually extracted, dried at 60°C to determine dry root mass.
- After one year (Nov 2017–Aug 2018), roots were bulked per plot and depth, ground, and analyzed for nutrient concentrations.

## Subsampling and traits
- Fine roots from both depths were subsampled; <2 mm diameter used to determine root morphological traits; dried to measure dry root mass.

## Chemical analysis
- Macro- and micronutrients analyzed on root samples <2 mm (bulk per plot/depth) across four time intervals (Nov 2017–Aug 2018).
- Digestion: nitroperchloric protocol (Malavolta et al., 1989).
- Cations (K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients: atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS).
- Phosphorus: colorimetric method; C and N: CHN analyzer (Nelson & Sommers).
- Species identification not performed; nutrient concentrations reflect community-level averages.

## Data and metadata (Spreadsheet details)
- Columns include: Block, Plot, TRT (treatment), Depth, Fe, Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg, K, P, N, C.
- Each column includes descriptions and units; designed to support standardized data reporting and cross-study comparability.

## Temporal framework
- Sampling windows span November 2017 to August 2018 with quarterly collection intervals for ingrowth cores.

## Key methodological notes for data use
- Root nutrient concentrations represent the mean of the plant community within each plot/depth, not species-specific values.
- Standardized sampling, replication, and depth stratification enable robust comparisons across treatments.
- Data management emphasis: organizational structure (blocks, plots, treatments, depths) facilitates storage, sharing, and potential integration with other environmental datasets.
