# AFEX Experiment

## Site description
- Location: AFEX project area, Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil (02° 25' 00'' S; 59° 43' 00'' W).
- Climate: mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% (rainy season peaks in April).

## Experimental setup - AFEX Experiment
- Design: full factorial nutrient addition with eight treatments plus untreated control.
- Treatments: control, N, P, cations (Ca, Mg, K), N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations.
- Plots and blocks: 32 plots across 4 independent blocks (≥250 m apart).
- Plot size and measurement area: each plot 50 m × 50 m; main measurements in central 30 m × 30 m.
- Nutrient application rates (per year): N 125 kg ha⁻¹ (as urea); P 50 kg ha⁻¹ (as triple superphosphate); Ca 50 kg ha⁻¹; Mg 20 kg ha⁻¹ (dolomitic limestone); K 50 kg ha⁻¹.

## Root sampling
- Per-plot design: five 12 cm-diameter, 30 cm-deep ingrowth cores installed in the central 30 m × 30 m area (August 2017).
- Replication and processing: cores collected every three months; five cores per plot homogenised by plot and depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; total N=64).
- Drying and analysis: roots dried at 60°C to determine dry mass; after one year (Nov 2017–Aug 2018) fine roots <2 mm bulked per plot and depth for nutrient analysis.

## Root subsampling
- Focus: fine roots (<2 mm) from both depths (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm) for morphological trait assessment; dried at 60°C to determine root mass.

## Chemical analysis of macro and micronutrients
- Nutrient analysis method: macro and micronutrients from root samples <2 mm bulked by plot and depth (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm) across four time intervals (Nov 2017–Aug 2018).
- Analytical procedures:
  - Micronutrients, phosphorus, and cations via nitroperchloric digestion (Malavolta et al. 1989).
  - Base cations (K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS).
  - Total phosphorus by colorimetry; carbon and nitrogen by CN analyzer.
- Species identification: roots not identified by species; nutrient concentrations represent mean values for the plant community.

## Spreadsheet details
- Data fields (per entry): Block (1–4), Plot (1–8 per block), TRT (eight treatments described above), Depth (0–10 cm or 10–30 cm).
- Measured variables: Fe, Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg, K, P, N, C (with respective units: mg/kg for some elements, g/kg or % for others; N and C as %).
- Context: data are structured to link plot-level treatments with measured root nutrient concentrations and depths.
