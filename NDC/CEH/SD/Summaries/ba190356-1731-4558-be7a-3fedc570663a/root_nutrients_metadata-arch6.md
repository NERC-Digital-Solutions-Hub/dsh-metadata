# Site description

- Location and climate
  - AFEX project area, Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil (coordinates given).
  - Mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; humidity ranges 75–92% during the rainy season.

- Experimental design: AFEX Experiment
  - Full factorial nutrient addition with eight treatments: control, N, P, cations (Ca, Mg, K), and their combinations N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations.
  - 4 independent blocks (≥250 m apart); 4 replicates per treatment; total of 32 plots.
  - Plots sized 50 m × 50 m; central 30 m × 30 m area used for main measurements.
  - Nutrient application rates (dry granular): N 125 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 (as urea); P 50 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 (as triple superphosphate); Ca 50 kg ha^-1 yr^-1; Mg 20 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 (as dolomitic limestone); K 50 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 (as potassium chloride).

- Root sampling and processing
  - In each plot (n=32), five 12 cm-diameter, 30 cm-deep ingrowth cores installed in August 2017 within the central 30 × 30 m area.
  - Cores collected every three months; five cores per plot and depth pooled and homogenised in the field (by plot and depth: 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; N=64).
  - Fine roots were manually extracted, dried at 60°C to determine dry root mass.
  - After one year (Nov 2017–Aug 2018), dry fine roots <2 mm were bulked per plot and depth, ground, and analysed for nutrient concentrations (representing the plant community as species were not distinguished).

- Root subsampling and trait analysis
  - Fine roots from both depths (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm) were subsampled; fine roots <2 mm used for morphological trait analysis; dried to determine dry root mass.

- Chemical analysis (macro- and micronutrients)
  - Samples <2 mm bulked by plot and depth across four time intervals (Nov 2017–Aug 2018).
  - After drying, samples ground for analysis.
  - Micronutrients, phosphorus, and cations analyzed by nitroperchloric digestion (Malavolta et al. 1989); K, Ca, Mg, and micronutrients by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS); total P by colorimetry; C and N by CHN analyzer.
  - Roots not identified by species; nutrient concentrations represent mean values for the community.

- Data structure (Spreadsheet details)
  - Block: 1–4 (installation blocks).
  - Plot: 1–8 (within each block).
  - TRT: eight treatments as defined (control, P, N, cations, N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations).
  - Depth: 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm.
  - Nutrient concentrations in roots: Fe, Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg, K, P, N, C.
  - Units and descriptions:
    - Fe, Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg, K, P: concentration in roots (various units, e.g., mg/kg or g/kg as specified).
    - N: nitrogen concentration in roots (%).
    - C: carbon concentration in roots (%).
  - Note: Root data reflect the community as species were not distinguished; data aggregated by plot and depth.
