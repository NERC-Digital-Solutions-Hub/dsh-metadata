# AFEX Experiment

- Location and climate: Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/ INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil; mean temp ~26°C; mean annual rainfall ~2,400 mm; humidity 75–92%.

- Experimental design: full factorial nutrient addition experiment initiated May 2017; eight treatments (control, N, P, cations [K, Mg, Ca], and combinations N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations); four replicate plots per treatment; 32 plots total across four independent blocks with at least 250 m between blocks.

- Plot layout: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central treatment area 30 m × 30 m; nutrients applied as dry granules three times per year.

- Root sampling design: in each plot, five 12 cm-diameter, 30 cm-deep root ingrowth cores installed in August 2017 within the central 30 × 30 m area; cores collected every three months; five cores per plot homogenised by plot and depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm), yielding N=64 samples per timepoint.

- Sample processing (field): roots manually extracted within 60 minutes, dried at 60°C to determine dry root mass; root-free soil reinserted after extraction.

- Subsampling and analyses: fine roots (<2 mm) subsampled from both depths; dried to determine dry mass; macro- and micronutrients analyzed on bulked root material (per plot and depth) across four time intervals (Nov 2017–Aug 2018); C and N contents also determined.

- Analytical methods: 
  - Micronutrients, P, and cations via nitroperchloric digestion (Malavolta et al. 1989);
  - Cations (K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS);
  - Phosphorus by colorimetry and spectrophotometry (UV-120-01, Shimadzu);
  - C and N by CHN elemental analyzer (Vario MAX).
  - Species not identified; nutrient concentrations represent mean of the plant community.

- Data structure (Spreadsheet details): fields include Block (1–4), Plot (1–8), TRT (treatment description), Depth (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm); measured concentrations for Fe, Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg, K, P, N, and C, with corresponding units (Fe/Zn/Mn in mg/kg; Ca/Mg/K in g/kg; N and C in %; P in g/kg).

- Temporal scope: sampling and analysis conducted from November 2017 to August 2018; data reflect responses after one year of fertilisation.

- Data quality and provenance: field homogenisation and standardized drying; documented laboratory protocols and references; data organized by plot and depth to support comparison across treatments and depths.

- Potential uses for data stewards and researchers: assessment of how nutrient additions affect root mass and root nutrient composition across soil depths; community-level nutrient dynamics in a tropical forest context; compatibility with other BDFFP AFEX datasets for integrated analyses.
