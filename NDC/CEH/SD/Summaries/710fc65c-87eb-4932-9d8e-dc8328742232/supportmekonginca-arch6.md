# Agriculture on the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) depends upon upstream water and sediment nutrients, primarily nitrate and phosphorus, delivered to the delta.

## Overview
- Objective: Evaluate climate, socioeconomic, and population impacts on the Mekong River basin and assess nutrient fluxes entering the VMD.
- Approach: Use the INCA dynamic daily-flow and water-quality model to predict future discharge and nutrient fluxes under eight future scenarios (2 climate: RCP 4.5 and 8.5; 2 socioeconomic growth: medium and high; 2 population growth: low and high).

## Modelling framework and data inputs
- INCA model outputs:
  - INCA-N: daily channel discharge, nitrate-N, ammonium-N
  - INCA-P: daily channel discharge, depth, suspended sediment concentration, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus
- Spatial and temporal scope:
  - 24 subcatchments in the Mekong River basin
  - Daily timestep
  - Baseline period 1980–2017; future projections 2018–2098
- Forcing and inputs:
  - River network topology, reach characteristics, subcatchment areas
  - Land use, rainfall, hydrological parameters (HER and soil moisture deficit)
  - HER and SMD generated by the PERSiST watershed model (daily timestep)

## Scenarios and projections
- Climate scenarios: GFDL-based RCP 4.5 (GFDL45) and RCP 8.5 (GFDL85)
- Socioeconomic scenarios: medium (MG) and high (HG) growth
- Population scenarios: low (LP) and high (HP) growth
- Combined, eight future scenarios used to project discharge and nutrient flux through the Mekong basin

## Calibration, validation, and data quality
- Calibration and validation:
  - Calibrated using observed flow and water-quality data
  - Baseline model outputs for nitrate and phosphorus derived from 1980–2017 observations
  - Validation period 1985–1990
- Quality metrics:
  - Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) for parameter uncertainty
  - Model skill assessed with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and R²
  - Reported R² > 0.63 for both INCA-N and INCA-P, indicating reasonable fit to observed data

## Outputs and data structure
- Output format:
  - CSV files with naming conventions:
    - C_GFDLXX_YYYY-YYYY_baseline_Reach_MDD.csv (N for nitrate; P for phosphorus)
    - C_GFDLXX_YYYY-YYYY_ZZWW_Reach_MDD.csv
- Abbreviations:
  - C: N = INCA-N (nitrate); P = INCA-P (phosphorus)
  - XX: GFDL45 = RCP 4.5; GFDL85 = RCP 8.5
  - YYYY-YYYY: start and end years
  - ZZWW: HG/MG for economics; HP/LP for population
- Reach coverage:
  - 24 subreaches (M01–M24) including key segments like M05-Jinghong, M08-Chiang-Saen, M11-Luang-Prabang, M14-Nong-Khai, M18-Pakse, M23-border, M24-Delta

## Data interpretation and potential uses
- Outputs provide daily discharge and nutrient flux (nitrate-N, ammonium-N; total phosphorus, SRP) to assess:
  - How climate, economic growth, and population growth shape water quantity and nutrient loading to the VMD
  - Potential policy and management implications for agricultural practices, water resources planning, and nutrient mitigation
- Outputs enable end users to explore self-serve analyses of river flow and nutrient dynamics across multiple future scenarios

## Quality assurance and documentation
- Quality control includes uncertainty analysis and parameter sensitivity (GLUE) to ensure robust model behavior
