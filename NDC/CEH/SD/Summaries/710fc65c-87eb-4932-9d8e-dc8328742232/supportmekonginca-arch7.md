# Water quality modelling of the Mekong River basin: Climate change and socioeconomics drive flow and nutrient flux changes to the Mekong Delta

## Objective
- Assess climate, socioeconomic, and population impacts on the Mekong River basin and nutrient fluxes entering the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD).
- Use the integrated catchment INCA model to predict future flow and nutrients (2018–2098) across eight scenarios derived from two climate pathways, two socioeconomic growth levels, and two population growth levels.

## Model and approach
- INCA is a dynamic daily simulation model for predicting water quantity and quality in rivers and catchments.
- Two INCA modelling pathways:
  - INCA-N: daily channel discharge, nitrate-N, ammonium-N.
  - INCA-P: daily channel discharge, depth, suspended sediment concentration, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus.
- The spatial setup allows specification of river-basin structure, reach lengths, coefficients, land use, and input pollutant loads.
- Inputs include river network topology, reach characteristics, subcatchment areas, land use, rainfall, temperature, hydrologically effective rainfall (HER), and soil moisture deficit (SMD), with HER and SMD generated by PERSiST.
- Model calibration/validation performed with observed flow and water quality data.

## Data inputs and generation
- Calibration against observed data to produce baseline model outputs for 1980–2017 (one set for nitrate, one for phosphorus).
- Validation for 1985–1990 using Nash-Sutcliffe and R²; R² values > 0.63 indicating reasonable performance.
- Future projections driven by regional climate model outputs downscaled from global models.

## Outputs and units
- Nitrate data (INCA-N):
  - Date (y-m-d), Flow (cms), Nitrate (mg/L) as nitrate-N, Ammonium (mg/L) as ammonium-N.
- Phosphorus data (INCA-P):
  - Date (y-m-d), Flow (cms), Depth (m), SSC (gm/L), TP (mg/L), SRP (mg/L).
- Outputs provided for 24 subcatchments (M01–M24) across two modelling pathways.

## Spatial structure and subcatchments
- Twenty-four subreaches in the Mekong River basin (M01–M24), including key reaches such as M05-Jinghong, M08-Chiang-Saen, M11-Luang-Prabang, M13-Vientienne, M23-border, and M24-Delta.

## Future scenarios design
- Eight future scenarios generated by combining:
  - Climate: two RCPs (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) via downscaled regional climate model outputs.
  - Economy: Medium growth (MG) and High growth (HG).
  - Population: Low (LP) and High (HP) growth.
- File naming encodes climate projection, years, and economic/population assumptions.

## File formats and naming conventions
- Baseline and future scenario CSV files:
  - C_GFDLXX_YYYY-YYYY_baseline_Reach_MDD.csv
  - C_GFDLXX_YYYY-YYYY_ZZWW_Reach_MDD.csv
- Constituent designation:
  - N = INCA nitrate modelling (INCA-N).
  - P = INCA phosphorus modelling (INCA-P).

## Quality assurance
- GLUE-based uncertainty analysis to identify key controlling parameters.
- Validation period benchmark (1985–1990) showed well-performing calibration with NSE and R² values indicating reasonable downstream flux estimates.
