# Water quality modelling of the Mekong River basin: Climate change and socioeconomics drive flow and nutrient flux changes to the Mekong Delta

- Objective
  - Evaluate how climate, socioeconomic growth, and population changes affect the Mekong River basin and the nutrient fluxes entering the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD), focusing on upstream water and sediment nutrients (nitrate and phosphorus).

- Modelling approach
  - INCA: An integrated catchment, dynamic daily simulation model for water quantity and quality in rivers and catchments.
  - Two INCA pathways:
    - INCA-N: simulates daily channel discharge and nitrate-N and ammonium-N.
    - INCA-P: simulates daily channel discharge, depth, suspended sediment, total phosphorus, and soluble reactive phosphorus.
  - Scenarios: eight future pathways derived from three binary choices
    - Climate: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5
    - Economic growth: Medium and High
    - Population growth: Low and High
  - Outputs: predicted discharge and nutrient fluxes for 24 subcatchments of the Mekong River basin.

- Data inputs and setup
  - Inputs include river network topology, reach characteristics, subcatchment areas, land use, and hydrological parameters (rainfall, temperature, hydrologically effective rainfall, soil moisture deficit).
  - HER and SMD generated by PERSiST, a watershed-scale hydrological model used with INCA.
  - Calibration/validation period: baseline 1980–2017 using observed flow and water quality data; two baseline output sets (one for nitrate, one for phosphorus).

- Model calibration and validation
  - Uncertainty analysis using GLUE (generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation) to identify key parameters.
  - Validation period: 1985–1990.
  - Performance metrics: Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and R^2; both models achieved R^2 > 0.63, indicating reasonable fit for downstream flow and nutrient flux estimates.

- Outputs and data structure
  - Outputs include daily discharge and nutrient metrics for each of the 24 subreaches under baseline and future scenarios.
  - File naming conventions for outputs:
    - C_GFDLXX_YYYY-YYYY_baseline_Reach_MDD.csv (N for nitrate; P for phosphorus)
    - C_GFDLXX_YYYY-YYYY_ZZWW_Reach_MDD.csv (future scenario)
  - Climate scenario codes (GFDL45 = RCP 4.5; GFDL85 = RCP 8.5)
  - Economic and population codes (HG = High growth; MG = Medium growth; HP = High population; LP = Low population)
  - Timeframe: baseline (1980–2017) and future projections (through 2098) at a daily timestep.

- Constituents and data recorded
  - Nitrate data (INCA-N): Date, Flow (cms), Nitrate (mg/L), Ammonium (mg/L).
  - Phosphorus data (INCA-P): Date, Flow (cms), Depth (m), Suspended sediment concentration (SSC, gm/L), Total phosphorus (TP, mg/L), Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP, mg/L).
