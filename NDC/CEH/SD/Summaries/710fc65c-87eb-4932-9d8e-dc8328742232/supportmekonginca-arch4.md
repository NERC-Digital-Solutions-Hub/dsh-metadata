# Water quality modelling of the Mekong River basin: Climate change and socioeconomics drive flow and nutrient flux changes to the Mekong Delta

- Objective
  - Evaluate how climate, socioeconomic factors, and population growth affect the Mekong River basin and assess nutrient fluxes entering the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD).

- Modelling framework and scope
  - Uses the integrated catchment (INCA) model, a dynamic daily simulation tool for predicting water quantity and quality in rivers.
  - Two INCA pathways: INCA-N (nitrate-N and ammonium-N with discharge) and INCA-P (phosphorus with discharge, depth, and sediment parameters).
  - Applied to the Mekong system to generate baseline outputs (1980–2017) and future projections (2018–2098) under eight scenarios formed by crossing climate, economic, and population conditions.

- Scenarios and inputs
  - Climate: two representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5).
  - Socioeconomics: two growth levels (medium and high).
  - Population: two growth levels (low and high).
  - Result: eight future scenario combinations across 24 subcatchments (M01–M24) and two INCA pathways (N and P).

- Data sources and input data
  - INCA inputs include river network topology, reach characteristics, subcatchment areas, land use, rainfall, hydrological parameters like hydrologically effective rainfall (HER) and soil moisture deficit (SMD).
  - HER and SMD generated by PERSiST, a watershed-scale hydrological model used with INCA.

- Calibration, validation, and quality control
  - Calibrated INCA-N and INCA-P using observed flow and water quality data; established baselines for 1980–2017 (two sets: nitrate data and phosphorus data).
  - Validation period: 1985–1990.
  - Uncertainty and performance assessment using GLUE (generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation), Nash-Sutcliffe (NSE), and R-squared (R^2).
  - Reported skill: R^2 > 0.63 for both models, indicating reasonable fit to observed discharge and flux.

- Outputs and data formats
  - Outputs include daily channel discharge, nitrate-N, ammonium-N (INCA-N); channel discharge, depth, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) (INCA-P).
  - Data are produced for 24 subreaches (M01–M24) with filenames following a defined convention (C_GFDLXX_YYYY-YYYY_baseline_Reach_MDD.csv and C_GFDLXX_YYYY-YYYY_ZZWW_Reach_MDD.csv).
  - File naming encodes: constituent (N for nitrate, P for phosphorus), climate scenario (GFDL45 or GFDL85 for RCP 4.5 or 8.5), time period, economic growth (HG or MG), and population growth (HP or LP).

- Reproducibility and documentation
  - Methodology and scenario design described in Whitehead et al. (2019) with full modelling and data context for climate change and socioeconomics driving flow and nutrient flux changes to the Mekong Delta.

- Relevance and potential uses
  - Supports assessment of nutrient flux changes to the VMD under multiple future conditions.
  - Provides a structured data framework (inputs, calibration, scenario outputs, and file conventions) to guide data management, discovery, and reuse in broader water quality and policy analyses.
