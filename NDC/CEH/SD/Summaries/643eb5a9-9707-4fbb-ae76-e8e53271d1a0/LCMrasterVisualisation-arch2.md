# Visualising UKCEH Land Cover Class using a GIS application

- Purpose: A short guide to visualising the UKCEH Land Cover Class data contained in band 1 of the 2017–2020 land cover rasters using common GIS applications. The rasters are multiband:
  - 20 m and 10 m datasets: two bands (Band 1 = Land Cover Class identifier; Band 2 = classification confidence).
  - 25 m datasets: three bands (Band 1 = dominant Land Cover Class identifier; Bands 2–3 = classification confidence).
- Scope: Guidance covers visualisation in QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, and ArcGIS Pro, focusing on rendering Band 1 with the provided colour styles.
- Visualisation workflow (per application):
  - QGIS
    - Add the raster to the project to display in the Layers panel.
    - Open Layer Properties → Symbology → Paletted/Unique Values → Band 1.
    - Use Load Style to import LCMcolours_QGIS.qml to render the classification correctly.
  - ArcGIS Desktop
    - Browse to the data folder in Catalog, expand the raster bands, and drag Band 1 into the Table of Contents.
    - Layer Properties → Symbology → Unique Values → Import → load LCMcolours.lyr.
    - OK to redraw with the correct classification.
  - ArcGIS Pro
    - Open Catalog, locate the data, expand to reveal raster bands, drag Band 1 into the Table of Contents.
    - Layer Properties → Appearance > Symbology → Unique Values (build attribute table if prompted).
    - Use the import option in the Symbology panel to load LCMcolours.lyr and redraw the map.
- Additional notes:
  - The document is a concise visualisation guide; for full data descriptions, refer to the product documentation.
  - The colour styles (LCMcolours_QGIS.qml and LCMcolours.lyr) accompany these instructions to ensure consistent classification presentation.
