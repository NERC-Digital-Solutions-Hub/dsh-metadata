# Explanatory notes

- Purpose of the Farm Scale Evaluations (FSE)
  - Set up to determine whether genetically-modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops might have significant effects on farmland wildlife due to management practices.

- Datasets collected and crops covered
  - Four crops
    - Beet
    - Maize
    - Spring-sown oilseed rape
    - Winter-sown oilseed rape
  - Data areas and data types
    - Seedbank
      - Seedbank: counts of plant species germinating from soil samples taken before planting
      - Seedbank Follow-up 1: repeat soil sample one year after initial seedbank
      - Seedbank Follow-up 2: final soil sample two years after initial seedbank
    - Vegetation in the crop
      - First-seedling: first vegetation survey before herbicide application
      - Mezzanine: Beet has an additional vegetation survey between herbicide applications on conventional vs GM sides; Winter rape has a spring survey before any herbicide
      - Post-herbicide: vegetation survey after herbicide on both conventional and GM sides
      - Final Counts: vegetation survey concurrent with biomass sampling just before harvest
      - Biomass: weeds in the crop sampled month prior to harvest
      - Seed Rain: seeds produced during the crop’s growing season
      - Follow-up 1: vegetation survey one year after the trial
      - Follow-up 2: vegetation survey two years after the trial
    - Field edge vegetation
      - Margin Attributes: physical features around the trial field edge
      - Edge Veg Cover: percent cover of non-crop vegetation in June
      - Edge Veg Flower: flowering from April to August
      - Edge Veg Seed: seed setting in July and August
      - Edge Bare Ground: percent bare ground
      - Edge Spray Damage: vegetation damage from spraying
    - Invertebrates
      - Bee and Butterfly transects: monthly counts April–August in crop and field margins
      - Pollinators: combined bee and butterfly counts
      - Crop Pests: counts of herbivores on the crop early and late in the season
      - Gastropod Search: gastropods in field margins
      - Gastropod Trap: gastropods trapped in the crop in spring and autumn
      - Pitfall: counts of surface-active invertebrates early, mid, late in the season
      - Vortis: counts of arthropods on plants in field verge and crop (early and late)
    - Additional tables
      - Date drilled
      - Herbicides applied
      - Height/Cover of weeds and crop

- File naming conventions and data structure
  - Table naming: sum_<crop>_<sample date>_<protocol> (e.g., sum_b_seedrain for Beet crop seed rain; sum_b_early_pitfall for Beet crop early-season pitfall)
  - Generic properties
    - Each row represents half-field totals (counts/biomass/mean percent cover) for a separate site
    - Group totals and species-level contributions are provided
    - Sites are linked to Defra government regions; South-eastern and Eastern England regions are aggregated for confidentiality
    - Nulls indicate missing verified data
    - Some counts shown with decimals due to calculation from a proportion of transects
  - Specific table properties
    - All crop_pest tables use a suffix of 'W+' or 'W-' to denote winged/wingless insects

- Column headings and key variables
  - Conventional vs GMHT details
    - conv_count: conventional crop count
    - conv_count_FL: conventional flowering plants
    - conv_count_GE4TL: conventional plants with ≥ 4 true leaves
    - conv_count_L4TL: conventional plants with < 4 true leaves
    - conv_count_SE: conventional seeding plants
    - gm_count: GMHT crop count
    - gm_count_FL: GMHT flowering plants
    - gm_count_GE4TL: GMHT plants with ≥ 4 true leaves
    - gm_count_L4TL: GMHT plants with < 4 true leaves
    - gm_count_SE: GMHT seeding plants
  - Crop characteristics
    - crop_cover: percent cover of the crop
    - crop_unit: C = conventional crop, GM = GM crop
    - crop_height: crop height in centimetres
  - Taxonomic and site details
    - name: species or group name (scientific or common British)
    - site_ref: site reference number (consistent across all tables)
    - Region: Defra government region or its aggregate
  - Vegetation and invertebrate metrics
    - Edge Veg Cover, Edge Veg Flower, Edge Veg Seed, Edge Bare Ground, Edge Spray Damage
    - VEG/ARTHROPOD/GASTROPOD/BB_BRC: codes for vegetation/arthropods/gastropods/Bees & Butterflies
    - weed_cover_pc: percent cover of non-crop vegetation

- How analysts might use this data
  - Compare GMHT vs conventional management effects on weeds, invertebrates, and vegetation
  - Identify correlations between seedbank dynamics, vegetation stage surveys, and invertebrate communities
  - Build site- and region-level models of ecological responses to GMHT cropping practices
  - Integrate multiple data streams (seedbank, vegetation, field margins, invertebrates) to assess broader ecological impact

- Limitations and considerations
  - Data are aggregated at half-field, site, and regional levels with confidentiality-imposed aggregation in some regions
  - Nulls indicate missing verified data; decimals may reflect partial transect coverage
  - Variation in sampling schedules across crops and survey types (e.g., Mezzanine surveys only for certain crops) may affect cross-crop comparisons
  - Some external references provide deeper methodological context for spring-sown and winter-sown crops

- Summary takeaway
  - The dataset provides a comprehensive, multi-domain collection of field-scale measurements (seedbank, crop/edge vegetation, and invertebrates) across four crop types, designed to evaluate potential wildlife effects of GMHT cropping and to support comparative analyses with conventional management practices.
