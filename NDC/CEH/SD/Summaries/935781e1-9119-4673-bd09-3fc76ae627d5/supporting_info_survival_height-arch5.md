# The road to recovery: a synthesis of outcomes from ecosystem restoration in tropical and sub-tropical Asian forests

- Purpose: A dataset accompanying Banin LF, Raine EH et al. (2023) that aggregates planted-tree survival and growth outcomes from forest restoration studies in tropical and subtropical Asia, enabling cross-site comparisons and meta-analyses.
- Scope and scale:
  - 151 studies, 176 restoration sites across South and Southeast Asia
  - 2,477 planting cases (a species at a site, under a treatment, established at a time)
  - 625 tree species (252 genera; 81 families)
  - 148 sites reported survival data; 136 sites reported height growth
  - 108 sites on mineral soils; 68 peat swamp forest sites
- Data licensing and access:
  - Sharing permitted under a Creative Commons license; datasets stored in the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC)
  - Climate and soil variables sourced from external global datasets (WorldClim and Harmonized World Soil Database) and not embedded in the EIDC data repository due to licensing
  - Supplementary datasets and provenance documented; some unpublished grey literature included via FOR-RESTOR partners
- Data provenance and extraction:
  - Systematic search up to May 15, 2021 (Web of Science); 427 references screened; 108 studies selected for the seedling dataset; 43 additional peat swamp studies included; 7 unpublished datasets contributed
  - Seedling data compiled from field planting, excluding nurseries or greenhouse studies; final seedling dataset comprises 176 restoration sites and 2,477 cases across peat swamp and mineral soils
  - Data extraction included digits from figures (WebPlotDigitizer), literature cross-checks, and taxonomic harmonization
- Data fields and variables:
  - Study and site metadata: study year, country, region, coordinates, disturbance history, restoration aim, pre-planting site condition, restoration methods, planting diversity, planting density, seed source, study duration, taxonomic names, numbers planted and monitored, planting age, planting height, census times, survival, seedling dimensions and growth
  - Derived and ancillary data: wood density (from global wood density database), climate and elevation (WorldClim), dry-season precipitation, forest type (mineral soil vs peat swamp)
  - Planting design and treatments: whether planting was mixed or single-species; planting density; presence of nurse plants; replication details
  - Disturbance and current condition classifications:
    - Disturbance types: logging, agriculture, plantation, fire, mining, draining (peat swamp only)
    - Current condition: plantation enrichment, forest enrichment, open degraded
  - Restoration purpose classifications (eight categories, Table S2)
  - Additional restoration treatments alongside planting (Table S3): removal of competition, fertilisation, protection, shading, water regulation, soil preparation, and cases with no reported restoration activities beyond planting
- Taxonomy and data quality:
  - Taxonomic names harmonized to World Flora Online; synonyms resolved; ambiguous entries discarded
  - Excluded sites where single non-native/exotic-species focus dominated
  - Seedling data include 625 species (252 genera; 81 families); common species and genera identified
  - Wood density data linked to species (and genus/family levels when necessary) to support trait analyses
- Data processing and replication for analyses:
  - Mortality analyses: Section 4 outlines generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with binomial error and complementary log-log link; random effects for site, species, and site-by-species; fixed effects including climate (mean annual temperature, elevation, dry-season precipitation), forest type, forest condition, species richness, and wood density; model selection via multi-model inference (MuMIn) with AIC; exposure time incorporated for longer-term datasets; model diagnostics (DHARMa) and marginal vs conditional R^2 reported
  - Growth rate analyses: Section 5 uses height-based annual size-standardised growth rate (AGR); comparison of linear, exponential, and Gompertz growth curves; AGR computed at reference heights (100, 200, 300 cm) within observed height range; linear mixed models (lme4) with similar fixed and random effects as mortality models; uncertainty propagation via simulation and delta-method-derived standard errors
  - Uncertainty assessment: delta method for AGR variance; comparison of within- vs between- combination variance; simulation-based sensitivity analysis to assess impact of AGR uncertainty on model outputs
- Reproducibility and accessibility:
  - Analyses supported by explicit code: script_SynthesisAnalysis_MortalityModels.R, height_ASGR_nlms.R, and related functions (e.g., height_nlm_functions.R)
  - Documentation of model structure, variable importance (importance > 0.8 for retained effects), and data processing steps to facilitate reuse and verification
- Key insights relevant to data governance and stewardship:
  - A large, multi-site, multi-species dataset with standardized mortality and growth metrics across diverse forest types and disturbance histories
  - Emphasis on metadata completeness ( disturbance type, restoration aim, prior conditions, methods, density, seed source) to enable robust cross-site analyses
  - Use of external biophysical layers (WorldClim, soil databases) to contextualize outcomes, with clear notes on licensing and data integration
  - Transparent handling of uncertainty and model validation, enabling informed reuse and meta-analyses
- Practical considerations for Data Stewards:
  - Maintain and update provenance records for each site-case, including licensing status of external data layers
  - Ensure taxonomy harmonization remains aligned with World Flora Online and related authorities; handle synonyms and ambiguous identifications consistently
  - Preserve and provide access to code and supporting material to enable reproducibility of mortality and growth analyses
  - Document any deviations or data gaps (e.g., missing population-level metrics, censoring, or inconsistent reporting) and provide guidance for imputation or exclusion criteria
  - Facilitate data discovery by capturing both peat swamp and mineral soil contexts and clearly tagging disturbances, restoration aims, and management practices
- Key challenges highlighted for data stewardship:
  - Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities for restoration data
  - Timely acquisition of datasets from diverse partners and systems
  - Ensuring standardization across heterogeneous formats, measures, and reporting styles
  - Managing very large datasets and older, non-interoperable databases
  - Balancing metadata richness with practical data collection constraints across regions
