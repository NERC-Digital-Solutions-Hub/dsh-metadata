Biomass Information and Innovation Platform Hub Site Background Information

# Overview and Aims
- UK-wide Biomass Connect platform to develop large-scale domestic biomass supply.
- Aims include providing robust, independent information on biomass feedstock performance, agronomy, economics, and environmental benefits; evaluating geographic variation; enabling knowledge sharing; and informing agricultural, environmental, and bioenergy policy.
- Eight Hub sites (up to 5 ha each) with demonstration plots (up to 11 species) and variety trials for willow, Miscanthus, and other energy grasses.
- Grounded in a publishing-like approach to create usable datasets; funded by BEIS (Client reference CEH-303).

# Hub Site Network and Site Selection
- Standardized criteria used to collate and score potential sites:
  - I) Biomass cultivation capacity
  - II) Monitoring capacity and infrastructure
  - III) Stakeholder engagement and outreach expertise
- Selection aimed for geographic spread to capture climatic variation and enable regional biomass grower reach.
- Desk-based Environmental Impact Assessments considered environmental designations and nitrate vulnerability maps.
- Sites include a mix of arable and grassland uses, with existing nearby biomass plantings and trials (e.g., Miscanthus, SRC willow, SRC poplar, Miscanthus, agroforestry).
- Landscape Character classifications and at least one site located in an AONB (BGI); detailed locational data provided in Hub Site Network tables.

# Hub Site Details
- Eight Hub sites: Aberystwyth (ABR), Auchencruive (AUC), Bio Global Industries (BGI), Boghall Farm (BHF), Cockle Park Farm (CPF), Headley Hall (HHL), Hillsborough (HLS), North Wyke (NWK).
- Site attributes:
  - Land use history: e.g., AUC, BGI, ABR often arable/grazed; BHF, ABR, CPF, HHL, HLS, NWK include grasslands.
  - Existing biomass plantings nearby: varied from extensive willow/SRC plantings to Miscanthus trials.
  - Landscape features and designations: terrain and designations (Landscape Character classes; one site in an AONB).
- Location data: site coordinates and field names documented for mapping and governance; soil and environmental designations incorporated.

# Soils Overview
- Soils across the eight sites vary due to geology, topography, and land-use history.
- Broad classifications derived from:
  - World Reference Base (WRB) soils
  - ESB Subsoil descriptions (1:50k)
  - Soil Moisture Regime (SMR)
  - Soil Nutrient Regime (SNR)
- Note: classifications may mismatch local conditions; site-specific soil characterisation to be updated with field assessments.
- Per-site examples:
  - AUC: WRB Stagnosol; ESB subsoil Riverine clay/floodplain sands; SMR 3 (Very moist); SNR 3 (Medium)
  - ABR: WRB Stagnosol; ESB subsoil Sandstone/mudstone; SMR 3; SNR 3
  - BGI: WRB Luvisol; ESB subsoil Chalk; SMR 4 (Moist); SNR 5 (Very rich)
  - BHF: WRB Cambisol; ESB subsoil Glacial till; SMR 6 (Slightly dry); SNR 3
  - CPF: WRB Stagnosol; ESB subsoil Glacial till; SMR 3; SNR 3
  - HHL: WRB Cambisol; ESB subsoil Dolostone; SMR 6 (Slightly dry); SNR 6 (Carbonate)
  - HLS: WRB Stagnosol; ESB subsoil Glacial deposits; SMR data limited for NI; SNR data limited
  - NWK: WRB Cambisol; ESB subsoil Claystone/Mudstone; SMR 3; SNR 3
- Soil data will be refined as field assessments proceed.

# Climate Overview
- Regional climate metrics (1991–2020) derived from nearest Met Office stations to each Hub site.
- Data include: max/min temperatures, frost days, sunshine, rainfall, and wind.
- Examples (per site): varied ranges in max/min temps, frost days, sunshine hours, and rainfall; some sites lack complete data (NA in places).
- Existing climate monitoring:
  - Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) installed at all sites (May–June 2023) to measure rainfall, air temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction; data downloaded monthly.
  - Ground sensors (TOMST TMS-4) measure soil moisture and temperature at 6 cm, plus air/ground temperatures at 2 cm and 15 cm; installed alongside AWS.

# Field Plots Overview
- Each Hub site hosts a mix of demonstration blocks and plots for multiple crops:
  - Two demonstration blocks of Miscanthus giganteus (MISg) and Miscanthus athena (MISa) each 0.4–0.5 ha.
  - Three smaller demonstration blocks of SRC willow (0.4–0.5 ha), SRC poplar (0.10–0.16 ha), SRF poplar (0.10–0.16 ha), and SRF Eucalyptus (0.10–0.16 ha).
  - A demonstration plot with subplots of perennial grasses (0.025 ha) and a sub-plot block for SRF species (0.031 ha).
  - Five sites also include variety trials for SRC willow, Miscanthus, and other energy grasses.
  - A designated Reference area representing ongoing land use.
- Plot layout considerations: annual crops to the south, SRC in the middle, SRF to the north to minimize shading; internal headlands and aisles planned with precise mapping.

# Crops Overview
- Eight Hub sites feature up to 11 species across plots.
- Miscanthus trials:
  - Miscanthus giganteus and Miscanthus Athena; near-commercial hybrids and controls included.
  - Miscanthus variety trials include multiple hybrids; replicated design.
- SRC willow and SRC poplar trials:
  - Willow: 6-way mixture in SRC; 36 genotypes in a dedicated willow trial.
  - Poplar: both SRC and SRF regimes, including dedicated variety trials.
- Other species:
  - Eucalyptus, Alder, Black Locust (SRF), and a range of Perennial Grasses (Reed canary grass, Switchgrass, Arundo, Sida) in demonstration blocks.
- Trial designs: replicated plots arranged in Randomised Complete Block Design; ongoing variety testing across sites.

# Instrumentation
- 8.1 Automatic Weather Stations (AWS): measure rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind; data collected monthly; installed May–June 2023.
- 8.2 Ground sensors: TOMST TMS-4 dataloggers installed at the same locations as AWS; measure soil moisture, soil temperature (6 cm), and air/ground temperatures (2 cm and 15 cm); installed May–June 2023.

# Data Stewardship Considerations
- Geographic and environmental data (site coordinates, landscape classifications, designations) are collected and documented to support governance and discovery.
- GIS and plotting tools used include Trimble Geo7x, Pathfinder, Pear GIS PT Mapper, and QGIS; shapefiles produced for plot maps and field boundaries.
- Data management implications:
  - Ensure metadata completeness (location, soil classification, climate data, instrumentation, plot layout, crop varieties).
  - Maintain data provenance and versioning as field assessments update soil and environmental characterisations.
  - Develop data sharing and portal strategies to enable discovery and reuse of hub site data and plots.
  - Monitor data quality and interoperability across systems and formats (e.g., GIS shapefiles, shapefile export/import steps).
  - Document work performed on datasets (e.g., plot plans, cropping configurations, design rationales) to support future reuse and auditing.
