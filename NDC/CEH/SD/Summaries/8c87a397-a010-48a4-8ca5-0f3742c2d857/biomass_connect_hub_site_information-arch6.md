# Biomass Information and Innovation Platform Hub Site Background Information

- Summary of purpose
  - UK-wide Biomass Connect platform to support biomass feedstock production and overcome barriers to large-scale domestic supply.
  - Deliver robust, independent information on biomass feedstock performance, agronomy, economics, and environmental benefits to landowners and managers.
  - Evaluate geographic variations and innovations, enable knowledge sharing, and inform agricultural, environmental, and bioenergy policy.
  - Establish eight Hub sites (up to 5 ha each) with demonstration plots across up to 11 species, plus variety trials for willow, Miscanthus, and other energy crops.
  - Facilitate multi-site UK-wide comparisons of biomass feedstock performance.
  - Funded by the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (formerly BEIS).

- Hub Site Network overview
  - Site selection based on standard criteria:
    - I) Biomass cultivation capacity
    - II) Monitoring infrastructure and capability
    - III) Expertise for stakeholder engagement and outreach
  - Eight geographically spread Hub sites chosen for climate variation and regional reach.
  - Site details and layout
    - Aberystwyth (ABR), Auchencruive (AUC), Bio Global Industries (BGI), Boghall Farm (BHF), Cockle Park Farm (CPF), Headley Hall (HHL), Hillsborough (HLS), North Wyke (NWK).
  - Land use and management context
    - Some sites on arable land (AUC, BHF, CPF, HHL) and others on grassland (BGI, ABR, HLS, NWK).
  - Existing nearby biomass plantings and environmental designations (e.g., BGI with SRC willow, Miscanthus trials near ABR, agroforestry near NWK).
  - Environmental screening
    - Landscape character classifications and a site-specific Environmental Impact Assessment including Nitrate Vulnerable Zone considerations.
  - Table notes
    - Landscape classifications vary by England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland.
    - One Hub site lies in an AONB (BGI).

- Soils overview
  - Spatially dispersed sites with soils influenced by geology, topography, and land-use history.
  - Initial broad soil characterisation using:
    - World Reference Base Soil (WRB)
    - ESB Subsoil description (1:50k)
    - Soil Moisture Regime (SMR)
    - Soil Nutrient Regime (SNR)
  - Acknowledgement that classifications may mismatch local conditions; field assessments will update site-specific data.
  - Site-specific soil characteristics (selected examples)
    - AUC: Stagnosol; Riverine clay/floodplain materials; very moist SMR; medium SNR.
    - ABR: Stagnosol; sandstone/mudstone subsoil; very moist SMR; medium SNR.
    - BGI: Luvisol; chalk with colluvium; moist SMR; very rich SNR.
    - BHF: Cambisol; glacial till; slightly dry SMR; medium SNR.
    - CPF: Stagnosol; glacial till; very moist SMR; medium SNR.
    - HHL: Cambisol; dolostone with colluvium; slightly dry SMR; carbonate-rich SNR.
    - HLS: Stagnosol; unconsolidated glacial deposits; data gaps for NI SMR/SNR.
    - NWK: Cambisol; claystone/mudstone; very moist SMR; medium SNR.

- Climate overview
  - Climate context (1991-2020 averages) derived from Met Office stations nearest each Hub site to support regional assessment.
  - Long-term climate metrics per site (max temp, min temp, frost days, sunshine, rainfall, days with >1 mm rain, wind).
  - Examples of site data
    - AUC: max 12.91°C, min 38.12°C (likely a formatting issue in dataset; key point includes frost days, rainfall ~165 mm, etc.).
    - ABR: frost ~38.75 days; rainfall ~1107 mm.
    - BGI, BHF, CPF, HHL, HLS, NWK with site-specific temp, frost, rainfall, sunshine, and wind data.
  - Existing climate monitoring
    - AWS (Automatic Weather Stations) installed at each Hub to capture rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind; data downloaded monthly.
    - Nearest Met Office station noted for several sites (e.g., AUC, ABR, CPF, HHL, HLS, NWK).
  - Data use
    - Supports interpretation of biomass performance and site suitability under regional climate variability.

- Field plots overview
  - Each Hub site hosts diverse field plots with multiple biomass crops and configurations.
  - Core layout across all sites
    - Two demonstration blocks of Miscanthus giganteus (MISg) and Miscanthus athena (MISa) 0.4–0.5 ha each.
    - One SRC willow block (0.4–0.5 ha) and one SRC willow with a 6-genotype mix.
    - Three smaller demonstration blocks: SRC poplar (0.10–0.16 ha), SRF poplar (0.10–0.16 ha), SRF Eucalyptus (0.10–0.16 ha).
    - Demonstration plots for perennial grasses (0.025 ha) including Reed canary grass, Switchgrass, Arundo, Sida.
    - SRF plots for Alder and Black Locust (0.031 ha each).
    - Variety trials of SRC willow, Miscanthus, and other energy grasses at five sites (ABR, BHF, HHL, HLS, NWK).
  - Reference areas at each site representing ongoing land use.
  - Plot design considerations
    - Spatial arrangement to manage shading (taller genotypes to the north) and to accommodate annual cutting patterns.
    - Plot and headland layout mapped with high-accuracy GIS tools.

- Creating site-specific plot plans and site plot maps
  - Field boundary mapping using Trimble Geo7x (2 cm accuracy, WGS84).
  - Shapefile creation with Trimble Pathfinder; some sites required alternative base maps.
  - Plot planning executed in Pear GIS PT Mapper, with consistent internal aisles and headlands.
  - Shapefiles exported and integrated into QGIS to produce final plot maps.
  - Site plot maps presented for all eight hubs in the report.

- Crops overview
  - Up to 11 species planted per Hub site across demonstration blocks and plots.
  - Key crops and configurations
    - Willow: SRC, with 0.4–0.5 ha blocks; 6-genotype SRC willow variety trials; some sites include additional willow varieties.
    - Poplar: SRC and SRF configurations (0.10–0.16 ha each).
    - Eucalyptus and Alder: SRF configurations (0.10–0.16 ha for Eucalyptus; 0.03 ha for Alder).
    - Black Locust: SRC configuration (0.03 ha).
    - Miscanthus giganteus and Miscanthus athena: 0.4–0.5 ha blocks.
    - Perennial grasses: Reed Canary Grass, Switch Grass, Arundo, Sida (0.025 ha each).

    - SRC willow: 36 genotypes; additional varieties from other research projects; replicated in RCBD design.
  - Stocking densities, spacings, and planting dates varied by site and crop.
