# Biomass Information and Innovation Platform Hub Site Background Information

- A UK-wide Biomass Connect platform was created to support large-scale domestic biomass supply by providing independent information on biomass feedstock performance, agronomy, economics, and environmental benefits to landowners and managers.
- The project aims to demonstrate geographic variation in biomass feedstocks, enable knowledge sharing and case studies across the industry, and contribute to agricultural, environmental, and bioenergy policy development.
- Eight Hub sites (each up to 5 ha) were established with demonstration plots including up to 11 species, plus variety trials for willow, Miscanthus, and other energy grasses.
- Hub sites enable best-practice agronomy demonstrations across the UK and facilitate multi-site, UK-wide comparisons of biomass feedstock performance.
- Funded by the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (formerly BEIS).

## Hub Site Network

- Sites were selected using standard criteria focused on:
  - I. Biomass cultivation capacity
  - II. Monitoring capacity and infrastructure
  - III. Expertise for stakeholder engagement and outreach
- Eight sites were chosen to provide geographic/climatic coverage and regional reach to potential biomass growers.
- Hub sites and locations:
  - Aberystwyth (ABR)
  - Auchencruive (AUC)
  - Bio Global Industries (BGI)
  - Boghall Farm (BHF)
  - Cockle Park Farm (CPF)
  - Headley Hall (HHL)
  - Hillsborough (HLS)
  - North Wyke (NWK)
- Some sites were historically arable; others were grasslands. Several sites already host biomass plantings or related trials nearby (e.g., Miscanthus, SRC willow, agroforestry, SRF plantations).
- Each hub site has landscape character classifications and environmental designations (including at least one site in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty). Desk-based Environmental Impact Assessments and nitrate vulnerability considerations were completed.

## Soils Overview

- The eight hub sites are geographically dispersed; soil characterisation uses a combination of national models/maps:
  - World Reference Base (WRB) soil classification
  - ESB Subsoil description (1:50k)
  - Soil Moisture Regime (SMR)
  - Soil Nutrient Regime (SNR)
- Site-specific soil data may be updated after field assessments to better reflect local conditions.
- Broad soil classifications per site include:
  - AUC: Stagnosol; Riverine subsoil; very moist conditions
  - ABR: Stagnosol; sandstone/mudstone; very moist
  - BGI: Luvisol; chalk; moist; very rich nutrients
  - BHF: Cambisol; glacial till; slightly dry
  - CPF: Stagnosol; glacial till; very moist
  - HHL: Cambisol; dolostone; slightly dry
  - HLS: Stagnosol; glacial deposits; data gaps for NI
  - NWK: Cambisol; claystone/mudstone; very moist
- Soil classifications are initially broad and will be refined with field data, including site-specific nutrient and moisture regimes.

## Climate Overview

- Long-term climate context (1991–2020) derived from nearest Met Office stations to each hub site to illustrate regional variation.
- Site-specific climate metrics include maximum and minimum temperatures, annual rainfall, days of frost, sunshine, and rainfall frequency.
- Existing climate monitoring infrastructure:
  - Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) installed at all sites (May–June 2023) measuring rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction; data downloaded monthly.
  - Ground sensors (TOMST TMS-4) installed at the same locations as AWS to monitor soil moisture, soil temperature (6 cm), and air/ground temperatures (2 cm and 15 cm above ground).

## Field Plots Overview

- Each Hub site hosts diverse field plots with multiple biomass crops.
- Core layout includes:
  - Two Miscanthus demonstration blocks (Miscanthus giganteus and Miscanthus athena) each 0.4–0.5 ha
  - One SRC willow block (0.4–0.5 ha)
  - Three smaller blocks for SRC poplar, SRF poplar, and SRF Eucalyptus (0.10–0.16 ha each)
  - A perennial grass panel (Reed canary grass, Switchgrass, Arundo, Sida) ~0.025 ha
  - SRF taxa (Alder, Black Locust) 0.031 ha blocks
  - Variety trials for SRC willow, Miscanthus, and other energy grasses at five sites
  - A Reference area representing ongoing land use
- Plot boundaries and features mapped with Trimble Geo7x (2 cm accuracy) and exported as shapefiles; plotting plans created in Pear GIS PT Mapper and refined in QGIS.
- Plot arrangement considerations included arranging annually cut crops to the south, SRC in the middle, and SRF to the north to minimize shading.

## Crops Overview

- Each hub site contains up to 11 species across demonstration blocks and plots.
- Crop types and setups include:
  - Willow: SRC; multiple genotypes (0.4–0.5 ha blocks); SRC willow variety trials at five sites
  - Poplar: SRC; SRF configurations (0.10–0.16 ha blocks)
  - Eucalyptus: SRF; 0.10–0.16 ha blocks
  - Alder and Black Locust: SRF; 0.03 ha blocks
  - Miscanthus giganteus and Miscanthus Athena: grass blocks; 0.4–0.5 ha each
  - Other energy grasses: Reed Canary Grass, Switch Grass, Arundo, Sida (smaller blocks)
- Miscanthus and SRC willow variety trials include multiple commercially relevant hybrids and genotypes; trials use randomized complete block designs with replication.

## Instrumentation

- Each Hub site includes:
  - Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) for local climate data (rainfall, air temperature, humidity, wind, direction); data retrieved monthly; installed May–June 2023.
  - Ground sensors (TOMST TMS-4 dataloggers) co-located with AWS to measure soil moisture and temperature at 6 cm depth, plus temperature at 2 cm and 15 cm above ground; installed May–June 2023.
