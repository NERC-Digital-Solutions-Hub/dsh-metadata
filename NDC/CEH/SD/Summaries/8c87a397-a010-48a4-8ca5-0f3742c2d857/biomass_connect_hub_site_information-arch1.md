# Biomass Information and Innovation Platform Hub Site Background Information

- Overview
  - Biomass Connect created a UK-wide platform to tackle barriers to large-scale domestic biomass supply.
  - Aims include providing robust, independent information on biomass feedstock performance, agronomy, economics and environmental benefits; evaluating geographic variations; enabling knowledge sharing; and contributing to policy development.
  - Eight Hub sites (each up to 5 ha) with demonstration plots across up to 11 species, plus variety trials for willow, Miscanthus, and other energy grasses.
  - Hub sites enable best-practice agronomy demonstrations and multi-site UK-wide comparisons of biomass feedstock performance.
  - Funded by the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (formerly BEIS).

## 2 Hub Site Network

- Site selection and evaluation
  - Standardized information collected and scored against objective criteria:
    - I) Biomass cultivation capacity
    - II) Monitoring capacity and infrastructure
    - III) Expertise for stakeholder engagement and outreach
  - Criteria supported a geographically spread network to capture climatic variation and reach potential biomass growers.
- Hub sites and locations
  - Aberystwyth (ABR), Auchencruive (AUC), Bio Global Industries (BGI), Boghall Farm (BHF), Cockle Park Farm (CPF), Headley Hall (HHL), Hillsborough (HLS), North Wyke (NWK)
  - Site details include location, owner, coordinates, elevation, and landscape context.
- Land use and existing biomass plantings
  - Some sites are long-term arable (AUC, BGI, CPF, HHL) while others are grassland (BGI, ABR, HLS, NWK).
  - Several sites already host biomass plantings or nearby plantations (e.g., willow, Miscanthus, SRC willow, agroforestry).
- Landscape context and assessments
  - Each site linked to a Landscape Character classification; one site within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (BGI).
  - Desk-based Environmental Impact Assessments considered site designations and nitrate vulnerability.

## 3 Soils Overview

- Geographic dispersion and soil characterization
  - Soils differ due to geology, topography, and land-use history; initial broad classifications derived from national models/maps.
- Classification frameworks
  - WRB (World Reference Base) soil types
  - ESB Subsoil descriptions (1:50k)
  - Soil Moisture Regimes (SMR)
  - Soil Nutrient Regimes (SNR)
- Note on scale
  - Classifications may mismatch local conditions; site-specific soil characterisation will be updated with field assessments as work progresses.
- Site-specific soil highlights
  - AUC: Stagnosol; riverine subsoil; very moist; medium nutrient regime
  - ABR: Stagnosol; sandstone/mudstone subsoil; very moist; medium
  - BGI: Luvisol; chalk-derived; moist; very rich
  - BHF: Cambisol; glacial till; slightly dry; medium
  - CPF: Stagnosol; glacial till; very moist; medium
  - HHL: Cambisol; dolostone, slightly dry; carbonate
  - HLS: Stagnosol; glacial deposits; data on NI SMR/SNR limited
  - NWK: Cambisol; claystone/mudstone; very moist; medium

## 4 Climate Overview

- Regional climate context
  - Long-term climate metrics (1991–2020) from nearest Met Office stations used to characterize each hub site.
- Climate indicators
  - Max/min temperatures, annual frost days, sunshine hours, rainfall, days with rainfall >1 mm, and wind speed.
  - Site-specific values provided (varies by location).
- Climate monitoring infrastructure
  - Each site linked to the nearest Met Office station (where applicable) or noted as outside a 5 km radius.

## 5 Field Plots Overview

- Plot composition and crop types
  - All eight sites include:
    - Two demonstration blocks of Miscanthus giganteus (MISg) and Miscanthus athena (MISa)
    - One SRC willow block (0.4–0.5 ha)
    - Three smaller blocks of SRC poplar, SRF poplar, and SRF Eucalyptus (0.10–0.16 ha each)
    - A perennial grasses plot (e.g., Reed canary grass, Switchgrass, Arundo; 0.025 ha)
    - An SRF sub-plots plot (Alder, Paulownia, Black Locust; 0.031 ha)
  - Five sites (BHF, ABR, HHL, HLS, NWK) include variety trials for SRC willow, Miscanthus, and other energy grasses.
  - A designated Reference area at each site representing ongoing land use.
- Layout notes
  - Field plots designed to enable comparative assessment across sites; annual crops oriented to minimize shading by placing taller genotypes to the north.

## 6.1 Creating Site-Specific Plot Plans

- Mapping approach
  - UK Mainland sites: field boundaries and features mapped with Trimble Geo7x (2 cm accuracy, WGS84).
  - Data processed into shapefiles via Trimble Pathfinder, then imported into Pear GIS PT Mapper to create plot maps.
  - For Hillsborough (HLS) in Northern Ireland, a pre-existing base map was used instead of Pathfinder.
- Plot plan design principles
  - Plot areas created within field boundaries with a 12 m headland offset.
  - Crop placement strategy to optimize light/shading (south for annuals, middle for SRC, north for SRF).
  - External lines defined to ensure adequate aisles; redundant features removed; plots labeled.
  - Shapefiles exported and imported into QGIS for final plot mapping.

## 6.2 Site Plot Maps

- Plot maps for all eight Hub sites are included in this document (pages referenced).

## 7 Crops Overview

- Species and trial design
  - Up to 11 species per site across demonstration blocks and plots.
  - Miscanthus (six hybrids plus two controls: M. giganteus, M. Athena) and SRC willow trials present at multiple sites.
  - SRC willow, SRC poplar, SRF poplar, and SRF Eucalyptus included; additional perennials (Reed Canary Grass, Sida, Switch Grass, Arundo) featured.
  - Variety trials include Miscanthus, willow, and other energy grasses with replicated plots in a Randomised Complete Block Design.
- Plot areas by crop type
  - Willow (SRC), Poplar (SRC/SRF), Eucalyptus (SRF), Alder, Black Locust
  - Miscanthus giganteus and Miscanthus Athena with substantial plot areas
  - Perennial grasses and other grasses with smaller plots

## 8 Instrumentation

- 8.1 Automatic Weather Stations (AWS)
  - AWS installed at each hub to capture rainfall, air temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction.
  - Data downloaded monthly; installation occurred May–June 2023.
- 8.2 Ground sensors
  - TOMST TMS-4 dataloggers installed at the same locations as AWS.
  - Measure soil moisture and temperature at 6 cm depth; air/ground temperature at 2 cm and 15 cm heights.
  - Installation May–June 2023.
