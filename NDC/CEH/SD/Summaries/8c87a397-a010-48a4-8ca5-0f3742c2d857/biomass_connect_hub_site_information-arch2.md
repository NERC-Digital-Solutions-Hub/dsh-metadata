# Biomass Information and Innovation Platform Hub Site Background Information

## 1 Summary
- Biomass Connect created a UK-wide platform to support large-scale domestic biomass supply, providing robust information on biomass feedstock performance, agronomy, economics and environmental benefits for landowners and land managers.
- Aims include evaluating geographic variation, sharing knowledge and case studies, and informing agricultural, environmental and bioenergy policy.
- Eight Hub sites (up to 5 ha each) with demonstration plots (up to 11 species, plus willow, Miscanthus and other energy grasses trials) to enable multi-site UK-wide comparisons of biomass feedstock performance.
- Hub sites were selected to maximise biomass cultivation capacity, monitoring infrastructure, and stakeholder engagement, with deliberate geographic spread to capture climatic variation and regional reach.
- The document provides background on the choice and establishment of the eight Hub sites and notes BEIS (formerly BEIS/DECC) funding.

## 2 Hub Site Network
- Site selection used standardised information and objective criteria across: I) biomass cultivation capacity, II) monitoring capacity/infrastructure, III) stakeholder engagement/outreach.
- Eight sites chosen to maximise scores on these criteria and to provide geographic/climatic coverage.
- Locations: Aberystwyth (ABR), Auchencruive (AUC), Bio Global Industries (BGI), Boghall Farm (BHF), Cockle Park Farm (CPF), Headley Hall (HHL), Hillsborough (HLS), North Wyke (NWK).
- Several sites sit on long-standing arable or grassland land; nearby existing biomass plantings or trials noted (e.g., Miscanthus at ABR; SRC willow near CPF; willow plantations at HLS; agroforestry at NWK; BGI includes willow, poplar, Eucalyptus).
- Landscape designations and environmental assessments: associated with Landscape Character classifications; one site located in an AONB (BGI); desk-based Environmental Impact Assessments undertaken.

## 3 Soils Overview
- Soils across Hub sites are diverse, influenced by geology, topography and land-use history.
- Broad classifications used for initial site characterization:
  - World Reference Base (WRB) soil classes
  - ESB Subsoil description
  - Soil Moisture Regime (SMR)
  - Soil Nutrient Regime (SNR)
- Field assessments will update soil characterisation to reflect local conditions.
- Site-specific summaries include WRB, ESB subsoil descriptions, SMR and SNR values (e.g., AUC: Stagnosol; BGI: Luvisol; BHF: Cambisol; CPF: Stagnosol; HHL: Cambisol; NWK: Cambisol; HLS: Stagnosol; ABR: Stagnosol).

## 4 Climate Overview
- Regional climate context drawn from Met Office long-term data (1991–2020) from stations nearest each Hub site.
- For each site, metrics include maximum/minimum temperatures, frost days, sunshine hours, annual rainfall, and rainfall days per year.
- Nearest Met stations vary by site (e.g., AUC, ABR, CPF, HHL, HLS, NWK, etc.), with some stations providing precise readings and others referencing nearby stations.
- This climate data underpins interpretation of biomass performance and site-specific management needs.

## 5 Field Plots Overview
- Each Hub site includes multiple field plots with diverse biomass crops.
- Common features across sites:
  - Two demonstration blocks of Miscanthus giganteus (MISg) and Miscanthus Athena (MISa)
  - One SRC willow block (Willow, 0.4–0.5 ha)
  - Three smaller blocks: SRC poplar, SRF poplar, SRF Eucalyptus (0.10–0.16 ha each)
  - A perennial grasses block (Reed canary grass, Switch grass, Arundo, Sida) (0.025 ha)
  - A SRF block including Alder and Black Locust (0.031 ha)
  - Five sites also include SRC willow, Miscanthus and other energy-grasses variety trials
  - Each site has a designated Reference area representing ongoing land use
- Field plots were designed to enable comparisons across crops and management regimes.

## 6.1 Creating site-specific plot plans
- Field boundaries and internal features mapped with a Trimble Geo7x (2 cm accuracy, WGS84).
- Data processed to create shapefiles via Trimble Pathfinder.
- Plot plans produced in Pear GIS PT Mapper; headlands and aisles planned (e.g., inner 12 m offset to regulate shading).
- External lines used to allocate aisles; plan exports converted to shapefiles and imported into QGIS to produce final plot maps.

## 6.2 Site plot maps
- Plot maps for all eight Hub sites are included in the document (maps presented on subsequent pages).

## 7 Crops Overview
- Each Hub site hosts up to 11 species across demonstration blocks and plots.
- Trials include Miscanthus varieties (six hybrids plus two controls: M. giganteus and M. Athena), SRC willow (36 genotypes), SRC poplar, SRF poplar, SRF Eucalyptus, Alder, Black Locust, and a range of perennial grasses (Reed canary grass, Switch grass, Arundo, Sida).
- Most trials use replicated plots with a Randomised Complete Block Design.
- Additional variety trials exist at five sites (ABR, BHF, HHL, HLS, NWK) including energy grasses and SRC willow trials.
- Plot areas vary by crop type (e.g., Miscanthus blocks ~0.4–0.5 ha; SRC willow blocks ~0.4–0.5 ha; other crops ~0.03–0.16 ha per plot).

## 8 Instrumentation
- 8.1 Automatic Weather Stations (AWS): deployed at each Hub site (May–June 2023) to measure rainfall, air temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction; monthly data downloads.
- 8.2 Ground sensors: TOMST TMS-4 dataloggers deployed at the same locations as AWS to monitor soil moisture and temperature (at 6 cm depth) and air temperatures at 2 cm and 15 cm above ground; installed May–June 2023.
