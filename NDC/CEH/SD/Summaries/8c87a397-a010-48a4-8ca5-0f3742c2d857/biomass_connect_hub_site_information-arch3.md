# Biomass Information and Innovation Platform Hub Site Background Information

## Summary
- Purpose: Build a UK-wide platform (Biomass Connect) to provide robust, independent information on biomass feedstock performance, agronomy, economics and environmental benefits; showcase geographic variation; enable knowledge sharing; and contribute to policy development.
- Structure: Eight Hub sites (each up to 5 ha) with demonstration plots across up to 11 species, plus variety trials for willow, Miscanthus and other energy grasses; enables multi-site, UK-wide comparison of biomass feedstock performance.
- Funding: Project funded by the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (BEIS).

## Hub Site Network
- Selection approach: Standardized information collected and scored against objective criteria:
  - I) Biomass cultivation capacity
  - II) Monitoring capacity and infrastructure
  - III) Expertise for stakeholder engagement and outreach
- Eight sites chosen to maximize scores and provide geographic/climate variation across the UK.
- Hub sites (location and affiliations): Aberystwyth (ABR), Auchencruive (AUC), Bio Global Industries (BGI), Boghall Farm (BHF), Cockle Park Farm (CPF), Headley Hall (HHL), Hillsborough (HLS), North Wyke (NWK).
- Site characteristics: Mix of arable and grassland previous uses; proximity to existing biomass plantings; landscape classifications; some sites located in areas with special designations (e.g., one in an AONB); environmental assessments and nitrate vulnerability zoning completed.
- Site-specific environmental designations and assessments fed into site planning and monitoring.

## Soils Overview
- Geographic dispersion leads to soil variation driven by geology, topography and land-use history.
- Broad classifications used for initial hub-site characterization (WRB, ESB subsoil descriptions, Soil Moisture Regime, Soil Nutrient Regime); field assessments will update these as work progresses.
- Site-by-site soil snapshots (representative): 
  - Auchencruive (AUC): WRB Stagnosol; ESB subsoil riverine clay/floodplain sands; SMR 3; SNR 3.
  - Aberystwyth (ABR): WRB Stagnosol; ESB subsoil sandstone/mudstone; SMR 3; SNR 3.
  - Bio Global Industries (BGI): WRB Luvisol; ESB subsoil chalk with colluvium; SMR 4; SNR 5.
  - Boghall Farm (BHF): WRB Cambisol; ESB subsoil glacial till; SMR 6; SNR 3.
  - Cockle Park Farm (CPF): WRB Stagnosol; ESB subsoil glacial till; SMR 3; SNR 3.
  - Headley Hall (HHL): WRB Cambisol; ESB subsoil dolostone with colluvium; SMR 6; SNR 6.
  - Hillsborough (HLS): WRB Stagnosol; ESB subsoil unconsolidated glacial deposits; SMR NA; SNR NA (NI data gaps).
  - North Wyke (NWK): WRB Cambisol; ESB subsoil claystone/mudstone; SMR 3; SNR 3.
- Note: Local soil conditions will be refined with ongoing field assessments.

## Climate Overview
- Regional climate context drawn from long-term metrics (1991–2020) using nearest Met Office stations.
- Data encompass max/min temperatures, frost days, sunshine, rainfall, rainfall days, and wind characteristics; station proximity varies by site.
- Existing climate monitoring infrastructure:
  - Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) deployed at all Hub sites (installed May–June 2023) to record rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction.
  - Ground sensors (TOMST TMS-4 dataloggers) installed at the same locations to monitor soil moisture and temperature at multiple depths/heights.
- Nearest Met stations and data availability vary by site.

## Field Plots Overview
- Each Hub site includes diverse field plots with biomass crops:
  - Two demonstration blocks of Miscanthus giganteus (MISg) and Miscanthus athena (MISa).
  - One SRC willow block (0.4–0.5 ha).
  - Three smaller demonstration blocks: SRC poplar (POP), SRF poplar, SRF eucalyptus (EUC) (0.10–0.16 ha each).
  - Demonstration plots for perennial grasses (Reed canary grass, Switch Grass, Arundo, Sida) (~0.025 ha each).
  - SRF blocks with Alder, Paulownia, Black Locust (~0.031 ha each).
  - Five sites include additional variety trials for SRC willow, Miscanthus and other energy grasses.
  - Reference areas at each site to represent ongoing land use.
- Layout considerations: Design and plot arrangement aim to capture representative practices and minimize shading effects.

## Creating Site-Specific Plot Plans
- Field boundary and features mapped with Trimble Geo7x (2 cm accuracy, WGS84).
- Data processed into shapefiles via Trimble Pathfinder; for Hillsborough (HLS) NI site, a pre-existing base map was used.
- Plot planning performed in Pear GIS PT Mapper; headlands set 12 m inside field perimeters; tall crops positioned to the north to reduce shading.
- Internal aisles and external parallels created to ensure adequate space; shapefiles exported and imported into QGIS to generate plot maps.

## Site Plot Maps
- Plot maps are produced and presented for all eight Hub sites (details and layouts provided in the corresponding sections of the document).

## Crops Overview
- Up to 11 species per site across demonstration blocks and plots.
- Variety trials:
  - Miscanthus: six near-commercial hybrids plus two controls (M. giganteus and M. Athena).
  - SRC willow: 36 genotypes.
  - Most trials include around 31 varieties; five additional test varieties sourced from University of Surrey Lot 1.
- Crops and plots organized in randomized complete block designs to enable robust comparison.

## Instrumentation
- 8.1 Automatic Weather Stations (AWS)
  - Measure rainfall, air temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction.
  - Data downloaded monthly; stations installed May–June 2023.
- 8.2 Ground Sensors
  - TOMST TMS-4 dataloggers deployed at the AWS locations.
  - Record soil moisture and temperature at 6 cm depth; air/ground temperatures at 2 cm and 15 cm above ground.
  - Installed May–June 2023.
