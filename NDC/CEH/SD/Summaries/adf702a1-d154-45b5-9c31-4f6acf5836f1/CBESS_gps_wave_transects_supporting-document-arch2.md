# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) GPS locations for instruments and features associated with wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table installations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

## Overview and purpose
- Provides global-positioning system (GPS) locations for instruments and features used in wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table (SET) installations within saltmarsh and mudflat habitats.
- Documents surface elevation relative to rod SET (rSET) instruments and depths of sediment deposited above feldspar marker horizons adjacent to rSET benchmarks.
- Enables inter-comparison across CBESS sites and supports time-series analyses of coastal elevation and sedimentation.

## Study sites and habitat contrasts
- Essex, UK: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM) representing saltmarsh and mudflat habitats with clay soils and higher inundation variability.
- Morecambe Bay, UK: Cartmel Sands (CS) representing sandy soils and different inundation/creek structures.
- Two broad habitat soil contrasts:
  - Saltmarsh: clay soils (Essex) vs. sandy soils (Morecambe Bay).
  - Mudflats: cohesive clays/mud/silt (Essex) vs. coarse, mobile sediments (Morecambe Bay).

## Monitoring design and instrumentation
- Monitoring stations installed in autumn 2012 using rod surface elevation tables (rSET) for standardised, globally comparable measurements.
- SET benchmarks placed with receivers bolted to rods, top of rod cemented into drains; benchmarks driven deep into substrate (typically 6–12 m).
- Nine pins deployed in each of four quadrants around each benchmark to record height changes.
- 50 cm by 50 cm feldspar marker horizons installed just beyond instrument reach to measure sediment deposition depth above horizon.
- Observations collected approximately every 3–6 months over monitoring periods; twice during the 1-year monitoring period.

## Data collection and variables
- Primary variables:
  - Heights at Pin 1–9 around each SET benchmark.
  - Horizon depths at Core 1–3 beneath marker horizons.
- Additional fields captured in dataset headers:
  - Seasonal timing, location (site, habitat), quadrat, scale, and record numbers.
  - SET number, readings for each pin, depths for each marker horizon, and notes/comments.
- Accuracy and reference:
  - GPS coordinates with OSGB1936 reference; accuracy better than 50 mm in all directions.
  - Calibration via Leica RTK corrections in real time.
  - Methodology anchored to Cahoon et al. (2002) on high-precision wetland sediment elevation measurements.

## Data management and formats
- Data collected and entered into Excel spreadsheets.
- Dataset fields include:
  - Descriptive headers (Description, Row number, Date, Time, Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Quadrat, Scale, Record).
  - Measurements (SET Number, Pin 1–9 readings, Marker horizon depths for Core 1–3).
  - Notes/comments for readings.
- GPS locations of benchmarks and marker horizons are included in the associated dataset CBESS_gps_wave_transects.

## Quality assurance and references
- Uses established SET protocol to enable inter-site comparability and data quality assurance.
- Base procedures and calibrations align with widely cited standards (Cahoon et al., 2002; USGS SET framework).

## Practical relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized, high-resolution time-series data on coastal elevation change and sedimentation, essential for assessing coastal resilience and ecosystem service sustainability.
- Facilitates data sharing and portal uploads, supporting broader environmental health assessments and policy performance monitoring.
- Addresses key challenges for analysts: increasing dataset value through cross-site integration and enabling access to underlying data for broader analysis.
