# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) GPS locations for instruments and features associated with wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table installations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

## Overview
- Describes GPS locations and related observational data for rod surface elevation table (rSET) instruments and feldspar marker horizons across saltmarsh and mudflat habitats.
- Aims to enable inter-comparability within the CBESS global monitoring network and support assessments of coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services.

## Geographic scope and habitats
- Locations: Essex (Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes) and Morecambe Bay (Cartmel Sands).
- Habitats: Saltmarsh (contrasting soil types: clay in Essex; sandy in Morecambe Bay) and mudflat (Essex: cohesive clays; Morecambe Bay: coarse, mobile sediments).
- Coordinates provided with high positional accuracy (GPS locations better than 50 mm in all directions; OSGB1936).

## Data collected and observations
- Instrumentation: Rod Surface Elevation Table (rSET) with receivers mounted on benchmark rods; cemented into place.
- Marker horizons: 50 cm x 50 cm potash feldspar horizons placed near but beyond instrument arm reach.
- Timeframe: Observations conducted twice over a 1-year monitoring period; core sampling and horizon depth measurements along multiple quadrants.
- Variables recorded:
  - Heights at five to nine pins per SET (Pin 1–9).
  - Depths of sediment above horizon at up to three cores (Core 1–3).
  - SET number (inland sequence) and location metadata.
  - Additional notes on readings and potentially significant factors affecting results.

## Methodology and data quality
- Installation: Autumn 2012; standardised rSET methodology allows cross-site comparability.
- Procedures: Nine pins measured in four quadrants around each benchmark; horizons cores measured with mean depth calculations when cores are not horizontal.
- Accuracy and calibration: GPS coordinates referenced to Leica GNSS with RTK corrections in real time; accuracy better than 50 mm.
- Data handling: Data entered in Excel spreadsheets; NA values denote measurements not performed; detailed dataset field descriptions provided.
- Documentation and references: Observations and methods supported by Cahoon et al. (2002) on high-precision wetland sediment elevation measurements.

## Dataset structure and formats
- Primary data format: Excel spreadsheets.
- Dataset field schema includes: season, location (Morecambe or Essex), site, habitat, quadrat, scale, record number, date, time, SET number, Pin readings (Pin 1–9), horizon depths (Core 1–3), notes, and additional dataset fields (e.g., header and row metadata).
- Associated data: GPS coordinates are contained in the related dataset "CBESS_gps_wave_transects".

## Personnel and governance
- Staff responsible: Tom Spencer, Ben Evans.
- Data governance focus: standardized instrumentation, detailed field descriptions, metadata completeness (including coordinates, instrument details, and measurement procedures) to enable discoverability, reuse, and cross-network collaboration.

## Relevance for data leadership
- Demonstrates a well-documented, standards-based approach to coastal monitoring data, with explicit provenance, instrumentation, and spatial metadata.
- Highlights importance of coordinating across sites to ensure data compatibility, quality control, and accessibility for policy colleagues and wider data communities.
- Reflects common data challenges identified for data leaders (metadata rich, data gaps in certain depths/habitat types) and the value of clear data formats (Excel) and referenced standards for inter-network comparability.
