# Impact of environmental radiation on the health and reproductive status of fish from Japan, 2017

- Objective
  - Assess effects of radiation on cataract formation in carps and largemouth bass.
  - Assess effects of radiation on reproductive status in carps.

- Study design and scope
  - Sampling date: 8 May 2017; duration 10 days
  - Target species: crucian carp, common carp, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass
  - Lakes included: Suzuuchi (SU), Funazawa (FZ), Kashiramori (KM), Abakuma
  - Specific sampling site: Abukuma River, Shinobu Dam (coordinates provided)

- Methods
  - Fish collection: adult bass of consistent size (total length 17–22 cm) for uniform age; carp across a size range (total length 20–30 cm) to target F0 and F1 generations
  - Measurements and ages: measured and weighed; scales and otoliths removed for age determination
  - Gonads: dissected, weighed, fixed in buffered formalin for 24 h, preserved in ethanol
  - Data recording: standardized data collection with potential blank fields when measurements were not recorded

- Data structure and variables (japan_biometry.csv)
  - Site: Lake (geographical region)
  - Site, Units_or_methodology: Geographical region
  - Species, Explanation: Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Crucian carp (Carassius carassius), Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), Carp KOI (Cyprinus sp.)
  - Species, Units_or_methodology: as above

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and analysis
  - Provides standardized measurements and a structured dataset to evaluate radiation-related health and reproductive endpoints in fish over time.
  - Facilitates quality assurance, data cleaning, and cross-site comparisons through clearly defined variables and unit conventions.
  - Supports integration with other environmental datasets to enhance monitoring value and accessibility of underlying data for broader analysis.
