# Impact of environmental radiation on the health and reproductive status of fish from Japan, 2017

- Aim
  - Assess the effects of radiation on cataract formation in carps and largemouth bass
  - Assess the effects of radiation on the reproductive status of carps

- Study design and sampling
  - Sampling date: 8 May 2017 (duration 10 days)
  - Target species: crucian carp, common carp, smallmouth bass
  - Lakes/sites: Suzuuchi (SU); Funazawa (FZ); Kashiramori (KM); Abakuma
  - Abukuma River Shinobu Dam site coordinates: 37°42'21.28"N, 140°30'07.03"E

- Methods (summary)
  - Collect adult fish of similar size (largemouth bass 17–22 cm; carps 20–30 cm to target F0/F1 generations)
  - Dissections: gonads weighed, fixed in buffered formalin for 24 h, preserved in ethanol
  - Age determination from scales/otoliths; record body measurements and weights
  - Measurements include: BL (body length), SL (standard length), TL (total length), GW1 (gonad weight), GW2 (second gonad weight for males), Sex, Liver weight

- Data structure: japan_biometry.csv
  - Site / Site Units: Lake / geographical region
  - Species / Units: Fish species (e.g., C. carpio, C. carassius, M. salmoides, M. dolomieu, Cyprinus sp.)
  - Weight: Total fish weight (grams)
  - BL, SL, TL: Length measurements (centimetres)
  - GW1, GW2: Gonad weights (grams; blank indicates not recorded)
  - Sex: M/F (blank if not identified)
  - Liver weight: (grams; blank if not recorded)

- Governance considerations for Data Stewards
  - Metadata provides detailed field explanations, units, and data types to support interoperability
  - Clear naming for sites, species, and measurements; explicit handling of missing data (blank fields)
  - Dataset combines multiple species and sites, enabling broad analyses but requiring consistent standardization
  - Licensing not specified; data accessible via DOI—verify reuse rights and citation requirements
  - Data quality considerations: address incomplete fields and ensure provenance and update mechanisms are clear

- Provenance and potential reuse
  - Study is methodologically documented with objectives and standardized measurements, suitable for secondary analyses on radiation effects on fish health and reproduction
