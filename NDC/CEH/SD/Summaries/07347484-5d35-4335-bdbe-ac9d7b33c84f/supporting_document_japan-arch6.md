# Impact of environmental radiation on the health and reproductive status of fish from Japan, 2017

## Overview
- Study evaluating the impact of environmental radiation on cataract formation in carps and largemouth bass, and on reproductive status in carps.
- Sampling conducted during May 2017 over a 10-day period.
- Target species: crucian carp, common carp, and smallmouth bass.
- Sampling sites: Suzuuchi (SU), Funazawa (FZ), Kashiramori (KM), Abakuma (with Shinobu Dam sampling point coordinates provided for Abukuma River).

## Study design and data collection
- Fish selection: adult largemouth bass of 17–22 cm total length; carps 20–30 cm total length to target two generations (F0 and F1) when possible.
- Procedures: fish collected, euthanised, measured; scales and otoliths removed for age estimation; gonads dissected, weighed, fixed in buffered formalin for 24 hours, then preserved in ethanol.
- Data collection aims: assess cataract formation and reproductive status related to environmental radiation exposure.

## Data structure: japan_biometry.csv
- Site: Lake (geographical region reference).
- Site/Units_or_methodology: Geographical region.
- Species: 
  - Common carp Cyprinus carpio
  - Crucian Carassius carassius
  - Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides
  - Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu
  - Carp KOI Cyprinus sp.
- Weight: total fish weight (grams).
- BL (body length): length up to start of tail (centimetres).
- SL (snout-to-tail fork length): length up to fork of tail (centimetres).
- TL (total length): total fish length (centimetres).
- GW1: gonad weight (grams); may be blank if not recorded.
- GW2: second gonad weight for males only (grams); may be blank if not recorded.
- Sex: sex of fish; may be blank if not identified (M/F).
- Liver weight: liver weight (grams); may be blank if not recorded.

Note: Some fields may be blank indicating missing or unrecorded data.

## Data access and reuse
- Dataset available at: https://doi.org/10.5285/07347484-5d35-4335-bdbe-ac9d7b33c84f

## How this data can be used
- Analyses of radiation-related health effects in fish (cataract formation) and reproductive status across multiple sites and species.
- Comparative analyses between species (carps vs bass) and across lake sites, including the Abukuma River/Shinobu Dam coordinate data.
- Temporal and generation-based considerations (F0 vs F1) for carp populations.
- Data can be integrated with other environmental datasets to explore correlations with radiation exposure or other stressors.

## Limitations and considerations
- Some measurements are missing (GW2, Sex, Liver weight, etc.), as indicated by blank fields.
- Sampling occurred over a 10-day period in 2017; longitudinal or seasonal effects are not captured beyond this window.
- Precise age estimation and body condition rely on age and measurement data available in the CSV.
