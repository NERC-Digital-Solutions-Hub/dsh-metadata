# Impact of environmental radiation on the health and reproductive status of fish from Japan, 2017

## Objectives
- Assess potential effects of radiation on cataract formation in carps and largemouth bass.
- Assess potential effects of radiation on the reproductive status of carps.

## Study design and sampling
- Sampling date: May 8–17, 2017 (10 days).
- Target species: crucian carp, common carp, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass.
- Lakes/sites: Suzuuchi (SU); Funazawa (FZ); Kashiramori (KM); Abakuma.
- Abukuma River site (Shinobu Dam) coordinates: 37°42'21.28"N, 140°30'07.03"E (not shown on map).

## Data collected and measurements
- Specimens: adult fish of similar size for largemouth bass (total length 17–22 cm) and variable sizes for carps (total length 20–30 cm) to target F0 and F1 generations.
- Measurements and preparations: measured and weighed; scales and otoliths removed for age determination; gonads dissected, weighed, fixed in buffered formalin for 24 hours, then preserved in ethanol.
- Variables recorded (as described in japan_biometry.csv):
  - Site (Lake/region)
  - Species (e.g., common carp, crucian carp, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, koi carp)
  - Weight (grams)
  - BL (body length to start of tail; cm)
  - SL (snout-to-tail fork length; cm)
  - TL (total length; cm)
  - GW1 (gonad weight; grams)
  - GW2 (second gonad weight for males; grams)
  - Sex (M or F; blanks indicate unknown)
  - Liver weight (grams)
- Notes: blanks indicate data not recorded.

## Data structure and metadata
- Data file: japan_biometry.csv
- Data fields include explanations and units/methodology for each variable; missing values indicate non-recorded measurements.
- Age data obtained from scales/otoliths; method details provided.

## Data access and reuse
- Data can be accessed at: https://doi.org/10.5285/07347484-5d35-4335-bdbe-ac9d7b33c84f

## Potential analyses and considerations for data use
- Use gonad weights (GW1, GW2) and total lengths to assess reproductive status relative to fish size and age.
- Compare measures across sites (SU, FZ, KM, Shinobu Dam) to explore spatial patterns potentially linked to environmental radiation.
- Validate cataract-related observations against tumor/gonad metrics if additional phenotype data are available.
- Data gaps and caveats:
  - Sample sizes and exact age distributions are not specified here.
  - Some fields are blank, indicating missing measurements.
  - Data span is limited to a 10-day sampling period in 2017 and to four sites, which may limit broader generalizations.
- Data provenance and quality:
  - Measurements standardized (same size range for some species; age via scales/otoliths).
  - Data structure includes explicit units and methodology for reproducibility and potential integration with other datasets.
