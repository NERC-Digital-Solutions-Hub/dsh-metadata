# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- It relies on volunteers and long-term, site-based monitoring to produce annual data on butterfly population status.
- The scheme has operated since 1976, currently recording from over 3,000 actively monitored sites each year, and combines data from multiple sampling methods to assess trends and inform biodiversity policy.

## Nature of data collected and sampling framework

- Three main components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km), weekly counts (ideally 26 counts per year) across multiple habitat units.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (including essential July/August visits).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts using various methods.
- Data are collected across different sites and contexts but are analyzed together to provide a comprehensive picture of butterfly abundance.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts to reflect population trends.
- Indices are combined using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with weighting that accounts for the extent of the species’ flight period surveyed each year at each site.
- All counts from Pollard walks, WCBS, and reduced surveys are used to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, with higher weight given to observed data over extrapolated data.

## Quality control

- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods); coordinators review flagged records.
- Additional validation includes regional checks by transect coordinators and manual queries to ensure species are within known distributions and flight periods.
- Corrections are made through data queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders.

## Details of this data download

- Provides long- and short-term trends in collated indices for species with sufficient data, as a CSV file.
- Long-term Trends: start year varies by species (1976–2023 where data permit); some species have later start years due to limited early data.
- Key columns and metrics (described in the metadata):
  - COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS
  - F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDDETAIL, F_FULL_R
  - T20_LIN_B, T20_LIN_SE, T20_LIN_P, T20_TRENDDETAIL, T20_20_R
  - T10_LIN_B, T10_LIN_SE, T10_LIN_P, T10_TRENDDETAIL, T10_10_R
- Descriptions indicate whether trends are rapid declines, rapid increases, or stable, based on slope direction and significance.
