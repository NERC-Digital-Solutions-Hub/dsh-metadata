# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - Coordinated and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
  - Relies on volunteer contributions; operational since 1976.
  - Provides annual population status data for butterflies across the UK.
  - Sampling includes: fixed-route standard transects (Pollard walks), stratified-random 1 km square transects (WCBS), and targeted surveys.
  - Currently involves over 3,000 actively recorded sites per year; data from all sampling methods are analyzed together.

- Nature of data collected and trend analysis
  - Data are used to create abundance indices (relative measures of population size, not absolute counts).
  - Indices reflect a stable proportion of true abundance, with some species more detectable than others.
  - Trends are estimated using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) (2016) with weighting that accounts for the flight period surveyed at each site/year.
  - Seasonal counts from all methods are used to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, with observed data given greater weight.

- What data collection entails
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): 2–4 km routes, 5 m wide band, weekly counts (ideally 26 per year) from April to September; typically 45 minutes to 2 hours per site.
  - WCBS: two parallel 1 km transects in stratified-random 1 km squares; 2–3 visits per year (plus encouraged spring visits).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts, and other methods focused on specific species.
  - By 2022, over 2,000 standard transect sites monitored annually; WCBS ~800 squares per year.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online via UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
  - Automatic validation checks during entry; regional transect coordinators review data.
  - Additional automated/manual validations for out-of-range records, unusual flight periods, first-time site records, and extreme values.
  - Data edits performed after consultations with coordinators or recorders to ensure dataset integrity.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides long- and short-term trends for species with sufficient data.
  - Output format: CSV containing trend metrics.
  - Time coverage: long-term trends from 1976 to 2023 (start year may vary per species due to data availability).
  - Key columns (examples):
    - COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS
