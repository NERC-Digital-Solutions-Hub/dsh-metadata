# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with thanks to volunteers who contribute data. It provides annual data on butterfly population status from site-based monitoring, supporting understanding of insect population changes and policy-related biodiversity questions. Since 1976, it has monitored changes across the UK with data from over 3000 active sites annually. All sampling methods are analyzed together.

- Sampling framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 26 counts per year from April to September, recording all species within a fixed width band (about 5 m). Increasingly large coverage, with over 2000 sites by 2022.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August); around 800 squares sampled annually to better cover common habitats like farmland.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval webs) focused on specific species or life stages.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Data are abundance indices (relative measures, not absolute population counts). Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present, with variation by species detectability.
  - Trends are generated using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting that accounts for the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site/year to emphasize observed data over extrapolated data.
  - All counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS are used to model seasonal patterns and produce collated indices for each species.

- Quality control
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms, entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker, and uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks identify potential data errors (e.g., unusually high counts or records outside known flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate records; ongoing checks occur throughout the season.
  - Additional automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range distributions, atypical flight periods, first-time site records, and unusual abundances. Corrections are applied through queries and coordination with recorders as needed.
