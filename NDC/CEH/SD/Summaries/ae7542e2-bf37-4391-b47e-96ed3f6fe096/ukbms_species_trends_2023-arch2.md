# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - Organised and funded by Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.
  - Since 1976, monitors butterfly population status across the UK to inform biodiversity status and policy questions.
  - Relies on a large network of volunteers; currently >3,000 actively recorded sites annually.
  - Data are designed to be used for monitoring, trend analysis, and policy evaluation.

- Data collection methods
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes (2–4 km), count all butterflies in a 5 m band, weekly from April to September (up to 26 counts/year); >2,000 sites worldwide by 2022.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year (plus July/August emphasis); sampling ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts using alternative methods.

- Data nature and trend analysis
  - Abundance indices are relative measures, reflecting a constant proportion of the population at each site.
  - Collated species indices produced with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016), weighted by the proportion of the species flight period surveyed each year at each site.
  - All counts across methods are used to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate counts to account for gaps; observed data are given greater weight.

- Quality control and data handling
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online via UKBMS site or Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automatic checks identify potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate records; further automated/manual validation checks for distribution range, flight period, first-time site records, and anomalous abundances.
  - Data edits are made following queries and coordination with recorders/coordinators.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides long- and short-term trends for species with sufficient data.
  - Data delivered as a CSV file.
  - Long-term series span from 1976 to 2023 (start year may vary by species due to data availability).
  - Columns include common and scientific names, years of series, slopes, standard errors, P-values, trend descriptions, and percentage changes (e.g., F_LIN_B, F_LIN_P, T10/T20 trends).
