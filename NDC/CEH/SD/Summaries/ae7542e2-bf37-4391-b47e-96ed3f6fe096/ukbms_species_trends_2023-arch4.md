# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - A collaborative, volunteer-driven program led by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
  - Informs status and trends in biodiversity; active monitoring since 1976 with over 3,000 sites recorded annually.
  - Data are used to understand butterfly population changes and support policy questions.

- Nature of data collected and sampling framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes (2–4 km), weekly counts (up to 26 counts/year) from April to September; sites selected by recorders.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits per year (plus encouraged spring visits).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species.
  - Data are collected from all methods and combined for analysis.

- Data processing and trend analysis
  - Abundance indices are relative measures of population size, not absolute counts.
  - Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) used to combine site indices into species-level trends; data from all methods are weighted by the proportion of each species’ flight period surveyed each year.
  - Seasonal patterns are estimated using all counts to account for gaps; extrapolation is weighted to emphasize observed data.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag potential errors; regional transect coordinators review data throughout the season.
  - Additional validation for records outside known distribution, out of flight period, first-time site records, or unusual abundances; necessary edits are made to the main dataset.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides long- and short-term trends for species with sufficient data; available as a CSV.
  - Long-term trends cover 1976–2023 (start year may vary per species due to data availability).
  - Key columns include: COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS, F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDDETAIL, F_FULL_R, T20_LIN_B, T20_LIN_SE, T20_LIN_P, T20_TRENDDETAIL, T20_20_R, T10_LIN_B, T10_LIN_SE, T10_LIN_P, T10_TRENDDETAIL, T10_10_R, plus metadata details.
