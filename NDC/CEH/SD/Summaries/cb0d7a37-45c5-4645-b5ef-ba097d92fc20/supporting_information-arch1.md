# Growth rates of grass species with contrasting photosynthetic pathways and life histories

- Open Government Licence (OGL) data access and licensing: dataset available under OGL; citation required as Wade et al. (2020) in New Phytologist; DOI provided.

- Brief description of contents:
  - Sequential biomass harvests from a plant growth experiment in Sheffield under controlled conditions.
  - Three experimental parts conducted in 2016–2017 to compare growth among grasses with C3 vs C4 photosynthesis and annual vs perennial life histories.
  - Weekly harvests over five weeks for measurements of dry biomass of roots and leaves, and counts of roots, leaves, and shoot branches.
  - Independent leaf anatomy dataset from herbarium specimens used to test how mechanical support scales with leaf size.
  - Includes phylogenetic relationships among species for analyses.
  - Funded by NERC (NE/N003152/1); relates to Wade et al. (2020) in New Phytologist.

- Experimental design and sampling regime:
  - Phylogenetic comparative analysis of 74 grass species grown in controlled environments.
  - Stratified sampling across BOP (C3) and PACMAD lineages; includes 12 independent C4 lineages and 20 annual grass groups, with multiple annual vs perennial pairs per lineage.
  - Short-lived perennials (<3 years) coded as annuals for this study.
  - Seeds sourced from public germplasm collections; random draws within lineages to maximize diversity of C4/C3 and annual/perennial combinations.

- Seed preparation, germination, and transplanting:
  - Pre-germination treatments based on preliminary tests and Kew guidance.
  - Germination in Petri dishes (20 seeds per dish); transplant 20 seedlings per species to 2 L pots with vermiculite and topped with wet sand.
  - ~10% early mortality; 30% seedling replacement possible.

- Growth conditions:
  - Plants placed in controlled environment chambers in a randomized block design (eight trolleys per chamber).
  - 14 h daylength; 30/25°C day/night; ~80% humidity.
  - Light intensity averaged around 1056 ± 88.3 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ PPFD at pot height.
  - Automated watering (deionised water) and nutrient supply (50% Long Ashton nitrate-type solution) twice weekly.

- Data collection and measurements:
  - Three staggered experiments with recorded germination dates.
  - Pre-transplant: non-destructive measurements on 10 germinated seedlings per species; daily counts of root tips and leaves before transplant.
  - Post-transplant: periodic counts of leaves, leaves on the main tiller, tillers; weekly main stem height.
  - Harvests: four plants per species per time point harvested weekly for five weeks; roots washed; biomass separated into leaves, stems, and roots; fresh mass recorded; leaves counted and detached at ligule.
  - Image-based measurements: root architecture (total length, surface area, average diameter, forks, tips) via WinRHIZO; leaf area via WinDIAS; primary roots counted from embryo images.
  - Dry biomass: half of replicate plants dried at 70°C and weighed; secondary roots computed as total root tips minus primary roots.
  - Additional structural analysis: study of tissues for mechanical support (veins, fibres) using transverse leaf sections from 86 species; per-vein tissue areas scaled to whole-leaf values using vein counts.

- Leaf structural data and analysis:
  - Tissue investments quantified per segment for veins, epidermis, bundle sheath, fibres, mesophyll, etc.
  - Total vein area and related tissues normalized by leaf vein count; scaled to whole leaves using total vein number.

- Phylogenetic and analytical methods:
  - Phylogeny reconstruction using four chloroplast regions (trnK-matK, rbcL, ndhF, trnL-trnF); sequences from NCBI or generated by Sanger sequencing.
  - Alignment with MUSCLE; concatenated data; time-calibrated tree with BEAST 1.8.4; model GTR+G+I; Yule speciation prior; relaxed clock with lognormal distribution.
  - Monophyly of BOP and PACMAD enforced; divergence constrained by prior; two runs of 10,000,000 generations; convergence checked with Tracer; burn-in 5,000,000.
  - Cross-section phylogeny taken from Christin et al. (2013) for LEAF_SUPPORT analyses.

- Datasets and file formats:

  - GROWTH_ANALYSIS_DATASET.CSV: growth measurements per plant, including dates, leaf counts, shoot length, tillers, root metrics, biomass, leaf area, SLA, yields, and derived plant-level metrics; includes life history, photosynthetic pathway, and lineage.
  - LEAF_SUPPORT_DATASET.CSV: leaf structural data per species, including life history, photosynthetic pathway, vein counts, leaf width, and per-segment tissue areas for epidermis, fibres, mesophyll, vascular tissue, bundle sheath extensions, etc.
  - Phylogenies: concatenated_combined.tre for growth analysis; gpwg4.tre for LEAF_SUPPORT analyses.

- Usage and potential analyses:
  - Explore correlations between photosynthetic pathway, life history, and growth rate across diverse lineages in a controlled setting.
  - Assess relationships between biomass allocation (leaf vs root), root architecture, and leaf anatomical traits in a phylogenetic context.
  - Develop predictive models of growth dynamics incorporating leaf structural investments and phlyogenetic relatedness.
  - Compare structural constraints on leaf size (vein/fibre investment) with observed growth rates across C3/C4 and annual/perennial grasses.
