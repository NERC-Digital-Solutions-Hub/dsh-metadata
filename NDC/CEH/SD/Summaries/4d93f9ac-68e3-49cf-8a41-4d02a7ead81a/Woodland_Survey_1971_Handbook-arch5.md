# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HAND BOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope: A structured field method for surveying woodlands to classify and describe sites, habitats, flora, trees, soils, and related features. Designed for large-scale surveys (1648 plots) with standardized data collection to ensure consistency and usability of datasets.

- Data governance alignment: Emphasizes standardized procedures, explicit metadata (site and plot identifiers, recorder initials, dates), controlled data capture forms, and documentation of work for traceability and reuse across users and datasets.

## Data governance and management considerations for data stewards

- Standardization: Fixed forms (Site Description and Habitat Form; Plot Description and Habitat Form) with defined attribute codes to ensure uniform data entry and interoperability.

- Provenance and traceability: Each site and plot has unique identifiers (Site No., Plot No.), recorder initials, date, slope, aspect, and other context to enable data lineage and audit trails.

- Metadata and coding: Use of code numbers for attributes, presence/absence data, and office-use codes (e.g., Code No for species identification) to support data punching, quality checks, and downstream analyses.

- Data quality and bias control: Procedures emphasize minimizing subjective bias in locating sampling points (predetermined mechanical locating method) and ensuring unbiased sampling across plots.

- Updateability and sharing: Data are organized by site and plot, with clear procedures for completion, packaging, and submission; emphasis on documenting methods to facilitate sharing and re-use.

- Common data challenges: Timeliness of data submission, getting data creators to meet standards, interoperability across diverse systems, handling large datasets, and dealing with outdated or bespoke data formats.

## Planning, permissions, and access

- Pre-survey planning: Prepare a site survey outline to minimize travel; consider surveying multiple sites from a shared base when feasible.

- Permissions: Obtain entry permissions; the Regional Office or Merlewood may grant exemptions or require direct contact with landowners. Emphasizes public relations and explaining that surveys are not purchases, though conservation value may be identified.

- Access logistics: Determine optimal entry points to minimize walking distance; use marked tracks and avoid trespassing on fields or fences; if permission is refused, use alternative backup sites.

## Sampling design and locating sampling points

- Site information: Advance information about sites provided; 22" site maps used for locating points.

- Sampling framework: Each site contains 16 randomly located sampling points marked on the map.

- Accuracy and bias control: Aim to place ground-truth sampling points within a 20 m radius of the mapped location; steps include selecting a control point, orienting the map and compass, and pacing out distances with predetermined steps, while avoiding subjective bias.

- Ground truthing process: Ground control point to sample point bearing adjusted for magnetic variation; use of scale on compass; pace counting and slope adjustments if needed; adherence to predetermined distances to minimize deviation.

## Order of data collection and data sheets

- Recording sequence: Data collected from each sampling point in this order (order can be adjusted as convenient):
  - Ground flora presence/absence across five progressively larger quadrats (up to 14.14 x 14.14 m), including % cover/abundance estimates for the largest quadrat.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: diameter (cm) and height, in specified plot quarters; dead trees or stumps documented; largest tree height recorded.
  - Plot description and habitat data: presence/absence of habitat attributes; slope and aspect measured; ground profile sketch.
  - Soil data: small pit and auger borings in the plot center; composite top 10-15 cm sample; horizon-based soil description (Ao to C) with depth, moisture, color, texture, structure, and other horizon attributes.
- Plot layout: Center point marked; four corner posts delineate 2x2 m to 14.14x14.14 m plots; markers indicate half-diagonal distances for subplots.

## Data capture by domain

- Ground flora
  - Record presence/absence for all vascular plants (monocots, dicots, ferns) across expanding quadrats (2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m).
  - Collect specimens for herbarium (Appendix I) for unidentified or rare species; label and store appropriately.
  - Bryophytes: collect a comprehensive vascular plant set; not recorded as bryophytes within the 2x2 m quadrats, but bryophytes on soil and ground flora are noted via herbarium sampling.

- Trees, saplings, and shrubs
  - Trees: stems >5 cm DBH, with species and DBH measured per quarter; dead components recorded with a “D.”
  - Saplings: height >1 m and <5 cm DBH recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); same data collection as trees.
  - Shrubs: recorded similarly to saplings; measured data use same conventions.
  - Maximum tree height recorded with a height instrument.

- Plot descriptor and habitats
  - Record slope (degrees) and aspect; provide a detailed site sketch of topography along the measured line.
  - Complete a habitat attribute checklist; use Appendix IV definitions; include notes on parts of larger habitat units (e.g., glades) that occur within the plot.

- Soil data and soil description
  - Small pit (top 25–30 cm) plus auger borings in the center; composite 10–15 cm sample.
  - Horizons recorded and interpreted: Ao, A0, Ai, Al, A2, B1, B2, C, plus underlying material; horizon depths are recorded using from-to depths (not just thickness).
  - Measurements include pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay), moisture, color, structure, and presence of organic/inorganic layers.
  - Horizon interpretation details provided (see Appendix on soil interpretation); practical horizon coding (A, B, C) with notes on mottling, gleying, and horizon transitions.
  - If insufficient soil sample, note adjustments and potential substitutes in the form.

## Site description and habitat forms

- Site Description and Habitat Form
  - A full description of the site, including habitat types and marginal land use, is completed for each site.
  - A separate Plot Description and Habitat Form is completed for each site plot, with a condensed attribute scheme aligned to site attributes for data handling.
  - Ensures consistency between plot- and site-level data while accommodating differences in attribute coding.

- Data integrity and consistency
  - Check that site and plot data align logically; ensure all attributes present on the site form appear on the plot form where required.
  - If any part of the site was not fully covered, conduct a quick check or brief visit to ensure no attributes were missed.

## Herbarium specimens and species identification

- Herbarium collection guidelines
  - Obtain a type specimen for all species observed; include flowering shoots when possible.
  - Record correct scientific names and codes used in field sheets; attach specimens securely to herbarium sheets.
  - When uncertain, collect a specimen and class it provisionally in the herbarium to enable later confirmation.

## Soil data interpretation and major woodland soil types

- Soil science framework
  - Emphasizes limited but informative soil measurements (pH, LOI, mechanical analysis) to support a numerical soil description aligned with broader classification.
  - Highlights major woodland soil types in Britain:
    - Podzolic soils (acid, leached, often podzolized) and podzols; transition to hydromorphic soils where drainage is impeded.
    - Calcareous soils associated with free calcium carbonate (chalk/limestone) with Varied horizons (Rendzina, redder soils, Terra Rossa in some contexts).
  - Horizon interpretation uses a horizon-by-horizon approach (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) with criteria for color, texture, structure, moisture, and horizon transitions.

- Horizon coding and interpretation
  - Ao, Ai, Al, A2: organic/mineral transitions; leaching and eluviation indicators.
  - B1/B2: deposition and weathering processes; oxide deposition and humus accumulation.
  - C: underlying material; horizon depth and thickness noted when ascertainable.
  - Underlying material and rocks within soil: mineral fragments, rock fragments, and depth limitations documented.

## Data packaging, equipment, and submission

- Site-based packaging
  - Four site data sheets per site; soil samples packed in three boxes; bryophyte and field sheets in another box.
  - Boxes sealed, labeled, and posted to designated address; aim for timely submission and clean organization to facilitate downstream processing.

- Equipment and field logistics
  - Field equipment list includes sampling poles, compass, tapes, quadrat layout kit, soil tools (mattock, auger), and herbarium materials.
  - Emphasizes careful packing to prevent loss and ensure traceability of samples and data.

## Appendices and instructions
