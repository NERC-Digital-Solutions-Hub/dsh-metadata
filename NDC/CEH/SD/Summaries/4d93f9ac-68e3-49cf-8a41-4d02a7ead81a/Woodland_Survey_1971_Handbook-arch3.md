# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

## Purpose and scope
- Provides a standardized, field-based methodology for surveying and classifying woodlands to inform policy scrutiny, monitoring of environmental health, and future decision-making.
- Targets managers in government departments or environmental quangos responsible for designing and implementing monitoring approaches.

## Data types and indicators
- Ground flora: presence/absence and cover of vascular plants and bryophytes across multiple quadrat sizes.
- Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, diameter at breast height (DBH), heights, and regeneration data; categorization by size class and life stage; dead trees recorded distinctly.
- Plot descriptors and habitats: slope, aspect, habitat attributes, and detailed site description capturing major habitat components.
- Soil data: limited, standardized soil properties (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical composition) plus horizon-level descriptions (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, underlying material) and rudimentary interpretation.
- Site-level descriptors: site description and habitats form to capture broader site characteristics and marginal land use.
- Biota and features: epiphytes, lichens, bryophytes, fungi, invertebrates, birds, mammals, and evidence of animal use or presence, recorded on plot/site forms.
- Management and historical context: signs of planting, coppicing, stumps, pollards, brash, timber extraction routes, and other management indicators.
- Boundary, marginal land use, and human influences: hedges, banks, ditches, fences, roads, railway lines, and other features distally affecting woodland.

## Survey design, access, and logistics
- Permission to survey: obtain owner/land access; use tact and public-relations emphasis to reassure owners that surveys are for conservation, not purchase.
- Backup sites: if permission is refused, use alternative back-up sites from Merlewood.
- Site access planning: minimize travel, choose efficient bases, and use marked tracks/footpaths to reduce disturbance and improve efficiency.
- Stakeholder engagement: provide owners with a brief description of the survey and address questions; maintain good relations as a key facet of Conservancy work.
- Data governance context: outputs are meant to be shared and standardized; emphasis on transparent metadata and consistent recording.

## Locating sampling points and accuracy
- Sampling framework: 22" map with 16 random sampling points per site; points located to within about 20 meters of the true location.
- Ground-truthing process: identify a control point on a map (intersection, fence, landmark), orient with map/compass, then pace out to the sampling point; adjust for slope as needed.
- Bias avoidance: prioritize predetermined, mechanical locating characteristics to minimize subjective bias.
- Efficiency and safety: use authorized access points; avoid trespass or unnecessary disturbance.

## Order of data collection and recording
- Data collection sequence (per site, per plot):
  - (a) Ground flora (first, to minimize disturbance from trampling)
  - (b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs
  - (c) Plot description and habitats
  - (d) Soil data (center of plot)
- Additionally, collect composite soil sample (top 10–15 cm) and two soil samples per plot; complete site-level habitat description form after plot data.
- Completion checks: verify forms are complete, samples logged, equipment accounted for, and site identified correctly.

## Ground flora: sampling methodology
- Quadrat layout: start with 2 x 2 m plots, then delineate 14.14 x 14.14 m or 14 x 14 m plots; use center and corner stakes to define plotting boundaries.
- Recording: in each quadrat size, record all ground flora (vascular plants, including seedlings) and collect bryophyte samples for herbarium reference.
- Data capture: list species (codes allowed), estimate percent cover or abundance for the largest quadrat, and provide an overall 100-strikes cover estimate for the full plot.
- Bryophytes: comprehensive collection of bryophytes on soil and habitat features; tree bases and substrates are noted but bryophytes on tree bases are not fully enumerated in bryophyte tallies.
- Specimens: collect representative herbarium specimens for any uncertain identifications; attach to herbarium sheets with labels.

## Trees, saplings, and shrubs: measurement and recording
- Trees (>5 cm DBH): record species, DBH, and height; count stems for multi-stemmed individuals; note dead or dying status with a D indicator.
- Saplings (<5 cm DBH): recorded in diagonally opposite plot quarters (1 and 3) with same data as trees.
- Shrubs: also recorded in diagonally opposite quarters; same data convention as saplings.
- Height: measure the tallest tree in the plot with a height instrument (e.g., hypsometer).
- Final recording: an example form is provided to illustrate completed data entries.

## Plot descriptor and habitats
- Attributes: presence/absence of defined habitat features; detailed definitions provided in an appendix.
- Slope and aspect: recorded; slope via instrument-specific methods; aspect indicates the compass bearing of the maximum slope.
- Ground profile: sketch of the slope along the maximum line, including major features (cliffs, rocks, streams, etc.).
- Interpreting and recording soil and habitat: use standardized codes for attributes; notes and sketches supplement the data.

## Site description and soil data: interpretation and horizons
- Soil approach: limited, standardized soil data to enable numerical description and cross-site comparison.
- Major woodland soil types: Podzols (acid, highly leached) with potential transitions to hydromorphic (gley) or skeletal soils; calcareous soils on base-rich rocks common in chalk/limestone regions; soils are typically immature and dynamic.
- Field methods: use a small pit and auger to sample the upper 25–30 cm and down to approximately 70 cm depth; collect composite samples from top 10–15 cm for analysis.
- Horizon descriptions: Ao, A1, A2, B1, B2, and underlying material; record horizon depth (from-to) and a concise interpretation of pedological processes.
- Soil properties to measure in the field: pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) with scale-friendly descriptors; additional samples retained for future analyses.
- Horizon attributes: color, texture, structure, moisture, and presence of features such as mottling and gleying; interpret horizon transitions and weathering processes.
- Documentation: fill horizon-specific attributes on standardized forms; attach notes for complex or disturbed profiles; include depth, horizon type, and any constraints due to auger depth.

## Completion of the site and data handling
- Site closure: bundle four data sheets per site, two soil samples per plot, then seal and label parcels for postage; ship in pre-paid, pre-addressed boxes.
- Data integrity: ensure no omissions; verify site and plot numbers; back-trace to field sheets and labels; maintain organized field equipment logs.
- Documentation: a Site Description and Habitats form accompanies plot data; forms are designed for consistent data handling and later aggregation.

## Forms and coding framework
- Site Description and Habitats form and Plot Description and Habitats form: parallel, with sequential attribute codes; cross-checks ensure consistency between site and plot data.
- Codes: fields include site/plot numbers, recorder initials, date, slope, aspect, and various habitat/biota attributes; a separate “unallocated” category handles missing or future-allocated codes.

## Habitat and management categories
- Management indicators: planted hardwoods, coppiced or pollarded trees, brash, stumps, timber extraction routes, and sign of past management practices.
- Marginal land use and boundary types: documented to understand landscape context and edge effects on woodland health.

## Equipment and field organisation
- Field equipment kit is specified, including plotting apparatus (center pole, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings), compasses, tapes, notebooks, herbarium materials, augers, mattocks, and sampling bags.
- Operational guidance emphasizes efficiency, safety, and organization to support repeatable monitoring across sites.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- The handbook delivers a thorough, standardized data collection and governance structure aligned with robust monitoring needs:
  - Standardized indicators (biodiversity, regeneration, habitat types, soil condition) across sites for policy evaluation.
  - Clear procedures for data quality, metadata, and audit trails (forms, codes, herbarium vouchers).
  - Data sharing and public accessibility considerations, with explicit data provenance and sample storage.
  - A governance-ready workflow: permissions, site planning, data capture, form-based data entry, specimen collection, and post-field processing.
