# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - Establishes standardized field methods for surveying and classifying woodlands to demonstrate environmental condition and policy performance over time.
  - Targets organisations with fixed monitoring responsibilities, combining topic expertise with analytical, standardized approaches.
  - Emphasizes verifiable data from established sources, clear outputs (reports, maps, charts), and storage/upload of datasets to appropriate portals.

- Planning, permissions, and logistics
  - Prepare a site survey plan to minimise travel and accommodate access constraints; survey from a base when possible.
  - Obtain permission to enter and survey each site; use tact and public relations to address owners’ concerns about privacy, game, fences, or perceived interference.
  - If permission is denied, rely on backup sites and inform Merlewood to supply necessary survey information (maps, sampling points).
  - Receive a complete field equipment set and maps before departure; follow the equipment checklist for site work.

- Sampling design and point location
  - Each site includes up to 16 sampling points marked on a 22" map, aiming for ground-truth location within a 20 m radius.
  - Locate points with two critical goals: accuracy and absence of subjective bias. Use control points (intersections, walls, streams) and predetermined bearings (adjusted for magnetic variation) to pace out distances.
  - Ground-truthing rules emphasize consistency: follow predetermined pace counts, use fixed directions, and avoid unnecessary detours (e.g., across fences or private fences).

- Plot layout and data collection sequence
  - Establish a central point with a right-angle gauge to randomise plot orientation; extend distance strings to four corner posts to delineate nested plot sizes (2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m or 200 m2).
  - Data collection order to minimise disturbance: ground flora first, then trees saplings and shrubs, then soil data; plot description and habitat data can be gathered concurrently or subsequently.
  - Record-keeping involves multiple data sheets per site and per plot, with careful cross-referencing of site, plot, and recorder details.

- Ground flora (per plot)
  - Use a spiral outward search from the centre to record presence/absence of all vascular plant species across four quadrat sizes: 2x2 m (4 m2) up to 14.14x14.14 m (200 m2).
  - For each quadrat size, list species (or codes) and assess % cover/abundance for the largest quadrat; collect bryophyte samples comprehensively for herbarium (bryophytes not fully enumerated in the smallest quadrat).
  - Collect herbarium specimens for unidentified or rare species; label with field IDs and codes; maintain a complete herbarium for accuracy.

- Trees, saplings, and shrubs
  - Measure trees (>5 cm DBH) in the full plot; record species, diameter, and status (living, dead, stump). For saplings and shrubs, record in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) with height/diameter data.
  - Identify dead materials (standing or fallen) and mark with codes; determine the tallest tree in the plot and measure height with a specialized instrument.
  - Use standardized conventions for multi-stemmed trees and coppice indicators to infer woodland history (e.g., coppice stools, recently cut coppice).

- Plot description and habitats
  - Record plot-level habitat attributes (slope, aspect, presence of glades, water features, soil surface attributes, etc.) using a defined attribute list with accompanying definitions in Appendix IV.
  - Create a sketch of ground profile along the line of maximum slope to accompany the descriptive habitat data.
  - Include a comments field for interpretation notes not covered by standard codes.

- Soil data and interpretation
  - Collect soil samples from the plot center via a small pit (to about 25–30 cm) and auger cores; obtain a composite sample from the top 10–15 cm.
  - Measure limited physical/chemical properties in the field: pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) using a simplified approach; preserve sub-samples for potential later analyses.
  - Use a numerical soil description approach to classify major woodland soil types (Podzolic, Brown Earths, Calcareous, Hydromorphic, Skeletal) and horizons (A0/A1/A2, B1/B2, C), with horizons described by depth, color, texture, structure, moisture, and presence of humus or oxides.
  - Document horizon boundaries with depth from/to values and assign horizon-specific attributes (A0/A1/A2, B1/B2, C) as applicable; note transitions, wetness, gleying, and underlying material when relevant.
  - If the auger cannot reach full depth (e.g., <70 cm), record depth limitations on the form; ensure that the soil description remains consistent with the horizon interpretation.

- Site description and habitats (site-wide)
  - Complete a Site Description and Habitats form for the entire site, separate from Plot Description forms, to capture in-between plots and boundary features.
  - Record marginal land use and boundary types (e.g., hedges, walls, fences, banks, ditches) using standardized codes; walk the boundary as needed to document habitat context.

- Data quality, coding, and management
  - Use standardized codes for each attribute to enable uniform data punching and integration into a centralized dataset.
  - For site and plot forms, maintain consistent coding sequences and cross-check for logical consistency (e.g., if an attribute is present on the site form, ensure it is represented in the corresponding plot form as appropriate).
  - Prepare and store data sheets as part of a site package (including 4 plot sheets and 2 soil samples per plot; 16 plots per site) for posting or handover to the data portal.

- Taxonomic and herbarium protocol
  - Submit a herbarium collection demonstrating accuracy of species records, acquiring type specimens when possible; label specimens with field IDs and formal names; attach to herbarium sheets securely.
  - If identifications are uncertain, collect a specimen to verify later; consolidate duplicates with the herbarium to maintain data integrity.

- Site completion and transportation
  - After completing all data sheets and collecting samples, verify that all required sheets are completed and correctly labeled; pack soil and bryophyte samples into specified boxes with labels and shipping stickers.
  - Use pre-paid, pre-addressed parcels to dispatch samples promptly; manage field logistics to prevent clutter and maintain sample freshness.

- Appendices and forms
  - Appendices provide instructions for herbarium collection, examples of completed ground flora and tree/sapling forms, site and plot description forms, soil data collection instructions, and equipment checklists.
  - Include detailed instructions for completing soil profiles, horizon interpretation, and attribute definitions to support consistent data entry and interpretation.

- Field equipment and logistics
  - A comprehensive list of field equipment is provided (plot marking gear, compasses, tapes, calipers, mattock, auger, sample bags, labels, stapler, map, etc.) to standardize field operations and ensure consistent data collection across surveys.

- Outputs for environmental monitoring
  - The handbook supports the generation of comparable, time-series data to assess woodland condition, biodiversity attributes, habitat types, soil conditions, and management impacts.
  - Data are intended to be integrated into a broader monitoring framework and made accessible for scrutiny and policy evaluation.
