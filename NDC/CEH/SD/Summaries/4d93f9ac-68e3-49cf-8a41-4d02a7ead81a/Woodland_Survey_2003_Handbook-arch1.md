Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Field handbook for the National Woodland Survey 2002, adapted from the 1971 GB baseline survey.
  - Provides standardized methods for collecting data to describe woodland indicators, with a focus on ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot descriptors, site habitats, soil samples, and site-level context.
  - Produced by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) Merlewood; includes appendices with data forms, equipment, and laboratory protocols.

- Survey design and sampling framework
  - Each site comprises 16 random sampling points; output datasets are collected from 16 plots per site.
  - Location materials include a 1:50,000 map, a 2½" original map, and an enlarged plot-location map to locate the 16 plots.
  - Location accuracy and lack of subjective bias are stressed; GPS is discouraged because it may bias relocation relative to 1971 plot locations.
  - Permits and owner permissions are mandatory; a letter of introduction and owner contact details are provided to facilitate access.
  - A relocation approach uses pacing with compass bearings, derived distances/angles from plot-location maps; sites may have changed (buildings, motorways) and such changes should be noted.

- Data collection framework and order
  - Four recording datasets per site per plot, plus one soil sample per plot:
    - Vegetation plot: Ground flora
    - Site description and habitats
    - Trees, saplings and shrubs
    - Plot description and habitat data
  - An additional site-wide data form captures broader context and habitats between plots.
  - Data capture is designed to be comprehensive, with attention to consistency between site and plot forms.

- Recording and data forms
  - Recording forms are designed to minimize bias and ensure replicability; forms use sequential attribute codes and must be checked for consistency across site and plot levels.
  - Recommendations emphasize using clutch pencils, waterproof forms, and recording the plot’s vegetation first (to minimize disturbance).

- Vegetation plot: ground flora (2.1)
  - A central 14.14 x 14.14 m plot is subdivided into nested quadrats (five sizes, from 2 x 2 m up to the full plot).
  - For each quadrat, presence/absence of vascular plants is recorded; bryophytes on soil are recorded (major, not exhaustive).
  - After all quadrats, an estimate of total cover for the full plot is recorded (percent to the nearest 5%), including litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water, and bryophytes.
  - Canopy cover is not included; ground flora is the focus.

- Trees, saplings and shrubs (2.2)
  - Measurements use the same 14.14 x 14.14 m plot.
  - Trees: stems >5 cm DBH; species and DBH recorded for the whole plot, with multi-stemmed trees recorded per stem; dead trees indicated.
  - Saplings: height >130 cm but <5 cm DBH; recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 NE, 3 SW).
  - Shrubs: recorded in the same diagonally opposite quarters as saplings.
  - Height measurements: the largest tree height is recorded using a clinometer, hypsometer, or other calibrated method; horizontal distance is measured along the same contour; if atypical, substitute the next largest tree.
  - Height calculation examples provided for clinometer-based measurements.

- Plot description and habitats (2.3)
  - Presence/absence data for a broad set of habitat attributes within the plot (14.14 x 14.14 m).
  - Some attributes cover larger areas; if part of a defined area lies within the plot, it is recorded as present.
  - Comments field allows recording of relevant information not captured elsewhere.

- Soil sampling (2.4)
  - One composite soil sample per plot, taken from the center (within 1 m if necessary).
  - Top 15 cm sampled; clear labeling (site and plot) on bags; double labeling recommended.
  - Standardized procedures for removing litter/rocks, collecting a representative sample, and handling/return to CEH Merlewood.
  - Problems or deviations recorded on the form; samples stored in site-specific boxes and kept cool until shipment.

- Completion and data handling (2.5, 3.1)
  - After data collection, check for completeness, confirm site/plot codes, and ensure all samples and equipment are accounted for.
  - A separate site-description form accompanies the plot data.
  - All sheets are bound into site folders for data entry.

- Site-level data, attributes, and data dictionary (General; Appendix IV)
  - The Site Description and Habitat Form covers the whole site; Plot Description and Habitat Form covers each 16 plots per site.
  - Attribute codes are organized in sections (A–N) to support consistent data capture and interpretation.
  - Sections include: Trees – Management (A), Trees – Regeneration (B), Trees – Dead (C), Epiphytes and Lianes (D), Habitats – Rocks (E), Habitats – Aquatic (F), Habitats – Open (G), Habitats – Human (H), Habitats – Vegetation (I), Animals (J), Birds (K), Marginal Land Use (L), Boundary Type (M), Subjective Overall Impression (N), plus a Comments section.
  - Some attributes require field verification across boundaries, open areas, or edges between woodland and surroundings.

- Appendices, data dictionaries, and reference materials
  - Appendix I: List of top common bryophytes from Pilot woodland sites; Appendix Ib: List of common bryophytes in Great Britain.
  - Appendix II: Vegetation Plot data (example form for groundwater plots; includes numerous species entries and percent cover).
  - Appendix III: Tree, sapling and shrub data (example entry for 1971 site; species and measurements).
  - Appendix IV: Site Description and Habitats data structure, with detailed attribute definitions and coding guidance.
  - Appendix V: Field equipment list (per-site survey gear, map materials, labelling tools, etc.).
  - Appendix VI: Soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH determination, loss on ignition LOI, sample preparation, and calculation formulas).

- Equipment and logistics
  - Per-site and per-plot field equipment lists ensure standardized data collection (maps, letters of introduction, plot-marking gear, compasses, DBH tapes, measuring tapes, hand lenses, pencils, waterproof forms, and soil bags).
  - A defined workflow for field logistics, permissions, sample dispatch, and QA/QC is provided to support consistent data collection and timely sample return to CEH Merlewood.

- Data quality, challenges, and considerations for analysts
  - Emphasis on data consistency, standardization, and documentation to enable robust cross-site comparisons and longitudinal analyses.
  - Acknowledges challenges such as data gaps, access restrictions, data located in dispersed sources, and the need to unify data across multiple formats and scales.
  - Practical guidance on maintaining data integrity: careful relocation, avoidance of bias, full documentation of site changes, and meticulous labeling and handling of soil samples.

- Endnotes and intended use
  - The handbook aims to enable robust, repeatable field data collection for woodland indicators, supporting analysis, correlations, and modeling of actions’ likely impacts.
  - It foregrounds the importance of metadata, traceability of data sources, and making datasets discoverable for reuse and verification.
