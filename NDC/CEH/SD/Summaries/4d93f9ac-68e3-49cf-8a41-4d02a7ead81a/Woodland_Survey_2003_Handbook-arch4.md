# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

- An in-depth field handbook for the National Woodland Survey 2002, amended from earlier baseline surveys, detailing methods to collect, record, and manage woodland data across multiple sites and plots.

## Purpose and scope
- Provides standardized methods to update 1971 woodland records (plus new observations) through a structured re-survey.
- Aims to produce comprehensive, comparable datasets on site descriptions, vegetation, soils, and habitats for each woodland site.

## Data collection framework and structure
- Per site: complete collection across 16 plots (arranged within a 1 km square context) plus a site-wide description.
- Per plot: four primary data records and one soil sample from the plot center, using waterproof forms:
  - Vegetation plot: ground flora across five progressively larger quadrats (2 x 2 m up to 14.14 x 14.14 m) with presence/absence and 5%-increment cover estimates for vascular plants, plus major bryophytes on soil.
  - Trees, saplings and shrubs: species, DBH for stems >5 cm, DBH for multi-stemmed individuals, saplings and shrubs in diagonally opposite quarters, height measurements for the largest tree.
  - Plot description and habitat: presence/absence of habitat attributes to derive site-scale context.
  - Site description and habitats: site-wide habitat and land-use context (open, aquatic, marginal land use, boundaries, etc.).
- Soil sampling: one composite soil sample per plot from the top 15 cm; strict labeling and storage protocols to avoid data loss.

## Plot location, relocation, and data integrity
- Plot locations identified with multiple map references (1:50,000 OS extract, original 2½" map) and an enlarged plot map; plots re-recorded with careful relocation to avoid subjective bias.
- GPS discouraged because it may bias relocation relative to original 1971 plot positions; relocation relies on compass bearings, pacing, and map-to-ground scaling.
- Emphasis on accuracy and avoiding bias: no deliberate selection of “typical” spots; document changes in land use or site conditions (e.g., motorway encroachment) and avoid recording in areas without permission.
- Permission to survey must be obtained; landowners are contacted with a letter of introduction and offered copies of results.

## Recording procedures and data management
- Data capture follows a defined order to minimize disturbance and ensure data integrity:
  - Record vegetation ground flora first (to capture an undisturbed state), then proceed with other datasets.
  - Use clutch pencils; write on waterproof forms; ensure site and plot identifiers are consistent across all forms.
  - Ensure data completeness: verify that all required fields are filled and that site/plot codes align between site and plot forms.
- Data structure and coding:
  - Site and plot forms use distinct but compatible attribute codes to facilitate integrated analysis.
  - Field notes and comments sections for contextual information and owner conversations to aid interpretation of change.
- Post-field workflow:
  - Assemble four data sheets per site (and two soil sample sets per 16 plots) plus the site description; staple and return to the site folder for data entry.
  - Soil samples dispatched to CEH Merlewood for analysis within the week when feasible; options for delivery include hand, courier, or post.

## Vegetation and habitat data specifics
- Ground flora (vegetation plot): recording across five quadrats with increasing area; presence/absence for species; complete bryophyte list not required beyond major soil bryophytes; percentage cover estimates for all vascular plants plus litter, wood, bare ground, water, bryophytes; cover estimates rounded to nearest 5%.
- Trees, saplings, and shrubs: definition thresholds for trees (>5 cm DBH), saplings (>130 cm height, <5 cm DBH), and shrubs; measurements by plot quarter; multi-stemmed trees recorded but bracketed in data sheets; height measured using clinometer, hypsometer, or comparable methods; ensure consistent horizontal distance and slope considerations.
- Plot description and habitats: frequency-like presence/absence data for habitat attributes; special attention to areas with defined boundaries, glades, ponds, and other habitat types.
- Site description and habitats: broader site context including marginal land use and boundary types; field sketches encouraged.

## Data quality challenges and considerations
- Key challenges include understanding diverse user needs (e.g., policy colleagues), ensuring data availability and granularity, and maintaining data standards and metadata quality.
- Potential relocation bias and accuracy issues due to non-permanent plot markers; GPS use is discouraged to prevent mapping bias.
- Changes in land use since 1971 (e.g., roads, railways) require careful note-taking and may affect plot recording decisions.

## Appendices, data standards, and tools
- Appendix IV and related forms provide detailed attribute definitions and coding for site and plot data; supports consistent data capture and cross-site comparability.
- Appendix II and Appendix III illustrate example data structures for vegetation plots and tree data, including standard fields for species, height, DBH, and plot-specific attributes.
- Appendix Ia/Ib list common bryophytes encountered, emphasizing data ordering and species cataloging within woodland surveys.
- Appendix V lists field equipment and per-site deliverables required for field teams (maps, permissions, plot marking equipment, soil bags, labels, etc.).
- Appendix VI outlines soil laboratory protocols (pH measurement, loss on ignition, sample preparation) for consistency in soil analyses.

## Soil analysis protocols (Appendix VI)
- Soil samples (approx. 2 kg) shipped to CEH Merlewood, processed with sieving (2 mm), pH measurements (fresh and after extraction), and LOI (loss on ignition) procedures.
- Standardized steps for preparing, drying, ashing, and calculating dry matter percentages to support soil chemistry and organic matter assessments.

## Equipment and per-site deliverables
- Comprehensive list of field gear, labeling materials, and per-site data collection kits (16 vegetation forms, 16 tree/sapling/shrub forms, 16 plot description sheets, and 1 site description sheet per site).
- Emphasis on consistent tools (map references, compasses, sighting poles, DBH tapes, plotting strings) to ensure reproducibility and data discoverability across sites and over time.

- Overall, the Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey provides a rigorous, standardized workflow for collecting, recording, and managing woodland data to support long-term monitoring, comparability across sites, and effective data-driven woodland management decisions.
