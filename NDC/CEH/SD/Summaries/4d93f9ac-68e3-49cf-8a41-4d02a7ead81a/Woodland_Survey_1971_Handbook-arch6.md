# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose: provide a standardized, field-based protocol for surveying woodlands to classify habitats, document flora and woody components, and describe soils, site features, and management context. Data are intended for mapping, policy support, and conservation planning.

- Scope of data: site-level and plot-level descriptions, ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot descriptions and habitats, soil data, site descriptions and habitats, marginal land use, boundary types, and subjective impressions; plus herbarium specimens to verify species records.

- Outputs and data products: structured field sheets (site forms and multiple plot forms), herbarium specimens, soil samples, and a documented data-packaging workflow for transport and archival.

- Field design overview:
  - 16 plots per site, with data collected on a per-plot basis and site-wide information summarized separately.
  - For each plot: four data recording forms and two soil samples; two sets of samples per plot.
  - An additional site-level site description and habitats form to capture analysis of the whole site (within and between plots).

- Plot layout and point-location method:
  - Ground layout uses a center point and right-angle gauge to define plots from 2x2 m up to 14x14 m (and a 14.14 x 14.14 m full plot).
  - Two operators search and document species within each quadrat incrementally, moving outward from the smallest to larger plots.
  - Location accuracy target: approx 20 m radius for each sampling point, with a predetermined control point on the ground; map-based bearing and pacing to reach the sampling point; avoidance of bias in point selection and path.

- Data collection order and emphasis:
  - Data collection order to minimize disturbance: ground flora first, then trees/saplings/shrubs, then soil data; plot description/habitat data interleaved as needed.
  - Specimen collection for uncertain identifications: field cards, labeled bags, and herbarium submission for verification; focus on representative samples and type specimens when possible.

- Ground flora (Quadrat-based sampling):
  - Record presence/absence for five increasing quadrat sizes, with percent cover or abundance estimates for the largest quadrat.
  - Comprehensive bryophyte sampling is conducted as part of vascular plant search within the plot; bryophytes are collected but not broken down by nested quadrats.
  - Complete list of vascular plants and bryophytes is recorded, with specimens stored for herbarium verification.
  - Use a standardized coding system to enter species and a separate “office use” code column for data punching.

- Trees, saplings, and shrubs:
  - Trees: diameter at breast height (DBH) for all stems >5 cm; separate measurement of each stem; dead trees or dead stems marked accordingly.
  - Saplings: height and DBH-like measurements for <5 cm DBH; only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3).
  - Shrubs: recorded in the same diagonally opposite quarters as saplings; same measurement conventions.
  - Height of the largest tree in the plot is recorded using provided height instruments.

- Plot description and habitats:
  - Record habitat attributes (presence/absence) using standard definitions; include slope (via instrument) and aspect; vertically sketch the ground profile for major features.
  - Include a comments section for additional notes not covered by predefined attributes.

- Soil data collection and interpretation:
  - Obtain limited physical/chemical soil data due to scale (1648 plots total) and to enable numerical analysis.
  - Measured properties include pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical analysis (percent sand/silt/clay) with sub-samples retained for future analyses.
  - Soil profile description uses horizon-based interpretation (A0, A1, A2, B1, B2, C, and underlying materials) with standardized horizon definitions and codes.
  - Sample depth for pits described; composite top 10–15 cm sample taken; auger used for deeper horizons; notes on depth limits when augering is shallow.
  - Common woodland soil types discussed: Podzolic soils (acidic, leached), Brown earths, calcareous soils (base-rich on chalk/limestone), hydromorphic soils in wetter areas, skeletal soils, and mosaic patterns due to drainage and landform.
  - Site-level soil typology and horizon interpretation are integrated into the data forms, with guidance on how to record transitions, colors, textures, structure, moisture, and organic content.
  - If a horizon is not present or not observable, mark accordingly and continue with the next horizon; underlying material is recorded when applicable.

- Site Description and Habitats (site-wide data):
  - A separate form (Site Description and Habitats) captures broader site characteristics, including habitat types, land use, and features that extend beyond individual plots.
  - Attributes include marginal land use categories (e.g., orchard, arable, river, road, quarry), boundary types, and human influences.
  - Logical consistency checks between site and plot forms to ensure complete coverage of site features and to identify potential omissions.

- Management and interpretation notes:
  - Management indicators include evidence of planting, coppicing, brashing/pruning, stumps, and other woodland management practices.
  - Interpretation guidance addresses distinguishing planted versus natural origins, coppice history, and signs of regeneration or decay.
  - Documentation emphasizes cross-referencing site and plot data with habitat and management attributes to support robust analyses.

- Data handling, quality assurance, and packaging:
  - Use of standardized forms with sequential attribute codes; office-use codes separate from field data; cross-checks to ensure site and plot numbers are correct.
  - After data collection, forms are stapled, labeled, and packed into four cardboard boxes per site: three for soil samples and one for bryophytes/field sheets; labels and prepaid postage provided for shipping.
  - Herbarium specimens are prepared and submitted with careful labeling and specimen integrity to prevent misidentification; multiple copies and reference to codes used in field sheets.

- Equipment and resources:
  - Field equipment includes plot marking set, compass, tapes, right-angle gauges, center and corner poles, marker pegs, soil auger, mattock, trowel, hypsometer or equivalent height device, sampling bags, and a full set of field maps/maps.
  - Field sheets, labels, spare materials, and back-up supplies are provided to support consistent data collection and documentation.

- Appendices and supplemental guidance:
  - Appendix I: Instructions for herbarium specimen collection and labeling; guidance on specimen selection and coding.
  - Appendix II–VI: Examples of completed forms, plotting and plotting descriptions, soil data collection, and equipment checklists to standardize field procedures.

- Practical considerations and challenges (as highlighted in the manual):
  - Time spent understanding the ask and clarifying data needs within broader teams.
  - Handling patchy or diverse data formats across sites and legacy datasets.
  - Access constraints requiring careful permission handling and contingency planning with backup sites.
  - Communicating complex information in a clear, accessible way for end users and stakeholders.
  - Promoting outputs for broader reuse and encouraging data sharing and standardization across sites.
