# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

- A field handbook detailing the National Woodland Survey 2002 field procedures for collecting, recording, and dispatching data on woodland indicators across multiple plots and sites.
- Emphasizes standardized methods, data quality, and traceable data flows to enable subsequent analysis and data products.

## Purpose and scope

- Provide a consistent protocol for exploring woodland conditions, gathering vegetation, tree, soil, and habitat data, and creating descriptive site-level outputs.
- Support data quality, comparability across sites, and later data analysis, dashboards, or reports.

## Survey design and planning

- Each surveyed site comprises 16 sampling plots, within a defined site description and habitat context.
- Data collection centers on three data datasets per site (plus a site description) and one soil sample per plot, collected and labeled for traceability.
- Prior permission to survey each wood is required; landowner information and contact details must be recorded.
- Location of plots is based on pre-provided maps and ground relocation without reliance on GPS to avoid historical bias.
- A repositioning (relocation) approach uses pacing and compass bearings from the plot location map; scale relationships between map distances and ground distances are provided.
- Be aware of changes since 1971 (e.g., motorway construction or land-use changes); record changes where plots can no longer be surveyed, and avoid surveying on restricted areas.

## Data collection and recording workflow

- Order of data collection per site:
  - One site description and habitat form for the entire site.
  - Three data datasets (each with its own recording form) for each of the 16 plots.
  - One soil sample per plot.
- Recording uses four primary forms per plot:
  - Vegetation plot: Ground flora (presence/absence in five quadrats of increasing size within the 14.14 m x 14.14 m plot) with percent cover estimates for the largest quadrat; major bryophytes recorded.
  - Trees, saplings and shrubs: Species, DBH, and height data across plot quarters; dead trees marked; height measurement options (clinometer or hypsometer); specific treatment for saplings and shrubs in diagonally opposite quarters.
  - Plot description and habitats: Presence/absence data for habitat attributes within the plot to generate frequency data; space for optional comments.
  - Soil sampling: One composite soil sample per plot from the center, top 15 cm, with careful labeling and storage; notes on sampling problems recorded on the plot form.
- Site-level data: A site description and habitat form is completed for the entire site in addition to plot-level data.

## Data formats, coding, and quality control

- Forms are designed to be compatible and easily integrated; attribute codes are provided and structured to allow joint analysis of site and plot data (site code first, plot code in brackets).
- Cross-checks are required between site and plot forms to ensure consistency (attributes present on plot forms must appear on the site form).
- The vegetation data captures presence/absence across progressively larger quadrats, followed by percent cover for all vascular plants, bryophytes, and other categories (litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water).
- Trees, saplings, and shrubs are recorded with species, DBH, and height data; dead trees use specific indicators (e.g., ‘D’ for dead in height/DBH records).
- Plot descriptions and habitat attributes are coded and defined in Appendix IV to support consistent interpretation.
- Soil sampling results are labeled and tracked to corresponding site and plot, with labeling precautions to prevent data loss.

## Data handling, packaging, and submission

- At the end of fieldwork, all forms for a site (4 data sets per plot plus site data) are stapled into a site folder and prepared for data entry.
- Soil samples are dispatched to CEH Merlewood in labeled, sealed containers; timing for dispatch is coordinated to arrive within the sampling week when feasible.
- General equipment and field notes encourage thorough, high-quality data collection, including completion checks to avoid omissions.

## Equipment and logistics

- Field equipment includes maps (1:50,000 extracts and original 2½" maps), letter of introduction for landowners, plot marking gear, compasses, clinometers or hypsometers, DBH tapes, 30 m tapes, and labeling supplies.
- Per-site and per-plot data collection forms:
  - 16 x Vegetation (ground flora) recording forms
  - 16 x Tree, sapling, and shrub recording forms
  - 16 x Plot description sheets
  1 x Site description sheet
- Soil sampling tools include a small digging tool, trowel, ruler, self-sealing bags (16 per site), adhesive labels, and permanent markers.
- Appendices provide field equipment lists, and per-site and per-plot data entry guidelines.

## Appendices and laboratory protocols

- Appendix I–II: Lists of bryophyte species (pilot woodland data and GB-wide lists) to assist ground flora identification.
- Appendix III: Tree, sapling and shrub data forms (structure for recording species, DBH, height, and status).
- Appendix IV: Site description and habitat forms with detailed attribute definitions and coding for site-level interpretation.
- Appendix V: Field equipment inventory and per-site/plot requirements.
- Appendix VI: Soil analysis laboratory protocols (preparation, pH measurement, LOI determination, and related steps).

## Practical considerations and challenges

- Time investment to “understand the ask” is important for data quality; patchy data and multiple formats are addressed by standardized forms and coding.
- Ground relocation prioritizes accuracy and avoidance of bias; GPS usage is discouraged to prevent misalignment with historic plot locations.
- Changes in land use since 1971 are expected; documentation of changes is essential for interpreting results.
- Data outputs are designed to support later data products, dashboards, and analyses by providing rich, standardized, site- and plot-level datasets with clear provenance and labeling.

## End-to-end data implications for data support

- The handbook provides a complete blueprint for collecting, labeling, and aggregating woodland indicator data across sites and plots.
- Ensures data can be combined, compared, and reused in dashboards or analyses by emphasizing standardized data collection, explicit data definitions, cross-form consistency checks, and robust labeling and storage practices.
- Equips data professionals to build self-serve data products, interpret site and plot descriptors, and integrate soil analysis results with vegetation and habitat data.
