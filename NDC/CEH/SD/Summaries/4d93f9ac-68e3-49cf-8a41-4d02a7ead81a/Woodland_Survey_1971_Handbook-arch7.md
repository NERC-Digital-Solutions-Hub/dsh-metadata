# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - Comprehensive field methodology for surveying woodlands to support national woodland classification and data products.
  - Produces map- and plot-based data (species lists, habitat types, soils, and structure) suitable for GIS analyses and policy/management audiences.

- Survey planning and access
  - Prepare an outline plan to minimize travel and coordinate with regional staff; obtain permission from landowners when required.
  - If access is refused, use backup sites and Merlewood-provided information to continue work.
  - Maintain good public relations to clarify that surveys are for conservation and not a purchase program.

- Sampling design and ground layout
  - Each site comprises 16 plots arranged with an organized ground layout (center point, right-angle gauge, corner poles).
  - Nested quadrats for ground flora: start with 2 x 2 m plots and expand through larger quadrats up to 14.14 x 14.14 m (the full plot) to capture species presence and abundance.
  - Aimed ground-location accuracy: locate sampling points within about 20 m of true ground position using a predetermined, unbiased method with a control point and compass bearing (accounting for magnetic variation).

- Data collection at each sampling point
  - Ground flora (vascular plants and bryophytes)
    - Record presence/absence in five quadrat sizes (from 2 x 2 m up to 14.14 x 14.14 m); estimate cover/abundance for vascular plants.
    - Collect bryophyte samples from the plot (noting that bryophyte counts are recorded as a comprehensive plot sample, not by quadrat size), and obtain herbarium specimens for unidentified or noteworthy species.
    - Use standardized nomenclature and office codes for later data entry.

  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs
    - Trees: measure diameter at breast height (DBH) for stems >5 cm; record species, DBH per quarter, note dead trees with a "D" indicator; height of the largest tree is measured.
    - Saplings: trees and shrubs with heights above 50 cm but <5 cm DBH recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3), with the same data fields as trees.
    - Shrubs recorded similarly in opposite quarters; living/dead status noted.

  - Plot description and habitats
    - Record presence/absence of habitat attributes using a defined attribute set and append a ground profile sketch showing major features (slopes, aspect, water features, etc.).
    - Include a short narrative of the site and interpretive comments for later GIS analysis.

  - Soil data
    - Central soil pit and adjacent auger borings to profile the upper 25–30 cm; composite top 10–15 cm sample collected.
    - Use a simplified soil-description approach to capture essential horizons and properties for large-sample analysis (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis, horizon depths, and horizon attributes).
    - Include horizon-by-horizon interpretation (Ao, A1/A2, B1/B2, C/underlying material) with coded attributes for rapid data entry and later modeling.
    - Record depth to horizons, moisture state, color, texture, structure, and presence of features like gleying, mottling, or deposition layers.

- Site-level data and back-up forms
  - Complete a Site Description and Habitats form for the entire site (encompassing plots and inter-plot areas) and a Plot Description and Habitats form for each plot.
  - Use a consistent coding system to link site- and plot-level data; verify consistency and cover any gaps by revisiting parts of the site if needed.

- Herbarium and specimen handling
  - Collect a type specimen for each species where possible; attach with proper labeling and preservation.
  - Use consistent naming codes in field sheets and herbarium sheets to ensure post-field identification accuracy; duplicate specimens are merged in analysis if needed.

- Data handling, quality, and workflow
  - Data are stored on field forms and later punched into office records using standardized codes; forms are organized by site and plot and then bundled for shipment.
  - Emphasizes unbiased data collection and avoidance of subjective point bias when locating sampling points.
  Ensure all components (ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, soil, site/habitat) are complete before site closure.

- Soil interpretation framework (summary)
  - Focuses on Podzolic soils and calcareous soils common in Britain; horizon nomenclature and interpretation (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C) guide the description.
  - Uses a simplified, but informative, horizon-typing scheme to enable large-scale numerical analysis.
  - Notes dynamic, transitional nature of woodland soils (podzolozation, mull vs mor humus types, gleying, peat formation) and the influence of drainage, rainfall, geology, and vegetation on soil properties.

- Data products and GIS implications
  - Spatially explicit data products such as:
    - Ground flora composition and cover by plot and by nested quadrats.
    - Tree regeneration, mature trees, and stand structure (DBH, height, age cues, and deadwood).
    - Habitat and vegetation types, hedges, glades, clearances, and boundaries.
    - Soil types and horizon characteristics, with horizon depths and basic physical/chemical attributes.
    - Site-wide habitat maps, boundary types, marginal land use, and management indicators.
  - Enables GIS-based mapping of woodland types, habitat distribution, regeneration status, and soil thematic maps for policy and conservation planning.

- Equipment and logistics
  - Field equipment includes quadrat layout tools, compasses, tapes, sampling poles, soil augers, trowels, mattocks, herbarium materials, labels, and field sheets.
  - Procedures for packing and shipping samples to maintain data integrity and allow for later analysis.

- Practical challenges highlighted
  - Fragmented data held in multiple places; need for data standards and integration.
  - Need for sufficient technical skills and time for data cleaning, transformation, and quality assurance.
  - Balancing proactive data collection with responding to requests within data feasibility constraints.
  - Large, complex data volumes requiring careful organization and workflow planning.
