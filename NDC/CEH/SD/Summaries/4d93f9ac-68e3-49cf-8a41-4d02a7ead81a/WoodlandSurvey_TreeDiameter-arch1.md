# Woodlands Survey tree diameter data 1971-2001

## Overview
- 1971 survey of 103 broadleaved woodlands across Britain with site-level ecological data and 16 randomly located 200 m2 plots per site.
- Re-surveyed in the growing seasons of 2000, 2002, and 2003 (referred to as '2001') using identical methods.
- Analyses aimed to identify ecological change and drive factors, using variables from survey data and external sources (e.g., atmospheric deposition of sulfur and nitrogen, climate, canopy changes, woodland management).
- Foundational publications for methods and results: Kirkby et al. (2005) and Corney et al. (2004); field methods and analytical results described in these works.

## Survey Design & Methods
- Stratified sampling across the 103 sites; fieldwork conducted with Bunce & Shaw (1973) standardized methods; formal field handbook provided.
- Data collected include canopy and ground flora composition, soil pH, soil organic matter, habitat management, and a wide range of plot- and site-level descriptors.
- Sampling design: 16 plots per site (each 200 m2); repeated measurements across time using identical field protocols.
- Related datasets and background: Countryside Survey; Steele (1968) National/Woodland survey.

## Data Structure
- Site-level and plot-level identifiers:
  - Site (codes 1–103); Plot (1–16); BRC_number (species code); BRC_names (scientific names).
- Taxon aggregation:
  - Amalgams (grouped taxa where needed) and Amalgam_names (scientific names of aggregated taxa).
- Tree status and measurements:
  - Status (Live/Dead); DBHclass (5 cm interval bands); Count (individuals per DBH class); Final_count (count per DBH class per plot; saplings/shrubs multiplied by two due to sampling scheme).
- Year and woody status:
  - Yr (1 = 1971; 2 = 2000s); Woody (woody species flag); Field_sheet (data recording sheet reference).
- DBH class mapping:
  - Detailed ranges and corresponding DBH Class codes (e.g., 0–5 cm → Class 1; up to 156–160 cm → Class 32).

## Usage and Access Notes
- Data were collected to support analysis of long-term ecological change and its drivers; consult Kirkby et al. (2005) and Corney et al. (2004) for methodological specifics and analytical results.
- Supporting documentation and field methods are provided with the dataset; related references include Avery (1973) and Haines-Young et al. (2003).
- Data availability is enhanced by metadata and cross-references to related datasets (e.g., Countryside Survey).
