# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a standardized, field-based methodology to survey woodlands for classification and habitat description.
  - Collects multi-layer data: ground flora, trees and shrubs, plot descriptors, soil profiles, and site-level habitats to enable analysis and comparison across woods.

- Mission-critical challenges addressed
  - Emphasizes reducing travel between sites, obtaining permission, and maintaining good relations with landowners.
  - Encourages data quality through unbiased point location, repeatable plotting, and explicit data recording standards.
  - Strives to create discoverable, well-documented datasets with metadata and herbarium vouchers for species verification.

- Survey planning and permissions
  - Prepare an outline plan of operations to minimize travel and consider accommodation problems.
  - Obtain permission to enter and survey each site; use local contacts and back-up sites if permission is denied.
  - Maintain clear, professional public relations to avoid negative repercussions for the Conservancy.

- Sampling framework and site layout
  - Each site includes up to 16 sampling points; information is provided to identify the correct access points with minimal walking disturbance.
  - Ground sampling point location aims for accuracy within ~20 meters and is achieved by a fixed procedure using control points, map bearings, and predetermined paces.
  - At each sampling point, a center point anchors a series of nested plots with increasing area:
    - 2 x 2 m (4 m²)
    - 5 x 5 m (25 m²)
    - 7.07 x 7.07 m (approx. 50 m²)
    - 10 x 10 m (100 m²)
    - 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m²)
  - The points and plots are laid out using a center post, right-angle gauge, corner posts, and distance strings; markers indicate half-diagonal distances to define smaller plots.

- Data collection per sampling point (four data sets, two soil samples)
  - Ground flora (a): Presence/absence in five successive quadrat sizes; percent cover/abundance estimates for the largest quadrat; comprehensive bryophyte sampling within the full plot.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs (b): 
    - Trees: all stems >5 cm DBH, species, diameter, and status (live/dead) by quadrant; tallest tree height measured with a provided height instrument.
    - Saplings: height < breast height; recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) with the same metrics as trees.
    - Shrubs: recorded in diagonally opposite quarters with same data conventions.
  - Plot description and habitats (c): Presence/absence of habitat attributes; includes a detailed, codified attribute form (Appendix IV) covering slope, aspect, and other landscape features; a centerline section is sketched with a ground profile.
  - Soil data (d): from a central pit and auger borings, plus a composite topsoil sample (10–15 cm). Includes horizon-level recording (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C); limited physical/chemical metrics (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis) to keep data volume manageable across many plots.

- Soil data collection and interpretation
  - Emphasizes a numerical, horizon-based description rather than full-range laboratory analyses.
  - Major woodland soil types highlighted:
    - Podzolic soils (acidic, leached, often podzolizing)
    - Brown earths / brown forest soils
    - Calcareous soils (base-rich, calcium carbonate-containing)
  - Explains drivers of soil behavior: rainfall/evapotranspiration, base content, soil texture, vegetation, and drainage; notes soils are often immature and transitional.
  - Provides a structured interpretation framework for horizons:
    - Ao (organic litter layer)
    - Al (mixed organic/mineral or leached horizons)
    - A2 (eluviated/leached mineral layer)
    - B1/B2 (weathered mineral horizon and/or deposition layers)
    - C (underlying material)
  - Horizon-specific attributes cover color, texture, structure, moisture, iron/mottling, and presence of organic/inorganic features; includes guidance on when horizons are present or not and how to record transitions and underlying material.

- Site Description and Habitat forms
  - A dedicated Site Description and Habitats form (one per site) and a Plot Description and Habitats form (one per plot; site form is more comprehensive).
  - Codes and attribute lists cover management indicators, regeneration indicators, epiphytes, rock/soil features, aquatic habitats, and various habitat types (glades, rocky knolls, hedges, walls, streams, etc.).
  - Includes margins for subjective overall impression and boundary types, with cross-referenced codes to ensure consistent interpretation.

- Herbarium and species verification
  - Collects type specimens for all species observed in quadrats; aim to secure flowering shoots when possible.
  - Keeps labeled specimens with standardized nomenclature and codes; encourages gathering specimens for uncertain identifications and later merging data if duplicates occur.
  - Requires a prepared herbarium for audit and quality assurance of species records.

- Site completion, data handling, and transport
  - After completing all plots and the site form, all sheets are stapled, bagged, and packed into boxes for postal dispatch.
  - Specimen and soil samples are labeled and distributed into appropriate boxes, with pre-paid shipping labels supplied.
  - Emphasizes thorough checking to ensure data are complete and coherent (site number, plot numbers, specimen labels, and sample integrity).

- Field equipment and logistics
  - Lists comprehensive field equipment: plot marking kit (center pole, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings), compasses, tapes, labels, bryophyte/soil bags, herbarium supplies, mattock, auger, trowel, hypsometer, and other general field tools.
  - Provides practical guidance for equipment management, transport, and field station logistics.

- Appendices and instructions
  - Appendix I: herbarium specimen collection instructions
  - Appendix II–VI: examples of completed forms, plotting and site description instructions, soil data collection instructions, and equipment checklists
  - Emphasizes standardization and replicability across teams and sites.

- Data integrity and analytic relevance
  - The handbook outlines standardized, codified data collection to enable cross-site comparisons and subsequent statistical analyses.
  - Focuses on combining topic-specific expertise (botany, ecology, soil science) with rigorous data collection, cleaning, and documentation to support robust interpretation and reporting.
