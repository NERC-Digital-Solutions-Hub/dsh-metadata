# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

## Overview and Purpose
- A comprehensive field-methods handbook for surveying and describing woodlands, focusing on standardised data collection across multiple plots and sites.
- Covers planning, access, sampling point location, data recording, soil data, herbarium collection, and data packaging for centralized analysis.
- Aims to produce consistent, high-quality data suitable for long-term analysis of woodland structure, habitats, flora, fauna, and soils.

## Data Scope and Asset Model
- Data assets include: site descriptions, plot descriptions, ground flora, tree/sapling/shrub data, habitat attributes, soil profiles, and ancillary observations (fauna, fungi, epiphytes, etc.).
- Data are captured on standardized forms and codes (site and plot forms with linked attribute codes) to enable uniform data punching and later analysis.
- Long-term data stewardship emphasized: “data you are collecting is being collected ‘forever’,” with centralized handling, storage, and dispatch via post.

## Access, Permissions, and Stakeholder Engagement
- Clear procedures for obtaining permission to survey sites; owners’ concerns acknowledged and addressed with tact.
- Public relations are essential; if permission is withheld, back-up sites are used from Merlewood.
- Coordination with Regional Office and Merlewood to determine whether advance permissions apply or if direct owner contact is needed.
- If access is limited, alternative back-up sites and provided information (maps, sampling points) enable continued work.

## Survey Planning and Site Access
- Prepare an outline plan to minimise travel while considering access constraints.
- Use road maps and site maps to locate the 22" or required-scale sites; determine best access points to minimise walking distance.
- Avoid disrupting surroundings; use marked tracks and footpaths; respect land boundaries and permissions.
- Maintain good public relations and clearly communicate the purpose of surveys to landowners.

## Sampling Design and Point Location
- Each site has a fixed layout: 16 random sampling points marked on the site map, with clear ground-trace methods.
- Primary locating principles:
  - Accuracy: aim to locate each sampling point within 20 m of its true position.
  - Unbiased ground-truthing: minimize subjective bias in choosing ground locations.
- Ground-point localisation steps:
  - Select the next point, identify a control point on the ground, orient the map with compass, measure distance, identify the ground point, and pace out the distance with slope correction as needed.
  - Adhere strictly to predetermined paces and directions to reduce bias.

## Data Recording and Data Flow (What, When, How)
- Data are collected in four data sets per site per point, plus two soil samples per plot:
  - (a) Ground flora presence/absence across five increasing quadrats with % cover estimates; comprehensive vascular plant and bryophyte sampling.
  - (b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, diameter (DBH) for trees >5 cm, height for the largest tree, sapling and shrub data in diagonally opposite plot quarters.
  - (c) Plot description and habitat data: presence/absence of defined attributes; slopes, aspect, and a ground-profile sketch.
  - (d) Soil data: soil pit and auger cores at plot center; composite topsoil sample (10–15 cm) collected.
- Order of recording prioritises ground flora first to avoid disturbance; trees and soil data follow.
- Site-level data (Site Description and Habitats) collected separately for the whole site, including in-between-plot areas and boundary zones.
- Completion involves data verification, packing forms, collecting samples, and dispatch in labeled boxes.

## Ground Flora and Vegetation Recording (Quadrat Method)
- Quadrats and layout:
  - Start with 2x2 m plots, then extend to 14.14x14.14 m plot, and record species in each quadrat size.
  - A centre post with a right-angle gauge and four corner poles establish quadrats; markers denote half-diagonal distances.
  - Spiral outward search pattern by two operators to cover the entire area.
- Recording details:
  - Record all vascular plants and bryophytes (comprehensive bryophyte collection for herbarium is required but bryophytes are not recorded in the same granularity as vascular plants).
  - Specimens for herbarium collected at first occurrence; label specimens with field IDs; preserve for later verification.
  - After presence data, estimate total cover for the full plot and enter into code tables; use “office” code numbers for later data punching.
- Post-field handling: specimens and forms are collected, labeled, bagged, and sent to the herbarium and Merlewood respectively.

## Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs
- Trees: record species and diameter for all stems >5 cm DBH; multi-stemmed trees noted; dead trees/stems marked distinctly.
- Saplings: record in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) with height and diameter data.
- Shrubs: recorded in diagonally opposite quarters; data as for trees.
- Largest tree height recorded with a provided instrument; substitute if necessary if obstruction occurs.

## Plot Description and Habitats
- Attributes captured as presence/absence with defined definitions (Appendix IV for full definitions).
- Includes slope, aspect, and a ground-profile sketch capturing major landscape features.
- A separate, concise site form collects broader habitat context (habitats, glades, water bodies, woodland types, etc.).

## Site Description and Habitats (Site-wide)
- A separate form captures site-level habitat types, boundaries, and management context.
- Codes differentiate micro-habitats (e.g., bogs, cliffs, gorges), and relationships to plots.
- Ensures compatibility with plot data via cross-referencing attribute codes and site/plot codes.

## Soil Data Collection and Interpretation
- Rationale: large-scale survey (1648 plots) requires a limited set of measurements plus a numerical soil description framework.
- Physical/chemical measures:
  - pH
  - Loss on ignition
  - Mechanical analysis (particle size distribution, sand/silt/clay)
- Horizons and profile interpretation:
  - Ao (litter), Al (leached/eluviated mineral), A2 (mineral with eluviation sign), B1/B2 (deposition and weathered mineral layer), C (underlying material)
  - Emphasis on horizon presence/absence, transitions, colour, texture, structure, and moisture.
  - Humus types (Mull, MODER, MOR) and gleying considerations noted.
- Major woodland soil types in Britain:
  - Podzolic soils (acid, leached, podzols) with transitions to hydromorphic and skeletal soils where drainage is impeded.
  - Brown earths and brown forest soils.
  - Calcareous soils (Rendzina on chalk/limestone; deeper variations with base-rich rocks).
- Soil profile recording:
  - Depths, horizon limits, and descriptive attributes are methodically recorded to reflect pedogenic processes.
  - When horizons are poorly defined in a given horizon, best approximations are allowed with clear notation.

## Data Management, Coding, and Quality Control
- Forms are coded and cross-referenced; site and plot forms use sequential codes with office-use fields for data punching.
- Checks for logical consistency between site and plot forms; ensure all recorded attributes reflect observed areas.
- Data packaging protocol:
  - Complete site data (4 data sets + 2 soil samples per plot) stapled and bagged.
  - Boxes prepared with weight limits and prepaid shipping labels for efficient transport.
- Herbarium and soil data accompany the field sheets as documented in appendices.

## Appendices and Tools
- Appendix I: Instructions for collecting herbarium specimens.
- Appendix II–VI: Examples of completed ground flora forms, tree/sapling forms, plot/site descriptions, soil data forms, and equipment checklists.
- Equipment lists and field tools for marking plots, collecting samples, preserving specimens, and recording data.

## Challenges and Considerations for Data Leaders
- Data accessibility and consistency across scattered data sources; reliance on field-based data entry and multiple back-up sites.
- Achieving standardized data collection across diverse woodland types, terrains, and owner permissions.
- Managing metadata, codes, and cross-form linkages to enable robust analysis and data discoverability.
- Ensuring long-term data integrity, storage, and sharing mechanisms beyond field campaigns.
