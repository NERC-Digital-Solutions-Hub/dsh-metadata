# Botanical material

- Study material: seeds from 14 Cerrado species collected across five rural Brazilian sites (Parque Nacional da Serra do Cipó, Minas Gerais; Reserva Natural Serra do Tombador, Goiás; Parque Estadual do Jalapão, Tocantins; Estação Ecológica de Itirapina and Estação Ecológica de Assis, São Paulo). Coordinates are provided for each site, illustrating geographic and ecological diversity.
- Sampling scheme: seeds from different species collected, with at least ten individuals per species from distinct populations, following standard biodiversity sampling guidelines.
- Storage conditions: seeds stored in Ziplock bags at approximately 20 °C with relative humidity below 40%.

- Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis:
  - Objective: ultrastructural analysis of the seed integument surface to explore relationships between seed/fruit structure and fire adaptation.
  - Procedure: representative samples (one seed per species) fixed in Karnovsky solution, dehydrated through an alcohol series, dried via critical point drying with CO2, mounted on aluminum supports, and coated with gold (30–40 nm).
  - Instrumentation: imaging performed with a Carl Zeiss EVO LS15 SEM.
  - Data produced: high-resolution surface images used to characterize seed coat ultrastructure across species.

- Table 1 (metadata summary):
  - Contains studied species, families, date and location of seed collection, and physiognomy.
  - Families represented include Melastomataceae (several species), Xyridaceae, Velloziaceae, among others.
  - Collection dates range from 2014 to 2020; locations cover EEA, EEI, RNST, PNSC, and PEJ, with physiognomies such as Campo sujo and related habitats.

- Quality control and data notes:
  - Files provided as created; no additional data checks described.
  - Scale information is embedded within image files to support proper interpretation of SEM results.
