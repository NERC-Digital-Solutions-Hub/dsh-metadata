# Botanical material

- Study basis: Seeds from 14 Cerrado-native species collected across multiple rural sites in Brazil to assess fire-adaptation-related seed/fruit structure via scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
- Collection sites and coordinates: 
  - Parque Nacional da Serra do Cipó, Minas Gerais
  - Reserva Natural Serra do Tombador, Goiás
  - Parque Estadual do Jalapão, Tocantins
  - Estação Ecológica de Itirapina, São Paulo
  - Estação Ecológica de Assis, São Paulo
- Sampling design: Seeds collected from different species with at least ten individuals per species from distinct populations; seeds stored in Ziplock bags at -20 °C with relative humidity < 40%.
- Data types and purpose: Morphological seed data and SEM images to link seed/fruit surface structure with fire-adaptation.

## Scanning Electron Microscopy

- Representative sampling for SEM: One seed per species (as detailed in Table 1) used for ultrastructural analysis of the seed integument.
- Sample preparation:
  - Fixation in Karnovsky solution
  - Dehydration through an alcohol series
  - Critical point drying using CO2
  - Mounting on aluminum supports with conductive carbon tape
  - Metalization with gold (30–40 nm)
- Imaging: Scanning electron microscopy performed with a Carl Zeiss EVO LS15
- Objective: Provide ultrastructural insight into seed/fruit surface and relate structure to fire-adaptation.

- For each species: collection date(s) and site (EEA, EEI, RNST, PNSC, PEJ) and physiognomy (e.g., Campo sujo, Campo úmido), indicating habitat context and sampling diversity.
- Note: Table 1 captures species identity, family, collection details, and physiognomic context.

## Quality control and data provenance

- Data handling: Files provided as created; no additional quality checks recorded.
- Metadata and scale: Scale provided within the image files.
- References for methods and trait measurement standards cited (e.g., Karnovsky 1965; Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013) to support reproducibility.

## Implications for data leadership

- Provenance and reproducibility: The document emphasizes clear provenance (species, family, collection dates, locations, habitats) and standardized sample preparation for SEM, which supports reproducibility and data integrity.
- Metadata completeness: Detailed geographic and habitat metadata accompany each specimen, illustrating best practices for data discoverability and reuse.
- Data management considerations: For data stewards, align similar datasets with standardized metadata schemas, ensure raw SEM images and processing steps are stored together, and maintain links to collection context to enable cross-site analyses and broader data sharing.
