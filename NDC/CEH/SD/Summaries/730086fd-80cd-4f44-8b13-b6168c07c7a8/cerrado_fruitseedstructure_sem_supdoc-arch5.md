# Botanical material

## Scope and source materials
- Seeds from 14 Cerrado native species collected from multiple rural Brazilian locations: Parque Nacional da Serra do Cipó (Minas Gerais), Reserva Natural Serra do Tombador (Goiás), Parque Estadual do Jalapão (Tocantins), Estação Ecológica de Itirapina and Estação Ecológica de Assis (São Paulo).
- For each species, seeds collected from at least ten individuals across different populations.
- Seeds stored in Ziplock bags at 20 °C with relative humidity below 40%.

## Data collection and methods
- Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) used to image seed coats for ultrastructural analysis to explore relationships between seed/fruit structure and fire adaptation.
- Representative sampling: one seed per species imaged (as listed in Table 1).
- Sample preparation: fixation in Karnovsky solution, dehydration in an alcohol series, critical point drying with CO2, mounting on aluminum supports, gold coating (30–40 nm), imaging with a Carl Zeiss EVO LS15 SEM.
- Table 1 (Table provided in the document) records studied species, families, collection dates and locations, and seed physiognomy.

## Dataset and metadata
- Document includes a table detailing:
  - Species and family (e.g., Acisanthera alsinaefolia, Melastomataceae; Xyris spp., Xyridaceae; etc.)
  - Collection dates (e.g., January 2020; September 2015; 2014–2020 range)
  - Collection locations (EEA, EEI, RNST, PNSC, PEJ)
  - Seed physiognomy context (e.g., Campo sujo, Campo rupestre, etc.)
- Data components include descriptive metadata about collection sites, species, and sample provenance.

## Quality control and data provenance
- Data/files provided as originally created; no additional quality checks documented.
- Scale bars are included within the image files to aid interpretation.
- References cited for methods and standards used (Karnovsky fixative; Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013 standard plant trait measurements).

## Data governance and sharing considerations for data stewards
- Metadata completeness: ensure Table 1-like provenance details (species, family, location codes, dates, physiognomy) are captured in a dataset-level metadata record.
- Reproducibility: document SEM protocols, fixation, dehydration, drying, coating, and instrument settings to enable replication.
- Provenance and lineage: preserve collection sites, dates, and population diversity (minimum ten individuals per species) to support traceability.
- Storage and access: seeds stored at 20 °C with RH < 40%; imaging data linked to specimen metadata; consider persistent identifiers for species, sites, and samples.
- Data standards alignment: reference to standardized plant trait measurement practices (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013) suggests aligning imaging and descriptive metadata to recognized ontologies and schemas.
- Potential gaps: reliance on a single representative seed per species for SEM; consider documenting rationale and, if possible, linking additional images or higher-replication data to strengthen use by data users.
