# Seed ultrastructure and fire-adaptation in Cerrado species: Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis of 14 native seeds

- Overview
  - Study uses scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze the ultrastructure of seed integuments from 14 Cerrado native species, aiming to illuminate relationships between seed/fruit structure and fire-adaptation.
  - Seeds were collected from multiple Brazilian reserves and stored under controlled conditions before imaging.
  - At least ten individuals per species were sampled to capture population-level variation.

- Materials and sampling
  - Locations: Parque Nacional da Serra do Cipó (Minas Gerais), Reserva Natural Serra do Tombador (Goiás), Parque Estadual do Jalapão (Tocantins), Estação Ecológica de Itirapina and Assis (São Paulo).
  - Species (14 total) span primarily Melastomataceae (Acisanthera alsinaefolia; Cambessedesia hilariana; Microlicia sp.; Pleroma cardinale; Pleroma frigidula; Pleroma stenocarpum; Stenodon campestre; Tibouchina melastomoides) and Velloziaceae or Xyridaceae representatives (Vellozia seubertiana; Vellozia squamata; Vellozia variabilis; Xyris hilariana; Xyris jupicai; Xyris paradisiaca).
  - Seed collection details: seeds from different species collected from different populations, with dates noted (as per Table 1); seeds stored in Ziplock bags at 20 °C with relative humidity below 40%.

- Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) methods
  - Representative samples (one seed per species) prepared for ultrastructural analysis of the seed integument surface.
  - Fixation: Karnovsky solution.
  - Dehydration: via an ethanol series; drying by critical point with CO2.
  -Mounting: on aluminum supports with conductive tape; coated with gold (30–40 nm).
  - Imaging: performed with a Carl Zeiss EVO LS15 SEM.
  - Purpose: to link seed/fruit surface structure with fire-adaptation characteristics.

- Quality control and data provenance
  - Files are provided as created with no further checks recorded.
  - Scale bars are included within the image files to support interpretation.
  - Key methodological references cited for fixation, imaging, and standard measurement practices:
    - Karnovsky (1965) for fixative formulation
    - Perez-Harguindeguy et al. (2013) for standardised plant trait measurements
    - Zirondi et al. (2019) and related works on fire-related germination and seed coat differences

- Implications for monitoring frameworks and data governance
  - Demonstrates a rigorous, standardized approach to collecting and imaging seed traits across multiple sites, contributing to cross-site comparability in environmental monitoring.
  - Highlights the importance of comprehensive metadata (species, family, collection date, location, physiognomy) to enable data reuse in monitoring programs.
  - Notes potential data-sharing considerations (raw data and imaging files provided as-is) that can inform data governance and openness in environmental health monitoring contexts.
  - The methodology provides a model for integrating morphological seed data with fire ecology insights, useful for informing policy decisions on fire management and biodiversity monitoring in the Cerrado.
