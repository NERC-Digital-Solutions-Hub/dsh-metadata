## Aim
- To analyze seeds from 14 Cerrado species using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to relate seed/fruit surface ultrastructure to fire-adaptation.
- To employ a standardised, replicable approach that supports cross-species comparisons and potential integration with broader environmental monitoring datasets.

## Data collection and sampling design
- Seeds collected from 14 native Cerrado species across multiple rural areas and protected reserves:
  - Parque Nacional da Serra do Cipó, Minas Gerais
  - Reserva Natural Serra do Tombador, Goiás
  - Parque Estadual do Jalapão, Tocantins
  - Estação Ecológica de Itirapina, São Paulo
  - Estação Ecológica de Assis, São Paulo
- For each species, seeds were collected from at least ten individuals across different populations.
- Seeds stored in Ziplock bags at 20 °C with relative humidity below 40%.

## Methods: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
- Representative samples (one seed per species) fixed in Karnovsky solution for ultrastructural analysis of the seed integument surface.
- Preparation steps:
  - Dehydration in an alcohol series
  - Critical point drying using CO2 (Leica EM CPD300)
  - Mounting on aluminum supports with conductive carbon tape
  - Gold sputter-coating (30–40 nm)
  - Analysis with a Carl Zeiss EVO LS15 SEM
- The SEM aims to illuminate relationships between seed/fruit structure and fire-adaptation.

## Table 1 (summary)
- Contains studied species, families, collection dates, physiognomy, and location details (EEA, EEI, RNST, PNSC, PEJ), reflecting the diverse sampling across sites.
