# Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in soil profiles at the Glensaugh and Ballogie MOORCO 'BIG' experimental tree planting sites.

## Purpose and scope
- Single CSV file containing data for both Glensaugh and Ballogie MOORCO-BIG sites.
- 320 records; period of record: 10–12 Nov 2021.
- Measures 13C and 15N isotopic composition for organic soil profiles (from the LFH horizon through the top of the E horizon).
- Includes total soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and bulk density (DBf).

## Study context
- MOORCO-BIG experiment: experimental tree planting on heather moorland in North East Scotland, established 2005.
- Plots fenced/planted with Birch (Betula pubescens) and Pine (Pinus sylvestris) at 1 m spacing; unplanted heather controls.
- Replication: n = 4 blocks at Glensaugh and n = 3 blocks at Ballogie.
- Maintained by the James Hutton Institute.

## Sampling and field methodology
- Soils sampled with 5 x 5 cm steel box corers.
- 4 random cores per plot; sampled to full organic horizon depth plus top 2 cm of mineral soil.
- LFH horizon partitioned into top/bottom halves; organic horizons partitioned as needed based on field appearance.
- Horizons (field) recorded and cores split in the field; samples kept chilled until processing.

## Laboratory processing
- Cores air-dried at 30°C for 2–3 weeks; samples weighed to determine dry weight.
- Organic horizons: stones and roots >2 mm removed; material milled to <2 mm and combined for sub-sampling.
- LFH and organic samples: a subsample oven-dried at 105°C for 24 h to determine oven-dry weight; remainder ball milled (3–5 min at 30 rev/s).
- Mineral horizon samples sieved to 2 mm; all horizon samples ball-milled for isotope analysis.

## Chemical analyses
- Total C and N content determined by automated Dumas combustion using a Carlo Erba NA 1500 Elemental Analyser.

## Isotope analyses
- 13C and 15N isotopic compositions analyzed by EA-IRMS (Europa EA-GSL interfaced to HS2022 IRMS).
- Samples combusted at 1000°C with chromium oxide and silvered copper oxide; CO2 and N2 separated and measured separately due to high soil C:N ratios.

## Calculations and data units
- Carbon stock calculations use dry bulk density, core length, and %C to yield stock in g cm^-2, then kg m^-2 and t ha^-1.
- Stone volume and oven-dry weights used to correct for coarse fractions and moisture content.
- Key recorded variables include: depth, horizon, horizon-specific data, bulk density (DBf), %C, %N, C:N ratio, soil moisture content (%SMC), % dry weight, C stock (kg m^-2), delta-13C VPDB, delta-15N Air.
- Data structure includes detailed field and lab descriptors (Site, Date, Sample.ID, Species, Quadrat, Horizon, Depth.cm, volume.cm3, g.OD.soil.plus.roots, OD.stones.g, calc.stone.vol.cm3, dry.bulk.density.DBf.g.per.cm3, per.C, per.N, CN.ratio, C.stock.kg.per.m2, per.SMC, per.DWT, delta.13.C.VPDB, delta.15.N.Air).

## Quality control
- Data quality checks involved verifying value ranges against ecologically realistic bounds and inspecting value distributions; no outliers or unrealistic values identified.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized isotopic and stock data to assess soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics during tree planting on moorland.
- Facilitates cross-site comparisons (Glensaugh vs Ballogie) and temporal monitoring when combined with other MOORCO datasets.
- Supports evaluation of ecosystem carbon sequestration potential and the effects of afforestation treatments on soil C and N pools.
