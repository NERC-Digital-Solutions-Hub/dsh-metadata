# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2021

- The document is a user guide for LCM2021, the UKCEH land cover map produced annually.
- LCM2021 comprises six datasets (three for Great Britain and three for Northern Ireland) at multiple scales, classified using automated methods and validated for accuracy.

## Key aims and context

- Purpose: describe data production, validation, and accuracy to help users apply LCM2021 appropriately.
- Annual production aims to improve temporal consistency, comparability, and change detection; classify Classification Scenes using Bootstrap Training and Random Forest.
- Formal validation reports an overall accuracy of 82.6% at full thematic detail.

## UKCEH Land Cover Classes and mapping context

- 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are defined, aligned with UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats but not identical to them.
- Some BAP terms are italicised to avoid ambiguity when referring to BAP Broad Habitats vs. UKCEH classes.
- The relationship between UKCEH Land Cover Classes, UK BAP Broad Habitats, and Aggregate Classes is described; some exceptions apply (e.g., Freshwater vs. Saltwater distinctions).

  - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
- An official list/citation of datasets is provided in Appendix 3.
- Additional products at 1 km resolution:
  - Dominant cover (1-band)
  - Percentage cover for 21 classes (1-band) and 10 aggregate classes (1-band)
- Coordinate systems:
  - GB: British National Grid, EPSG 27700
  - NI: Irish Grid TM75, EPSG 29903
- Parcel counts and extents:
  - GB parcels: ~6.74 million
  - NI parcels: ~902k
  - Parcel framework minimum mapping unit: ~0.5 hectares

## Data products: structure and content

- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets
  - Created by mosaicking classified Classification Scenes; each pixel has:
    - Band 1: most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class (integer)
    - Band 2: classification confidence (probability)
  - Not generalised by the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine landscape detail (e.g., narrow features below the MMU of 0.5 ha).
  - Validation for these pixels was not conducted against the 10 m dataset but against the 25 m Land Parcel dataset.
- Land Parcel datasets
  - Generated by intersecting the 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - Provide parcel-level attributes (Table 3 in the document) including:
    - gid, _hist (pixel class frequency per parcel), _mode (dominant class), _conf (mean class membership probability), _stdev, _agg (aggregate class), _n (number of 10 m pixels in parcel).
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Raster version of parcels at 25 m resolution with 3 attributes per parcel:
    - Band 1: dominant land cover (mode)
    - Band 2: mean confidence (_conf)
    - Band 3: parcel-level purity (_purity)
- 1 km raster products
  - Summaries of 25 m data to 1 km pixels:
    - Dominant cover for GB/UKCEH classes and aggregates (1-band)
    - Percentage cover for 21 classes and 10 aggregates (1-band per class/aggregate)
  - Note: percentage values are integers and may not sum exactly to 100 due to rounding; coastal pixels may sum to less than 100.

## Seasonal and contextual data used for classification

- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Derived from Google Earth Engine; Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data resampled to 10 m.
  - Four seasons: Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec; 10 Sentinel-2 bands used.
  - Occasional cloud gaps are tolerated by the classifier, ensuring full UK coverage.
- Context Rasters
  - Purpose: reduce spectral confusion between land cover types.
  - GB context rasters (10 m): height, aspect, slope; distance to nearest building, road, sea, freshwater; foreshore and tidal water masks; woodland mask.
  - NI context rasters (10 m): height, aspect, slope; urban mask; distance to coast, freshwater, road; foreshore and tidal water masks.
- Classification Scenes
  - GB: 32 Classification Scenes based on a modified OS 100 x 100 km tile grid; each scene is trained and classified independently.
  - NI: 1 Classification Scene (40-band Sentinel-2 image) combined with NI context rasters to yield 49-band classification scene.
  - Scenes are designed to manage regional phenology and ensure robust training data.

## The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework

- The framework provides the real-world unit for parcel-level analysis.
- Minimum parcel size is ~0.5 hectares (MMU).
- Parcels are derived from generalized national cartography; the framework helps reduce classification noise and enables change detection.
- Unique parcel identifiers (gid) do not match LCM2015 identifiers due to framework reorganization.

## Bootstrap Training and classification methodology

- Bootstrap Training
  - An automatic training data generation method that uses historic land maps to sample current satellite images for classifier training.
  - Requires wall-to-wall historic coverage; helps produce large training datasets without field collection.
- Random Forest (RF) classification
  - Training samples derived from Bootstrap Training parcels; 10,000 samples per bag with replacement to balance class representation.
  - RF classifier yields the 10 m Classified Pixel product.
  - The workflow balances learning to avoid dominance by more common classes.
- Software and tools
  - Custom UKCEH pipeline integrating WEKA, PostGIS, and GDAL; uses open-source technologies.

## Validation and accuracy

- Validation dataset: 35,182 reference points across all 21 classes.
- Overall accuracy: 82.6% (95% CI 82.19%–82.99%) at full thematic detail.
- Validation approach: point-based comparison against 25 m rasterised parcel data.
- Appendix 4 provides detailed error matrices and producer/user accuracy per class.

## Data quality, caveats, and usage guidance

- 10 m Classified Pixel data are not generalised to the Land Parcel Spatial Framework, which means:
  - Greater detail but higher noise for very small features and mosaic patches.
  - Users should be aware that formal validation is conducted against the 25 m parcel data, not the 10 m pixel mosaic.
- The relationship between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats is complex; mappings may show inter-class confusion in some landscapes (e.g., bog vs. acid/fen grasslands, heather vs. heather grassland).
- Saltwater and freshwater separation relies on coastal/context rasters; some coastal and tidal features may experience occasional confusion near the coast.
- The parcel framework and class definitions may evolve; direct comparability with older LCM versions that used different parcel IDs may be limited.

## Practical guidance for GIS use

- Data are intended for map-based visualization and analysis, with a clear emphasis on spatial context and change detection over time.
- Use the 10 m pixel data for detailed landscape features; refer to the 25 m parcel data for robust parcel-level analyses and time-series comparisons.
- For summary or broad-scale products, utilize the 1 km dominant/percentage products.
- Follow the color recipes (Appendix 5 and Appendix 6) for consistent, accessible visualization of UKCEH Land Cover Classes.
