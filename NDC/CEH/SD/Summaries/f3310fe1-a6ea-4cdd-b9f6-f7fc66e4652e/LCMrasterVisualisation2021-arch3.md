# Visualising UKCEH Land Cover Class using a GIS application

- Purpose: A short guide for visualising the UKCEH Land Cover Class data (2021) in common GIS applications to support environmental monitoring and decision-making.
- Data structure:
  - 10m rasters: two bands
    - Band 1 = UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier
    - Band 2 = classification confidence
  - 25m rasters: three bands
    - Band 1 = dominant UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier
    - Bands 2–3 = classification confidence
- Focus: The guide concentrates on visualising Band 1 (the class identifiers). A full data description is in the product documentation.
- Visualisation workflow by platform:
  - QGIS
    - Add the file to the project; layer appears in the layers panel.
    - Layer > Properties > Symbology > Render type: Paletted/Unique values; Band: Band 1.
    - Click Style > Load style, select LCMcolours_QGIS.qml, open.
    - OK to redraw the map with the correct classification.
  - ArcGIS Desktop
    - In the catalogue, locate the data; expand to view raster bands.
    - Drag Band_1 into the Table of Contents.
    - Layer Properties > Symbology > Unique Values > Import.
    - Load LCMcolours.lyr, OK.
    - The map will be redrawn with the correct classification.
  - ArcGIS Pro
    - Catalog > folder} > expand to view raster’s bands; drag Band_1 into the Table of Contents.
    - Layer Properties > Appearance > Symbology; set to Unique Values.
    - If prompted to build an attribute table, choose Yes.
    - Use the hamburger menu in the Symbology panel > Import; load LCMcolours.lyr.
    - The map will be redrawn with the correct classification.
- Style/file availability: The accompanying style files (LCMcolours_QGIS.qml for QGIS and LCMcolours.lyr for ArcGIS) ensure consistent, accurate classification colors.
- Additional note: For a complete description of the data, refer to the product documentation; this guide focuses on practical visualization steps to support monitoring workflows.
