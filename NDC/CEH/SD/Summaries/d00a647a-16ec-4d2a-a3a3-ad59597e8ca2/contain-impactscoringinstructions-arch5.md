# Impact scoring sheet

- This document provides instructions for completing an impact scoring sheet to assess ecological impacts of invasive taxa using EICAT categories.
- You will work with three Excel sheets: (i) metadata & basic information, (ii) impact scoring sheet, and (iii) lists. Only the first two should be completed; the third is for reference and must not be modified.
- You must fill out the first two sheets yourself, keeping the Unique ID field unchanged.

## Purpose and scope

- Evaluate impacts of invasive species with and without management, considering both reported and potential impacts, and positive and negative directions.
- Use a standardized classification scheme (EICAT) to describe impact outcomes, mechanisms, and confidence levels.
- Generate rows for each combination of impact outcome and species/asset to capture specific relationships and support comparability across datasets.

## Data and fields to complete

- Impact outcomes: Select one category from a predefined drop-down list (consult the lists sheet). Add one row per outcome/species combination; you may duplicate outcomes for different native species with different species/asset names.
- Impact mechanism: Select a mechanism from a predefined drop-down list (consult the lists sheet).
- Maximum impact level (EICAT Category): Select from the EICAT category list (Data Deficient, Minimal Concern, Minor, Moderate, Major, Massive).
- Level of confidence: Select High, Medium, or Low with defined criteria.
- Species or asset impacted: Name the affected native species or asset.
- Direction of the impact: Positive or negative.
- Comments and other details: Any contextual notes you want to capture.
- References and supporting information: Include links or references to sources (papers, reports, expert communications, etc.).

## Core classifications and definitions

- Impact mechanisms include: Competition, Predation, Hybridisation, Disease transmission, Parasitism, Poisoning/Toxicity, Bio-fouling, Grazing/herbivory/browsing, Chemical/physical/structural impact on ecosystems, Interaction with other alien species.
- EICAT categories (based on Hawkins et al. 2015) define the severity of impacts from invasive taxa:
  - Data Deficient (DD)
  - Minimal Concern (MC)
  - Minor (MN)
  - Moderate (MO)
  - Major (MR)
  - Massive (MV)
- Category descriptions provide guidance on whether the impact affects population sizes, community structure, or leads to extinctions, including whether changes are reversible if the alien taxon is removed.
- For each category, there are row-specific criteria across mechanisms (e.g., competition, predation) to help determine the precise classification.

## Confidence and evidence

- Level of confidence indicates the robustness of the assessment (High, Medium, Low) and is informed by direct observational evidence, spatial scale relevance, data quality, and interpretability.
- The document supports including potential impacts where direct observations are not available, expanding the evidentiary basis for scoring.

## Process and workflow guidance

- Complete the two specified sheets thoroughly and consistently; use the top-right tooltips in the impact scoring sheet for column-specific instructions.
- Do not modify the third sheet (lists) as it serves as a reference.
- Each row should pair an impact outcome with a species/asset and include supporting references.
- After completion, return the scoring sheet for review; if questions arise, contact the designated contacts provided.

## Relevance to data governance and stewardship

- Enables standardized, auditable capture of invasive-species impacts, supporting data interoperability across datasets and portals.
- Encourages comprehensive metadata, provenance, and evidence links, aligning with governance practices for quality assurance and traceability.
- Facilitates timely updates and documentation of work performed, respecting data availability, embargoes, and related sharing limitations.
- Supports data creators and users by providing a publishable, reproducible framework for assessing ecological impacts.

## Appendices and references

- Impact mechanisms and EICAT categories definitions are drawn from Hawkins et al. (2015) with an accompanying decision tree to guide category assignment.
- Level of confidence criteria are adapted to reflect both observed and potential impacts, and to account for data quality and relevance.
- References and supporting information should include relevant papers, reports, and communications to justify assessments.
