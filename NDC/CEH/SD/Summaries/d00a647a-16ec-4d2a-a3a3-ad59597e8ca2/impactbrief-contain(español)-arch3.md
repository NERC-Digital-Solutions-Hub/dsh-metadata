# CONTAIN: Optimising the long-term management of invasive species affecting biodiversity and the rural economy using adaptive management

## Context
- Invasive exotic species cause significant environmental, social, and economic impacts, both negative and positive.
- Management should consider impacts rather than focusing solely on the species; for non-eradicable invasives, aim to mitigate negative impacts or adapt to them.
- Management must incorporate diverse societal and community perspectives of those affected.

## Methodology and process for prioritising impacts and management actions
- Invasive species management is complex and requires representative social perspectives.
- The CONTAIN project developed a three-stage process to identify and prioritise impacts and to determine appropriate actions.
- Applied by 20 project participants across Argentina, Chile, and Brazil to seven management examples.
- Three consecutive stages:
  1. Inventory of impacts and affected resources using a standardized IUCN method, capturing both positive and negative impacts and sources; ensure representativeness of societal perspectives (expert, manager, decision-maker, and community views).
  2. Prioritisation of impacts by magnitude and uncertainty and definition of action type for each prioritized impact: do nothing, monitor, further researching, or actively manage.
  3. Definition of quantitative indicators and measures to monitor impacts and to evaluate the effectiveness of management actions.

## Results and examples
- Table 1 presents two prioritized impacts and corresponding quantitative indicators from real CONTAIN contexts:
  - Invasive pines in Chile:
    - Prioritized impacts: altered fire regime, damages to agriculture, altered hydrological characteristics and water quality/moisture, reduced native biodiversity, altered recreational and tourism uses.
    - Quantitative indicators: fire/load fuel, herbaceous productivity, hydrological flow models, presence/ richness of exotic species, human landscape preferences.
  - American mink in Argentina:
    - Prioritized impacts: population decline, changes in cultural/educational/aesthetic/ornamental values.
    - Quantitative indicators: reproductive success of native birds affected by mink, population trends of affected native birds.
- Figure 2 illustrates the three-stage process: Stage 1 inventory of impacts → Stage 2 prioritisation and action definitions → Stage 3 definition of quantitative indicators.
- Example: invasive herbaceous species in Brazil demonstrates an active management decision space (monitoring, research, nutrient-cycle modification) and potential action types (do nothing, follow-up, investigation, active management).

## Appendix and materials
- Appendix includes an example impact inventory (Excel) with:
  - Sheet detailing the person completing the inventory and the invasive species evaluated.
  - Sheet with impact details (impact names in English in the original due to methodology origin).
  - Sheet with standardized impact lists and categories (in English).

## Implications for monitoring framework authors
- Emphasises designing monitoring frameworks around impacts and associated indicators rather than focusing solely on species.
- Leverages standardized methods (IUCN) to capture diverse stakeholder perspectives and ensure representativeness.
- Provides a tangible workflow and artifacts (inventory, prioritisation criteria, actionable indicators, and an Excel appendix) to support data collection, indicator development, and evaluation of management effectiveness to inform decision-making.
