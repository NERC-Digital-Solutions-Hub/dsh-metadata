# CONTAIN: Optimising the long-term management of invasive species affecting biodiversity and the rural economy using adaptive management Procedimientos para la priorización de impactos y acciones de gestión y manejo de especies exóticas invasoras*

## Context and Aim
- Invasive exotic species cause significant environmental, social, and economic impacts that can be both negative and positive.
- Management should consider both negative impacts and potential positive uses (e.g., resources for fishing/forestry), and focus on impacts rather than the species themselves.
- Management of invasive species that cannot be eradicated should aim to mitigate, minimize, or adapt to the impacts, prioritizing societal and community perspectives.

## Methodology and Process for Prioritization
- Invasive species management is complex and benefits from representative societal input; the CONTAIN project develops a process to identify and prioritize impacts and to determine appropriate actions.
- The process was implemented by 20 project members to address seven examples of invasive species management in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil.
- The process comprises three consecutive stages:

  - Stage 1: Inventory of impacts and affected resources using a standardized IUCN methodology, capturing magnitude, affected resources, and whether impacts are positive or negative. Ensure inventories reflect diverse societal perspectives (experts, managers, decision-makers, and affected communities). Appendix 1 contains an example; link to IUCN resources provided.
  - Stage 2: Prioritization of the catalogued impacts based on magnitude and uncertainty, and definition of the most appropriate type of action for each prioritized impact: (i) do nothing; (ii) monitor; (iii) further investigate; (iv) actively manage the impact.
  - Stage 3: Selection of indicators and quantitative measures to monitor and evaluate both impacts and the effectiveness of management actions.

## Examples and Indicators
- Table 1 presents two real examples from CONTAIN illustrating prioritization of impacts and associated quantitative indicators.

  - Pinos invasores en Chile (Invasive pines in Chile)
    - Impacts prioritized for active management: 1) modification of fire regime; 2) damage to agriculture; 3) altered hydrological characteristics, water purification, and soil moisture; 4) reduction of native biodiversity; 5) alteration of recreational and tourism uses.
    - Quantitative indicators: 1) fire load/combustible load; 2) biomass/primary productivity of herbaceous vegetation; 3) hydrological flow models; 4) presence and richness of exotic species; 5) human landscape preferences.

  - Visón americano en Argentina (American mink in Argentina)
    - Impacts prioritized for active management: 1) population decline; 2) modification of cultural, educational, aesthetic, religious, and ornamental values.
    - Quantitative indicators: 1) reproductive success of native bird species affected by the mink; 2) population trends of the affected native birds.

## Process Visualization
- Figure 2 outlines the three-stage process for prioritization and definition of management actions:
  - Etapa 1: Inventory of impacts and resources affected.
  - Etapa 2: Prioritization of impacts and definition of management actions.
  - Etapa 3: Definition of quantitative indicators.

## Appendix and Data Management
- Appendix presents an example inventory of impacts (Excel document) including:
  - Hoja 1: Details of the person completing the inventory and the evaluated invasive species.
  - Hoja 2: Details of the impacts (impact names provided in English in the original workbook).
  - Hoja 3: Standardized lists of impacts and categories (names in English).

## Data Considerations for Analysts
- The approach emphasizes integrating diverse societal viewpoints into data collection and prioritization.
- Uses a standardized framework (IUCN/EICAT) to catalogue impacts, enabling cross-country comparison and reproducibility.
- Outputs include prioritized impacts, recommended action types, and clearly defined quantitative indicators to monitor both impacts and management effectiveness.
- Data collection and prioritization are designed to be scalable across different geographic contexts (Argentina, Chile, Brazil) and adaptable to other invasive species management challenges.
