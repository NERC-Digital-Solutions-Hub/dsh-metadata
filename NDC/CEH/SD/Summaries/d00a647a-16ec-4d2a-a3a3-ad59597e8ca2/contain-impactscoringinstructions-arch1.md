# Impact scoring sheet

## Overview

- Purpose: A structured process to assess the impacts of invasive taxa using the EICAT framework, considering both reported and potential impacts and both positive and negative directions.
- Scope for analysts: Complete the scoring sheet individually, with time guidance of 2–3 hours, and consult designated contacts if needed.
- Key premise: Evaluate impacts assuming no management if management is not ongoing; if management exists, assess impacts that would occur without that management.
- Outputs: A scored dataset that can inform decisions and be used in reports, including clear conclusions and references.

## Data structure and workflow

- Excel workbook contains three sheets:
  - (i) Metadata & basic information
  - (ii) Impact scoring sheet (the main sheet to complete)
  - (iii) Lists (reference only; do not modify)
- Do not alter the third sheet; keep the Unique ID in metadata intact as your identifier.
- Primary task: Complete the first two sheets; the third sheet is for reference only.
- Time and process guidance:
  - Complete eight columns per entry in the impact scoring sheet.
  - Add one row per impact outcome and species/asset combination (duplicate outcomes for different species/assets as separate rows).
  - Hovered column tips provide specific instructions for each field.

## How to fill the impact scoring sheet

- Impact outcomes:
  - Select one category from the provided drop-down list.
  - There are overlapping outcomes; be specific (e.g., choose "species range change" rather than a broader "reduction in native biodiversity").
  - Add a new row for each unique outcome–species/asset pair.
  - Use the full list from the “lists” sheet (or page 3 of the document) as reference.
- Impact mechanism:
  - Select one mechanism from the drop-down list (refer to the lists for the full set).
- Maximum impact level (EICAT Category):
  - Select one category from the EICAT list (Data Deficient, Minimal Concern, Minor, Moderate, Major, Massive).
  - The decision tree on page 11 provides guidance for categorisation.
- Level of confidence:
  - Select High, Medium, or Low, with page 12 detailing the criteria.
- Species or asset impacted:
  - Write the affected species or asset name.
- Direction of the impact:
  - Indicate Positive or Negative.
- Comments and other details:
  - Provide any context, caveats, or clarifications relevant to the assessment.
- References and supporting information:
  - Include links or citations to sources (papers, reports, expert communications, etc.).

## Impact mechanisms

- Competition
- Predation
- Hybridisation
- Disease transmission
- Parasitism
- Poisoning/Toxicity
- Bio-fouling
- Grazing/Herbivory/Browsing
- Chemical, physical or structural impact on ecosystems (including changes to biotope characteristics, nutrient cycling, disturbance regimes, and natural succession)
- Interaction with other alien species

Note: The last category encompasses complex interactions and may include sub-dynamics such as facilitation or inhibition among multiple alien taxa.

## EICAT categories (definitions)

- Data Deficient (DD): Best evidence shows the taxon exists in the wild beyond its native range, but data are inadequate to classify impact, or insufficient time has passed since introduction for impacts to be apparent.
- Minimal Concern (MC): Impacts are unlikely to cause deleterious effects on native biota or abiotic environment; all aliens have some impact, but not at a level to warrant higher concern.
- Minor (MN): Impacts reduce fitness of native individuals but do not cause population declines or drive changes that would elevate to higher categories.
- Moderate (MO): Declines in native population sizes occur, with no changes to community structure or ecosystem composition.
- Major (MR): Local extinction of at least one native species occurs, with reversible changes in community structure or ecosystem composition; not extending to higher category.
- Massive (MV): Replacement/local extinction of native species with irreversible, fundamental changes to community structure and ecosystem composition.

- Important notes:
  - There is no category equivalent to “no impact”; all introduced taxa are assumed to have some impact.
  - Taxa evaluated under the EICAT process should be placed in Data Deficient if data on their impacts are insufficient after thorough review.

## Criteria and decision framework (high-level)

- A comprehensive table (Table 1 in the document) links each mechanism to EICAT categories, outlining criteria such as:
  - Irreversibility versus reversibility
  - Whether impacts affect community composition, population sizes, or individual fitness
  - Whether changes are observed locally or at broader scales
- The framework guides how to interpret different types of impact across mechanisms, including potential research gaps and the need for expert input.

## Level of confidence and decision support

- Confidence levels (High, Medium, Low) reflect:
  - Directness and quality of observational evidence
  - Appropriateness of the spatial scale of the data
  - Reliability and clarity of data sources
- A decision tree (Figure 2 in the document) assists in systematically applying the appropriate EICAT category based on the mechanism, observed effects, and reversibility.
