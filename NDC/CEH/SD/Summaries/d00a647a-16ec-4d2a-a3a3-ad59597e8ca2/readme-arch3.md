# Identifying priorities, targets, and actions for the long-term social and ecological management of invasive alien species

## Overview
- A study using expert elicitation to identify priorities, targets, and actions for long-term social and ecological management of invasive alien species (IAS).
- Seventeen experts across seven case studies completed Impact Score spreadsheets independently, following provided guidance.
- Two rounds of scoring were followed by a facilitated workshop (San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina, December 2019) to agree final impact scores.
- Preliminary evaluation of methods included sharing Impact Briefs with collaborators in Latin America.

## Data products and structure
- Compiled-Impact.csv
  - Contains results of expert elicitation for IAS impacts.
  - Rows correspond to individual impact outcomes; includes columns such as:
    - Impact.outcome
    - Impact.mechanism
    - Maximum.impact..EICAT.classification.level.
    - Level.of.confidence
    - Type (plant or animal)
    - Country
    - References.and.supporting.information
- Unique-Impact.csv
  - Deduplicated version of the impacts (no duplicates for the same impact outcome by species and country).
  - Columns include:
    - Impact.outcome
    - Impact.mechanim
    - Maximum.impact..EICAT.classification.level.
    - Level.of.confidence
    - Species.or.asset.impacted
    - Direction.of.the.impact
    - Area (km2)
    - Species
    - Type
    - Country
- The content notes that the final dataset reflects the consensus from expert evaluations (for each impact outcome, species, and country).

## Methods and guidance documents

## Accessibility and sharing
- Data are freely available.
- Supporting materials (scoring instructions and impact briefs) accompany the datasets to enable reproducibility and transparency.
- The study emphasizes sharing underlying data and ensuring traceability to publications and other information.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a structured approach to developing monitoring indicators for policy evaluation:
  - Use of standardized scoring templates to capture impact outcomes and mechanisms.
  - Ability to translate expert assessments into comparable datasets at the species, country, and area levels.
  - Deduplication to produce unique impact records for clearer synthesis across case studies.
  - Inclusion of metadata and references to support data quality and traceability.
  - Public sharing of data and supporting materials to aid transparency, governance, and future decision-making in IAS management.

## Practical considerations for authors of monitoring frameworks
- Adopt transparent scoring protocols (guidelines like CONTAIN-ImpactScoringInstructions.pdf) to ensure consistency.
- Capture both the magnitude/mechanism of impacts and the confidence in classifications (e.g., EICAT levels, language on direction of impact).
- Maintain high-quality metadata (area, country, species, type) to enable cross-case comparability.
- Plan for deduplication to avoid duplicative records and improve integrative analyses.
- Provide accessible data and supplementary materials to facilitate replication and stakeholder engagement.
