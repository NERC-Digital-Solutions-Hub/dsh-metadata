# Impact scoring sheet

## Purpose and scope
- Structured tool to evaluate the potential and observed impacts of species under different management scenarios (e.g., with or without management).
- Encourages consideration of both reported and potential impacts, across positive and negative directions.
- Supports consistency, transparency, and comparability in environmental impact assessments for policy and decision-making.

## Data structure and sheets
- Excel workbook contains three sheets:
  - Metadata & basic information
  - Impact scoring sheet (the main assessment tool)
  - Lists (reference; should not be modified)
- Instructions emphasize not changing the Unique ID field in metadata.
- The impact scoring sheet is the primary work zone, containing eight columns to complete (with hover-help for details).

## How to complete the impact scoring sheet
- Impact outcomes
  - Select one category per row from the predefined list; add a row for each species/asset impacted.
  - If multiple outcomes apply to the same species/asset, create separate rows with the same outcome but different species/asset names.
  - Refer to the lists sheet (or the document pages) for the complete list of outcomes.
- Impact mechanism
  - Choose one mechanism category per assessment (e.g., competition, predation, disease transmission, etc.).
- Maximum impact level (EICAT Category)
  - Choose from the EICAT category options (Data Deficient, Minimal Concern, Minor, Moderate, Major, Massive) with guidance on usage.
  - Categories come with specific criteria and a decision tree to aid classification.
- Level of confidence
  - Select High, Medium, or Low with defined likelihood guidelines and example scenarios.
- Species or asset impacted
  - Specify the native species or asset affected by the impact.
- Direction of the impact
  - Indicate whether the impact is positive or negative.
- Comments and other details
  - Add any relevant notes, caveats, or contextual information.
- References and supporting information
  - Include links or citations (papers, reports, expert communications, etc.) that inform the assessment.

## Impact mechanisms (examples)
- Competition
- Predation
- Hybridisation
- Disease transmission
- Parasitism
- Poisoning/Toxicity
- Bio-fouling
- Grazing/Herbivory/Browsing
- Chemical, physical or structural impact on ecosystems
- Interaction with other alien species

## EICAT categories (definitions)
- Data Deficient (DD): Evidence exists but is insufficient to classify; acknowledges potential impacts but uncertainty remains.
- Minimal Concern (MC): Likely limited or negligible impacts on native biota; still, alien taxa are not risk-free.
- Minor (MN): Reductions in fitness of native individuals but no declines in native population sizes.
- Moderate (MO): Declines in native population sizes, without changes to broader community structure.
- Major (MR): Local extinction or substantial disruption of community structure, without broader irreversible changes.
- Massive (MV): Replacement/local extinction of natives with irreversible changes to communities and ecosystems.
- Note: Even taxa not classified as MC may have some level of impact; all aliens have some impact, and “no impact” is not an allowable categorization in this framework.

## Data handling, governance, and guidance
- The scoring sheet emphasizes data transparency and sharing, while acknowledging potential barriers (e.g., metadata quality, access, and governance).
- Maintain clear documentation of data sources, quality, and any transformations applied.
- Data sharing and openness should be planned and implemented at the source to facilitate governance and reuse.
- The process includes guidance on how to communicate complex findings clearly and accessibly.

## Process notes and reminders
- Complete the impact scoring sheet individually; collaboration or sharing of responses is discouraged.
- Expect to spend roughly 2–3 hours on the task.
- Consider both observed (reported) and potential impacts, including scenarios where management is absent.
- If there are doubts or questions, contact the designated contacts provided in the document.
