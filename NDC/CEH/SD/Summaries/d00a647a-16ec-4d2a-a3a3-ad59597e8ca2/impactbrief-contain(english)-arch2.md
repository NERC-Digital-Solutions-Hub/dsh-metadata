# Methods for prioritisation of impacts and actions for the management of invasive alien species

## Overview
- Invasive alien species (IAS) cause diverse environmental, social, and economic impacts, which can be negative or positive.
- Management should be impact-based rather than species-based, aiming to mitigate negative impacts and recognise beneficial uses (e.g., resources for angling or forestry).
- Management must consider different societal perspectives and stakeholder interests.

## The CONTAIN three-stage process
- Stage 1: Catalogue impacts
  - Use IUCN-standardised methods to inventory impact outcomes, their magnitude, assets affected, and whether impacts are positive or negative.
  - Ensure inventories reflect the views of a broad range of stakeholders (experts, decision-makers, managers, affected communities).
  - Reference example inventories are provided in the Appendix.
- Stage 2: Prioritise impacts and decide on high-level actions
  - Prioritise based on magnitude and confidence.
  - Assign high-level actions for each prioritised impact: do nothing; monitor; research; actively manage.
- Stage 3: Define quantitative indicators
  - Develop indicators to measure the magnitude of impacts and to track progress of management actions.

## Case study highlights
- Grasses in Brazil
  - Demonstrates how stage-based actions (monitor, research, active management) can be linked to specific impact outcomes (e.g., changes in nutrient fluxes, food web modification, fire regime alteration, native biodiversity loss).
- Chile – Invasive pines
  - Priority impact outcomes include modification of fire regime, damage to agriculture, hydrological changes, biodiversity loss, and altered recreational use.
  - Quantitative measures example: fuel load, biomass/primary productivity, hydrological models, species richness, and landscape preferences.
- Argentina – American mink
  - Priority impacts include population size decline and impacts on cultural/educational/aesthetic values.
  - Quantitative measures example: breeding success of affected native birds and population trends of affected birds.

## Outputs and tools
- Appendix provides an example inventory of impacts (Excel spreadsheet) with:
  - Sheet 1: Assessor details and species evaluated
  - Sheet 2: Impacts information
  - Sheet 3: Lists of standardised impacts and categories

## Stakeholder engagement and societal perspectives
- The process emphasises incorporating broad societal viewpoints to ensure inventories are representative of various stakeholders, including scientists, decision-makers, managers, and affected communities.

## Data, monitoring, and analysis considerations for Analysts
- Alignment with standardized methods (IUCN) ensures consistency and comparability.
- Emphasis on data quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation.
- Outputs are designed as clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and datasets should be stored and accessible via appropriate data portals.
- Aims to increase the value of monitoring datasets by enabling data integration and broader access.

## Feedback and potential adoption
- A survey invites stakeholder feedback on novelty, usability, missing elements, potential usefulness, focus on impacts versus species, tools needed for implementation, and experience with similar systems.
- Questions also probe what would be required to adopt elements of the process (or the full process).

## Appendices
- Appendix includes an example of an inventory of impacts (Excel) with structured sheets to support implementation.
