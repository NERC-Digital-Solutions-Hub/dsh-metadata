# Methods and processes for the prioritisation of impacts and actions for the management of invasive alien species

## Context
- Invasive alien species cause important environmental, social, and economic impacts, which can be negative or positive.
- Management should consider both positive and negative impacts and focus on mitigating or adapting to negative impacts when eradication is not possible.
- Management should reflect different societal perspectives and interests of stakeholders.

## Process overview
- The CONTAIN project develops processes and methods to identify and prioritise impacts and determine actions for addressing them.
- The process has been applied by 20 people across seven invasive species case examples in Chile, Brazil, and Argentina.
- The process comprises three consecutive stages:
  1. Stage 1: Inventory impacts using IUCN standard methods, capturing magnitude, affected assets, and whether impacts are positive or negative; ensure stakeholder representativeness.
  2. Stage 2: Prioritise impacts by magnitude and confidence, and assign high-level actions: do nothing; monitor; research; actively manage.
  3. Stage 3: Specify quantitative indicators to measure impacts and track progress of management actions.

## Stage-by-stage detail
- Stage 1 – Catalogue impact outcomes, mechanisms, and assets
  - Create an inventory of impacts, their magnitude, impacted assets, their positive/negative nature, and information sources; aim to reflect views of experts, decision-makers, managers, and affected communities.
- Stage 2 – Prioritise impact outcomes and decide on high-level actions
  - Prioritise based on magnitude and confidence; select high-level actions for each prioritized impact.
- Stage 3 – Define quantitative indicators
  - Develop indicators to measure impact magnitude and monitor progress of interventions.

## Case studies and examples
- Grasses in Brazil
  - Demonstrates prioritised impact outcomes and associated quantitative indicators; examples include modifications to nutrient fluxes, food webs, fire regimes, and biodiversity.
- Invasive pines in Chile
  - Priority active-management outcomes include: modification of fire regime, damage to agriculture, alteration of hydrology/soil moisture, reduction in native biodiversity, and changes to recreational use.
  - Quantitative indicators cover: fuel load, biomass/primary productivity, hydrological models, species richness, and human landscape preferences.
- American mink in Argentina
  - Priority outcomes include: population size decline and change in cultural/educational/esthetic values.
  - Quantitative indicators include: breeding success of affected native birds and population trends.

## Survey and stakeholder engagement
- A survey seeks feedback on: novelty and clarity; unnecessary elements or missing pieces; usefulness for management; focus on impact-based management; needed tools and capabilities; and duration of involvement with the species.

## Data and governance implications for data leaders
- Uses standardised IUCN-based methods to ensure cross-case comparability.
- Captures key data dimensions: impact magnitude, mechanisms, assets affected, and data sources.
- Connects data collection to actionable governance through stage-based prioritisation and measurable indicators.
- Encourages stakeholder representation and collaborative data practices across regions.
