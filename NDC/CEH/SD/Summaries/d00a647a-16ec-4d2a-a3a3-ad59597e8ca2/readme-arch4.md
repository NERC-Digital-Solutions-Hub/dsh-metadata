# Identifying priorities, targets, and actions for the long-term social and ecological management of invasive alien species

## Overview
- Presents the outputs of an expert-elicitation exercise to identify priorities, targets, and actions for managing invasive alien species (IAS) over the long term.
- Data are intended to support assessments of IAS impacts and inform policy and management decisions.

## Data collection and workflow
- 17 experts across 7 case studies completed Impact Score spreadsheets independently following provided instructions.
- Two rounds of scoring were conducted.
- Results were discussed in a facilitated workshop in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina (December 2019).
- Final agreed impact scores are in Unique-Impact.csv.
- Preliminary evaluation of methods was shared with collaborators in Latin America via ImpactBrief documents (English and Spanish).

## Data files and contents
- Compiled-Impact.csv: Contains expert-elicited impact outcomes with fields including:
  - Impact.outcome, Impact.mechanism, Maximum.impact..EICAT.classification.level., Level.of.confidence, Type (plant or animal), Country, References and supporting information.
- Unique-Impact.csv: Deduplicated records (one impact outcome per species and country) with fields including:
  - Impact.outcome, Impact.mechanim, Maximum.impact..EICAT.classification.level., Level.of.confidence, Species.or.asset.impacted, Direction.of.the.impact (positive/negative), Area (km2), Species, Type, Country.
- CONTAIN-ImpactScoringInstructions.pdf: Instructions, lists, and guidance used to complete the impact scoring spreadsheets.
- ImpactBrief-CONTAIN(English).pdf and ImpactBrief-CONTAIN(Español).pdf: Briefs circulated to gather feedback on procedures (in English and Spanish).

## Data structure and metadata
- Data describe impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) and their mechanisms, categorized by EICAT level, with confidence ratings.
- Records link each impact to:
  - Species or asset affected, country, study area (Area in km2), and whether the IAS is a plant or animal.
- Includes references and supporting information for each evaluation.

## Data quality and validation
- A two-round scoring process followed by a workshop to reach consensus on final impact scores.
- Duplicates were removed to produce unique impact records per species and country.
- Documentation provided to support evaluation methods and allow external review (scoring instructions and briefings).

## Accessibility, reuse, and dissemination
- Data are described as freely available.
- Supporting documents (scoring instructions and impact briefs) are provided to facilitate understanding and reuse.
- Contact details for the lead author are provided for further information.

## Relevance for Data Leaders (data strategy and collaboration)
- Demonstrates end-to-end data workflow: expert elicitation, structured scoring, consensus-building, and deduplication to produce a usable IAS impact dataset.
- Highlights key data considerations:
  - Clear, consistent variables (outcomes, mechanisms, EICAT level, confidence, geographic scope, species, country).
  - Documentation and guidance to enable reproducibility (scoring instructions, briefing documents).
  - Open data approach with accessible outputs and supporting materials.
- Illustrates how to align data collection with user needs and policy relevance (priorities, targets, actions for long-term management).
- Points to broader data-system needs:
  - Standardization of impact terminology and metadata to facilitate cross-study comparability.
  - Transparent provenance and references to support data credibility.
  - Availability of deduplicated, country- and species-specific records to identify gaps and inform targeted actions.
