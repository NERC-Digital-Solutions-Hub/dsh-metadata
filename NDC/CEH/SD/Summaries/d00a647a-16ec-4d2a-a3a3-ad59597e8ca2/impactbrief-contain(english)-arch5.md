# Methods and processes for the prioritisation of impacts and actions for the management of invasive alien species

## Overview
- The CONTAIN project provides a three-stage, impact-based approach to prioritise the effects of invasive alien species (IAS) and to define actionable management responses.
- Emphasises representing a wide range of societal perspectives (experts, decision-makers, managers, affected communities).
- Uses standardised data practices to inventory impacts, assess their significance, and develop quantitative indicators for monitoring progress.
- Demonstrates application with case studies in Chile, Brazil, and Argentina and includes stakeholder feedback and data-structure guidance.

## Methodology at a glance
- Three consecutive stages to identify, prioritise, and measure IAS impacts and actions.
  - Stage 1: Catalogue impact outcomes, mechanisms, and assets using standard methods; capture both positive and negative impacts; ensure stakeholder representation; document sources.
  - Stage 2: Prioritise impacts by magnitude and confidence; assign high-level actions for each prioritised impact (do nothing; monitor; research; actively manage).
  - Stage 3: Specify quantitative indicators to measure the impacts and track management progress.

## Stage 1 – Catalogue impacts
- Inventory impacts, their outcomes, underlying mechanisms, and affected assets.
- Classify impacts as positive or negative.
- Ensure inventories reflect diverse stakeholder views (experts, policymakers, managers, affected communities).
- Information sources and data provenance are important for transparency.

## Stage 2 – Prioritisation and high-level actions
- Prioritise based on impact magnitude and confidence in evidence.
- Assign high-level management actions per prioritised impact:
  - Do nothing
  - Monitor
  - Research
  - Actively manage

## Stage 3 – Indicators for measurement
- Develop quantitative indicators to quantify impact magnitude and to monitor progress of management actions.
- Indicators can cover ecological, social, economic, and governance aspects (e.g., nutrient flux changes, biodiversity metrics, hydrological models, human landscape preferences).

## Data and indicators in practice (examples)
- Example impact outcomes prioritised for active management include:
  - Modification of fire regime
  - Damage to agriculture
  - Changes to hydrology and water quality
  - Reduction in native biodiversity
  - Alteration of recreational use and tourism
- Corresponding quantitative measures include:
  - Fuel load, biomass/primary productivity
  - Hydrological models and water flow metrics
  - Species richness and presence of alien species
  - Human preferences for landscapes
- Case examples from the study:
  - Invasive pines in Chile: indicators linked to fire risk, biomass, hydrology, biodiversity, and landscape preferences.
  - American mink in Argentina: indicators include population trends and breeding success of affected native birds.

## Case study: Grasses in Brazil
- Demonstrates application of the three-stage process with real-world data and indicators.
- Includes explicit prioritisation outcomes and the associated quantitative indicators used to monitor progress.

## Stakeholder survey and feedback
- Aimed to gather opinions on process usefulness, clarity, completeness, and potential adoption.
- Key questions cover novelty, ease of use, missing elements, usefulness for management, focus on impact-based versus species-based management, required tools and capabilities, and prior experience with the species/system.

## Data structures and documentation (Appendix)
- Example inventory layout provided as an Excel workbook:
  - Sheet 1: Assessor details and information about the IAS
  - Sheet 2: Impacts and their characteristics
  - Sheet 3: Lists of standardised impacts and categories
- Emphasises the need for structured, interoperable data formats to support sharing and comparison across cases and regions.

## Implications for Data Stewards
- Standardisation and interoperability are essential:
  - Adopt or adapt standard inventories (e.g., IUCN-based methods) to ensure consistency across datasets and regions.
  - Maintain clear metadata and data provenance to support reuse and auditing.
- Data governance considerations:
  - Capture diverse stakeholder inputs to avoid biased inventories.
  - Design data models that accommodate both qualitative assessments (impact categories) and quantitative indicators.
  - Plan for ongoing updates as new data become available; ensure version control and traceability.
- Data access and sharing:
  - Facilitate data upload to relevant portals and catalogues to support discovery and collaboration.
  - Document data collection methods and indicators to enable reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
- Challenges to prepare for:
  - Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities.
  - Timely data acquisition from multiple authors and systems.
  - Harmonising data from many different formats and legacy databases.
  - Handling large datasets and ensuring data quality across diverse contexts.
