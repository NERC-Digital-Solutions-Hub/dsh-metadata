# Impact scoring sheet

- Purpose: A structured, time-bound process to assess the ecological impacts of species (invasive or otherwise) using a standardised scoring framework (EICAT) to support consistent reporting of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Audience: Practitioners responsible for completing impact assessments, ensuring data quality, and communicating risks and impacts to stakeholders.

## How to use

- Before starting, read the list of potential impact outcomes (refer to page 3).
- Complete the impact scoring sheet yourself; do not share or discuss it with others.
- Allocate about 2–3 hours to complete the scoring sheet.
- Evaluate impacts under scenarios both with and without management:
  - If there is no ongoing management, focus on impacts that would occur without management.
  - If management exists, assess potential impacts that would occur in the absence of management.
- Consider both reported and potential impacts, and both positive and negative directions.
- Return the completed sheet when finished.
- For questions, contact Pablo Diaz (pablo.garciadiaz@abdn.ac.uk) and copy Euan Phimister (e.phimister@abdn.ac.uk).

## Dataset structure and governance

- The Excel dataset contains three sheets:
  - (i) Metadata & basic information
  - (ii) Impact scoring sheet (main worksheet)
  - (iii) Lists (reference only; do not modify)
- Do not modify the third sheet (Lists).
- Do not change the 'Unique ID' in the metadata sheet; it is a unique identifier assigned by the dataset creator.
- The impact scoring sheet comprises eight columns to complete; hover in each column for on-screen instructions.

## Impact scoring sheet: fields and workflow

- Impact outcomes: Select one category from the dropdown. If multiple categories could apply, be specific (e.g., choose "species range change" over "reduction in native biodiversity"). Add one row per outcome/species/asset combination.
- Impact mechanism: Select one category from the dropdown (see Lists for options).
- Maximum impact level (EICAT Category): Select from the EICAT category dropdown (see categories and guidance in the document; refer to pages 5–11 and the decision tree on page 11).
- Level of confidence: Select from the dropdown (High, Medium, Low) with the definitions on page 12.
- Species or asset impacted: Specify the affected species or asset.
- Direction of the impact: Indicate Positive or Negative.
- Comments and other details: Include any relevant notes or discussion points.
- References and supporting information: Provide links or citations to sources (papers, reports, communications, etc.).

## Impact mechanisms

- Competition
- Predation
- Hybridisation
- Disease transmission
- Parasitism
- Poisoning/Toxicity
- Bio-fouling
- Grazing/Herbivory/Browsing
- Chemical, physical or structural impact on ecosystem
- Interaction with other invasive species

## EICAT categories (definitions and application)

- Data Deficient (DD)
- Minimal Concern (MC)
- Minor (MN)
- Moderate (MO)
- Major (MR)
- Massive (MV)

Notes:
- Minimal Concern means unlikely to cause deleterious impacts on native biota, but all aliens have some impact; use MC only when adequate studies exist and show low impact. If not enough information, classify as DD.
- The table and definitions provide guidance on assigning categories based on observed or inferred impacts across mechanisms.
- The document includes a detailed table (Table 1) outlining impact criteria by mechanism and category, to help distinguish among levels (e.g., replacement, local extinction, population declines, or effects on fitness), as well as guidance for irreversible vs. reversible changes.

## Level of confidence

- High: Direct, relevant observational evidence; impacts observed at the typical spatial scale; high-quality data sources; straightforward interpretation; no contradictions.
- Medium: Some observational evidence; some inference; spatial scale may be broader or narrower; some uncertainty but reliable extrapolation/ downscaling possible.
- Low: No direct observational evidence; relies on inference or extrapolation; data quality or interpretation is uncertain or controversial.

- The confidence level may include considerations for potential impacts (i.e., not only observed impacts).

## Practical notes for Analysts Monitoring the Environment

- When multiple outcomes apply to the same species/asset, create separate rows for each outcome/species/asset combination.
- Document both observed impacts and potential impacts informed by literature or analogous situations.
- Clearly separate positive and negative impacts in the direction field.
- Collect and attach credible references to support each assessment; ensure traceability of data sources.
- Use the Lists sheet as the canonical reference for impact outcomes, mechanisms, and EICAT categories.

## Alignment with environmental monitoring aims

- The scoring sheet provides a standardised, transparent method to quantify and document environmental impacts over time.
- Outputs support consistent reporting in environmental health assessments and policy performance evaluations, including downstream formats such as reports, maps, and dashboards.
