# Impact scoring sheet

## Purpose and scope
- Guidance for completing an impact scoring sheet that assesses the effects of invasive alien taxa using the EICAT framework.
- Aims to capture both reported and potential impacts, positive and negative, under a standardized data structure.
- Each row represents one impact outcome for a specific species/asset combination.

## Structure and sheets
- The provided Excel dataset contains three sheets:
  - Metadata & basic information
  - Impact scoring sheet (the main worksheet to fill out)
  - Lists (reference only; do not modify)
- Do not change the third sheet (Lists).
- Do not modify the Unique ID in the Metadata sheet; it uniquely identifies entries.

## Impact scoring sheet: eight columns
- Impact outcomes: select one category from the drop-down; create a separate row for each outcome/species combination; be specific when overlapping categories.
- Impact mechanism: select one mechanism category from the drop-down.
- Maximum impact level (EICAT Category): select from the EICAT categories (Data Deficient, Minimal Concern, Minor, Moderate, Major, Massive).
- Level of confidence: select from the defined confidence levels (High, Medium, Low).
- Species or asset impacted: name the native species or asset affected.
- Direction of the impact: indicate positive or negative impact.
- Comments and other details: provide any additional notes or discussion.
- References and supporting information: include links or sources (papers, reports, correspondence, etc.).

## How to complete the workbook
- Preparation: read the list of impact outcomes (referred to as page 3 in the document) and the Lists sheet for options.
- Time allocation: 2-3 hours recommended for completing the impact scoring sheet.
- Scoping: evaluate impacts under scenarios with and without management where applicable.
- Data considerations: include both observed/reported impacts and potential impacts inferred from other evidence; document both positive and negative effects.
- Row-level entries: add one row per impact outcome and species/asset combination; if the same outcome applies to multiple species, add separate rows for each species.
- Data sources: provide references and supporting information for each assessment.
- Collaboration: complete the scoring sheet individually; contact designated contacts if needed (Pablo and Euan in the example).

## Impact mechanisms
- Competition
- Predation
- Hybridisation
- Disease transmission
- Parasitism
- Poisoning/Toxicity
- Bio-fouling
- Grazing/Herbivory/Browsing
- Chemical, physical or structural impact on ecosystems
- Interaction with other alien species

## EICAT categories and criteria
- Data Deficient (DD)
- Minimal Concern (MC)
- Minor (MN)
- Moderate (MO)
- Major (MR)
- Massive (MV)

Notes:
- All introduced taxa have some level of impact; there is no category for “no impact.”
- For taxa evaluated under EICAT but not yet assessed, do not place them in Minimal Concern; classify as Data Deficient.
- The document includes a detailed table (Table 1) outlining impact criteria by mechanism and category (1–8 levels) to guide classification.
- A decision tree (Figure 2) provides guidance on applying the EICAT categories.

## Level of confidence
- Modified from Hawkins et al. 2015 to include potential impacts.
- High: strong direct observational evidence, standard spatial scale, high-quality sources, straightforward interpretation.
- Medium: some direct evidence but with some inferences or uncertain scale.
- Low: little or indirect evidence, questionable data quality or interpretation.

## References and supporting information
- Core reference: Hawkins et al. 2015 (Diversity and Distributions) and the supplementary material detailing categories and mechanisms.
- The workbook references pages and figures (e.g., lists of outcomes, mechanisms, the decision tree) for additional guidance.

## Data management notes for data support
- Use consistent terminology and the drop-down lists to ensure harmonized data entry.
- Include sufficient supporting information to enable future analysis and reproducibility.
- Ensure that all entries are traceable to sources and that the unique ID remains unchanged for data integrity.
