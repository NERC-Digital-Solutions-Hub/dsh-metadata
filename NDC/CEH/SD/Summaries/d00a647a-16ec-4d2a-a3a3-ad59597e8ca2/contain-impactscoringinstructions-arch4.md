# Impact scoring sheet

- Purpose: Structured instructions for completing an impact scoring sheet to assess invasive species impacts using the EICAT framework.

## Overview of the process

- Read the list of potential impact outcomes before scoring (refer to page 3 in the guide).
- Complete the scoring sheet by yourself; no sharing of your responses.
- Estimated time: 2–3 hours.
- Assess impacts under two scenarios: with management and without management; focus on impacts that would occur if management did not exist.
- Consider both reported and potential impacts, and both positive and negative directions.
- Return the completed sheet when finished.
- If questions arise, contact Pablo Diaz Diaz (and copy Euan Phimister).

## Data structure and governance

- Excel workbook contains three sheets:
  - Metadata & basic information: enter basic details; do not change the Unique ID (your assigned identifier).
  - Impact scoring sheet: main data entry sheet.
  - Lists: reference only; do not modify.
- Do not modify the third (Lists) sheet.
- Use the eight columns on the impact scoring sheet; each column provides guidance via hover tips.

## How to fill the impact scoring sheet

- Impact outcomes: select one category from a drop-down list; add one row per outcome and per species/asset combination. If the same outcome affects multiple native species, add separate rows with the same outcome but different species/assets.
- Impact mechanism: select one mechanism from a drop-down list (e.g., Competition, Predation, Hybridisation, Disease transmission, Parasitism, Poisoning/Toxicity, Bio-fouling, Grazing/Herbivory/Browsing, Chemical/physical/structural, Interaction with other alien species).
- Maximum impact level (EICAT Category): select from the predefined categories (Data Deficient, Minimal Concern, Minor, Moderate, Major, Massive) as described in the guidance.
- Level of confidence: choose High, Medium, or Low with the accompanying definitions in the guide.
- Species or asset impacted: specify the affected species or asset.
- Direction of the impact: indicate Positive or Negative.
- Comments and other details: provide any additional context.
- References and supporting information: include links or sources (papers, reports, consultations, etc.).

## Taxonomy and scales

- Impact outcomes: a comprehensive list of potential outcomes that may overlap; choose the most specific category when possible.
- EICAT categories: defined to reflect severity of impact on native biota and ecosystems (ranging from Data Deficient to Massive).
  - Data Deficient: insufficient information to assess impact level.
  - Minimal Concern: unlikely to cause deleterious impacts; not the same as “no impact.”
  - Minor to Massive: range of impacts from reducing fitness to causing local/global extinctions.
- Impact mechanisms: listed options include Competition, Predation, Hybridisation, Disease transmission, Parasitism, Poisoning/Toxicity, Bio-fouling, Grazing/Herbivory/Browsing, Chemical/physical/structural biotope change, and Interaction with other alien species.
- Decision framework: a decision tree (Figure 2 in the guide) guides how to apply EICAT categories consistently.

## Data quality and consistency

- Use the controlled vocabulary from the Lists sheet to ensure interoperability and discoverability.
- Capture both reported and potential impacts, and consider both positive and negative directions.
- Maintain clear metadata (Unique ID and basic details) to support traceability and auditing.
- The Guidelines emphasize avoiding data modification of the Lists sheet and ensuring entries reflect evidence quality and scale.

## Practical considerations for Data Leaders

- Aligns with a system-wide view of data: manage data assets with attention to format, quality, metadata, discoverability, and updates.
- Encourage co-ownership and user-centered feedback around data products.
- Identify data gaps, assess data availability, and document data sources and supporting information for governance and future reuse.
- Use standardized classifications to enable cross-partner comparisons and collaboration within a wider data community.
