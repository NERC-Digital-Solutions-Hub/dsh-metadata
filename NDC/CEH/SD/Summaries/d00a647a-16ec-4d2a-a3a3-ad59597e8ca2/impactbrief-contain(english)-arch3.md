# Methods and processes for the prioritisation of impacts and actions for the management of invasive alien species

## Context and aims
- Invasive alien species (IAS) cause significant environmental, social, and economic impacts, which can be negative or positive.
- Management should be impact-based (focusing on impacts and outcomes) rather than species-based, and consider diverse societal perspectives.
- The CONTAIN project develops methods to identify and prioritise IAS impacts and determine actions, ensuring representation from experts, decision-makers, managers, and affected communities.

## Process overview (three stages)
- Stage 1: Catalogue impact outcomes, mechanisms, and assets
  - Use standardized IUCN methods to inventory impacts, their magnitude, affected assets, and information sources.
  - Ensure inventories reflect broad stakeholder views (experts, policymakers, managers, communities).
  - Appendix provides an example inventory framework.
- Stage 2: Prioritise impacts and decide on high-level actions
  - Rank impacts by magnitude and confidence.
  - Assign high-level actions for each prioritized impact: do nothing; monitor; research; actively manage.
- Stage 3: Define quantitative indicators
  - Specify indicators to measure impact magnitude and track progress of management actions.

## Case studies and examples (CONTAIN project)
- Case studies conducted across seven IAS in Chile, Brazil, and Argentina, with involvement from about 20 project participants.
- Two examples of prioritized impacts and indicators:
  - Invasive pines in Chile
    - Active management priorities: modification of fire regime, damage to agriculture, modification of hydrology/ water quality, reduction in native biodiversity, alteration of recreational use and tourism.
    - Quantitative indicators: fuel load; biomass/primary productivity of grass; hydrological flow model; species richness and presence of alien species; human landscape preferences.
  - American mink in Argentina
    - Active management priorities: population size decline; modification of cultural/educational/aesthetic/ornamental values.
    - Quantitative indicators: breeding success of affected native birds; population trends of affected native birds.
- The process supports translating prioritized impacts into measurable indicators to monitor progress.

## Survey and stakeholder input
- A survey seeks feedback on the process’s novelty, clarity, necessity, and usefulness, and whether a shift to impact-based management is appropriate.
- Questions cover practical adoption needs, potential tools, and the user’s experience with the species/system.

## Appendices and practical tools
- Appendix includes an example inventory of impacts (Excel spreadsheet) with:
  - Sheet detailing assessors and IAS
  - Sheets for impact information and standardized impact categories
- The approach provides a structured, replicable framework for documenting and analyzing IAS impacts and actions.

## Relevance for monitoring framework authors
- Aligns with an impact-based monitoring approach, emphasizing stakeholder engagement, data provenance, and transparent indicators.
- Demonstrates a standardized method (IUCN-based inventory) and a clear path from impact identification to action planning and measurable outcomes.
- Highlights data and governance considerations:
  - Need for representative data and stakeholder input to avoid bias.
  - Importance of defining and sharing underlying data and metadata.
  - Demand for clear, accessible outputs (reports, charts, dashboards) and ongoing data management to keep indicators current.
- Acknowledges practical challenges common to monitoring frameworks:
  - Data availability and access issues
  - Data silos across organisations
  - Metadata quality and data transformation requirements
  - Communicating complex findings effectively
  - Establishing governance to ensure data quality, storage, sharing, and up-to-date status
