# CONTAIN: Optimising the long-term management of invasive species affecting biodiversity and the rural economy using adaptive management
Procedimientos para la priorización de impactos y acciones de gestión y manejo de especies exóticas invasoras

## Objective and scope
- Present a standardized process to identify and prioritise the impacts of invasive exotic species and determine actions to manage those impacts.
- Demonstrates the approach through 20 project-associated participants and seven management examples across Argentina, Chile, and Brazil within the CONTAIN project.
- Emphasises managing impacts (positive and negative) rather than focusing solely on the species; considers diverse societal perspectives.

## Context and guiding principles
- Invasive species cause environmental, social, and economic impacts, which can be harmful or beneficial.
- Management should account for both positive and negative impacts and prioritize reducing or adapting to negative impacts where eradication is not feasible.
- Incorporates multiple stakeholder perspectives (experts, managers, decision-makers, affected communities) to ensure representativeness.
- Data and results should support long-term adaptive management and informed decision-making across different systems and formats.

## Methodology and process (three-stage framework)
- Stage 1: Inventory of impacts and affected resources using a standardized IUCN methodology, capturing magnitude, affected resources, and whether impacts are positive or negative; ensure representation of stakeholders’ perspectives.
- Stage 2: Prioritization of impacts by magnitude and uncertainty and determination of appropriate actions for each prioritized impact:
  - No action
  - Monitoring
  - Additional research
  - Active management
- Stage 3: Definition of quantitative indicators and measures to assess both the impacts and the effectiveness of management actions.
- The process is designed to be applied iteratively and to support decision-making across varied contexts and governance settings.

## Data products and indicators
- Inventory outputs identify impacts, resources affected, magnitude, and direction (positive/negative), with sources of information.
- Prioritized impacts guide actionable decisions and resource allocation.
- Indicators and quantitative measures are defined to monitor impacts and evaluate management outcomes.
- The methodology provides a framework to translate qualitative assessments into measurable metrics.

## Examples and outputs (Table 1 highlights)
- Pine invasives in Chile:
  - Prioritized impacts for active management: changes in fire regime, damages to agriculture, hydrological and soil moisture changes, reduction in native biodiversity, alterations in recreational and tourism uses.
  - Quantitative indicators: fuel load, biomass/primary productivity of herbaceous plants, hydrological flow models, presence and richness of exotic species, human landscape preferences.
- American mink in Argentina:
  - Prioritized impacts for active management: population decline and changes in cultural, educational, aesthetic, ornamental values.
  - Quantitative indicators: reproductive success of native birds affected by mink, population trends of affected native birds.
- These examples illustrate the application of the process and the types of indicators that can be used to monitor and manage impacts.

## Process visualization
- Stage 1: Inventory of impacts and resources affected.
- Stage 2: Prioritization of impacts and definition of management actions.
- Stage 3: Definition of quantitative indicators.

## Appendices and data sources
- Appendix includes an example inventory (Excel document) with:
  - Sheet 1: Details of the person completing the inventory and the evaluated invasive species.
  - Sheet 2: Details of the impacts (impact names in English to reflect the original language of the work).
  - Sheet 3: Standardized listings of impacts and categories.

## Data stewardship and governance implications for data stewards
- Standardisation: Uses a standardized impact inventory framework (IUCN/EICAT) to ensure consistency across cases and countries.
- Metadata and provenance: Inventory documents who completed the assessment and links impacts to sources; maintain traceability of data inputs and decisions.
- Representativeness and inclusivity: Ensure inventories reflect diverse societal perspectives (experts, managers, decision-makers, communities) as emphasized in Stage 1 guidance.
- Interoperability and formats: The primary data artifact is an Excel inventory with multiple sheets; consider exporting to interoperable formats and maintaining a data dictionary to support reuse by portals and researchers.
- Multinational and multilingual considerations: Documents impacts and indicators across Argentina, Chile, Brazil; reflect that some impact names are retained in English in the inventory, which has implications for metadata curation and user interpretation.
- Data quality and updates: The process supports iterative refinement; establish update mechanisms for new data, new impacts, or revised indicators, and document uncertainties.
- Accessibility and sharing: Consider data-sharing constraints, sources, and embargo considerations; prepare data for portal hosting and discoverability while respecting any usage restrictions.
- Traceability of indicators: Clearly define indicators and measurement methods to enable consistent evaluation of management outcomes over time.

## Endnotes
- The document demonstrates a practical, collaborative framework for prioritising invasive species impacts and aligning management actions with measurable outcomes, using international standards and cross-country case studies.
