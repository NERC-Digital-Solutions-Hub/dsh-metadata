# Methods and processes for the prioritisation of impacts and actions for the management of invasive alien species

## Overview
- Focus: Develop and evaluate methods to identify and prioritise the impacts of invasive alien species and determine actions to address them.
- Rationale: Management should be impact-based, considering both positive and negative impacts and the diverse perspectives of society and stakeholders.
- Scope: Applied within the CONTAIN project across seven case studies in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, involving about 20 people.
- Outputs: A three-stage process to catalogue impacts, prioritise them, and define quantitative indicators; provides structured data for decision-making and monitoring.

## Three-stage process for prioritisation and action
- Stage 1: Catalogue impact outcomes, mechanisms, and assets
  - Use standardized methods (IUCN) to inventory impacts, their magnitude, affected assets, whether impacts are positive or negative, and information sources.
  - Ensure inventories reflect views from experts, decision-makers, managers, and affected communities.
  - Reference example inventories in appendices and IUCN resources.
- Stage 2: Prioritise impact outcomes and decide on high-level actions
  - Prioritise based on magnitude and confidence.
  - Assign high-level actions for each prioritized impact: do nothing; monitor; research; actively manage.
- Stage 3: Define quantitative indicators
  - Specify indicators to measure impact magnitude and track progress of management actions.

## Key components and outputs
- Standardized impact inventory
  - Catalogues impacts, outcomes, mechanisms, assets, and information sources.
- Prioritised impacts with high-level actions
  - A clear list of what to address and how (monitoring, research, active management, etc.).
- Quantitative indicators
  - Measurable metrics to assess impact magnitude and action effectiveness over time.
- International framework reference
  - Utilises IUCN standards for inventories and impact assessment (e.g., EICAT magnitude categories).
- Case study example: Grasses in Brazil
  - Demonstrates application of the process to real-world impacts and management choices.

## Case study highlights: Grasses in Brazil
- Stage 2 outcomes mapped to potential actions (e.g., monitor vs. active management) across multiple impact components.
- Illustrative emphasis on integrating ecological mechanisms (nutrient fluxes, food webs, fire regime) with management choices.

## Examples of prioritized impacts and indicators (Table 1 concept)
- Invasive pines in Chile
  - Prioritized impact outcomes for active management: modification of fire regime, damage to agriculture, modification of hydrology/ water quality, reduction in native biodiversity, alteration of recreational use and tourism.
  - Quantitative indicators: fuel load; biomass/primary productivity; hydrological model outputs; species richness and presence of alien species; human landscape preferences.
- American mink in Argentina
  - Prioritized impact outcomes for active management: population size decline; modification of cultural, educational, aesthetic, and ornamental values.
  - Quantitative indicators: breeding success of affected native birds; population trends of affected native birds.

## Stakeholder feedback and adoption (Survey)
- Targets: gather opinions on whether the process is interesting, easy to follow, missing elements, usefulness, and potential adoption.
- Key questions: usefulness of the process, missing components, usefulness for management, whether impact-based approach is preferred, tools needed for implementation, and experience with the species/system.

## Data and outputs (Appendix)
- Inventory structure (Excel spreadsheet)
  - Sheet 1: Assessor details and invasive alien species information.
  - Sheet 2: Impacts information.
  - Sheet 3: Standardised impacts and categories.

## Implications for data support
- Provides a structured, standardized data workflow to capture, consolidate, and analyse impact information from diverse sources.
- Supports data-driven decision-making with clearly defined indicators and actions.
- Enables representation of multiple stakeholder perspectives in data inventories.
- Facilitates monitoring and reporting through defined indicators and case-study exemplars.
- Data outputs (inventories, indicators, and experimental prototypes) can be shared and iterated with end-users to promote uptake and re-use.
