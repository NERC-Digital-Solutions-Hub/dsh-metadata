# CONTAIN: Optimising the long-term management of invasive species affecting biodiversity and the rural economy using adaptive management Procedimientos para la priorización de impactos y acciones de gestión y manejo de especies exóticas invasoras*

- Context and rationale
  - Invasive exotic species cause significant environmental, social, and economic impacts, which can be negative or positive.
  - Management should consider both positive and negative impacts and focus on impacts rather than the species themselves.
  - Management of non-eradicable invasives should aim to mitigate, minimize, or adapt to negative impacts and incorporate diverse societal perspectives.

- Methodology and process for prioritizing impacts and management actions
  - The CONTAIN project developed a three-stage process to identify and prioritize impacts and determine appropriate management actions, applied by 20 project participants across seven case examples in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil.
  - Stage 1: Inventory of impacts and affected resources using the standardized IUCN methodology (EICAT), capturing magnitude, affected resources, and whether impacts are positive or negative; ensure representation of stakeholder perspectives (experts, managers, decision-makers, affected communities). Appendix 1 provides an example; link to IUCN: www.iucn.org.
  - Stage 2: Prioritize impacts based on magnitude and uncertainty and define the type of action for each prioritized impact (no action, monitoring, additional research, active management).
  - Stage 3: Define quantitative indicators and measures to assess both the impacts and the effectiveness of management.
  
- Examples of prioritized impacts and quantitative indicators
  - Pine invasives in Chile
    - Prioritized impacts for active management: 1) modification of fire regime, 2) damage to agriculture, 3) alteration of hydrological characteristics and water quality/soil moisture, 4) reduction of native biodiversity, 5) alteration of recreational and tourism uses.
    - Quantitative indicators: 1) fire load/fuel load, 2) biomass/primary productivity of herbaceous communities, 3) hydrological flow models, 4) presence and richness of exotic species, 5) human landscape preferences.
  - American mink in Argentina
    - Prioritized impacts for active management: 1) population decline, 2) modification of cultural, educational, aesthetic, ornamental values.
    - Quantitative indicators: 1) breeding success of native bird species affected, 2) population trends of affected native birds.

- Process visualization
  - The documented process uses a three-stage sequence: Stage 1 inventory of impacts, Stage 2 prioritization and action definition, Stage 3 definition of quantitative indicators (illustrated in the referenced figure).

- Appendix and data artifacts
  - Appendix includes an example inventory of impacts (Excel workbook) with:
    - Sheet detailing the person completing the inventory and the evaluated invasive species.
    - Sheet with impact details (English names used for consistency).
    - Sheet with standardized impact lists and categories.
  
- Scope and data use
  - Part of the CONTAIN project, applied to seven management examples in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil.
  - Aims to produce representative, data-driven prioritizations and indicators to support adaptive management and decision-making, incorporating multiple data sources and stakeholder perspectives.
