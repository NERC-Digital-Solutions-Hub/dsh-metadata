# Impact scoring sheet for invasive species (EICAT) – General and Specific Instructions

- Overview
  - Purpose: evaluate impacts of invasive species using the EICAT framework, considering both reported and potential impacts.
  - Approach: assess impacts under no-management scenarios, include positive and negative directions, and create a separate row for each impact outcome and species/asset combination.
  - Time and privacy: complete the scoring sheet yourself (2–3 hours recommended) and do not share it; contact Pablo Garcia Diaz or Euan Phimister with questions.

- Structure of the dataset
  - Excel workbook contains three sheets: (i) metadata & basic information; (ii) impact scoring sheet; (iii) lists (for reference only; do not modify).
  - Do not modify the third sheet (lists).
  - Metadata sheet: fill basic details and do not change the Unique ID.
  - Impact scoring sheet: main sheet to complete, eight columns, with in-sheet guidance accessible via hover.

- Field definitions (eight columns)
  - Impact outcomes: select one category from the drop-down list; can be multiple outcomes across multiple rows; be specific (e.g., choose 'species range change' rather than 'reduction in native biodiversity').
  - Impact mechanism: select one mechanism from the drop-down list.
  - Maximum impact level (EICAT Category): select one category from the drop-down; refer to accompanying materials for details and a decision tree.
  - Level of confidence: select High, Medium, or Low with documented criteria.
  - Species or asset impacted: specify the affected species or asset.
  - Direction of the impact: indicate Positive or Negative.
  - Comments and other details: add any relevant notes.
  - References and supporting information: provide links or sources (papers, reports, etc.).

- How to apply impact entries
  - Add one row per impact outcome and species/asset combination.
  - If the same outcome affects multiple native species, create separate rows for each species with the same outcome.

- Impact mechanisms
  - Competition
  - Predation
  - Hybridisation
  - Disease transmission
  - Parasitism
  - Poisoning/Toxicity
  - Bio-fouling
  - Grazing/Herbivory/Browsing
  - Chemical, physical or structural impact on ecosystems
  - Interaction with other alien species

- EICAT categories (with brief definitions in the accompanying materials)
  - Data Deficient (DD)
  - Minimal Concern (MC)
  - Minor (MN)
  - Moderate (MO)
  - Major (MR)
  - Massive (MV)

- Key descriptions (for reference)
  - MC: unlikely to have deleterious impacts on native biota; all aliens have some impact, but none are truly negligible.
  - MN: reduces fitness of natives but not population sizes; no higher-category impacts.
  - MO: declines in native population size but not ecosystem structure.
  - MR: local/native extinction of at least one native species; reversible community changes upon removal.
  - MV: replacement/local extinction with irreversible changes in community and ecosystem structure.
  - DD: insufficient information to assign an impact category.

- Level of confidence
  - High: direct, relevant observational evidence; impacts observed at appropriate spatial scale; high-quality sources; straightforward interpretation.
  - Medium: some direct evidence with some inference; extrapolation or downscaling considered reliable; moderate ambiguity.
  - Low: little or inferred evidence; data are uncertain or of low quality.

- Decision framework
  - A decision tree is provided to guide category assignment (Figure 2; referenced but not reproduced here).

- GIS and data considerations for specialists
  - The scoring process supports map-based visualization of impacts; align rows with spatial features and attributes.
  - Maintain a consistent Unique ID to connect metadata, scoring entries, and spatial data.
  - Expect data to come from multiple sources and resolutions; plan for cleaning, transformation, and integration.
  - Engage end-users during development to ensure the outputs are suitable for policies, clients, or public visualization.
  - Attach references and supporting information to strengthen map-based interpretations.
