# Methods and processes for the prioritisation of impacts and actions for the management of invasive alien species

- Context and rationale
  - Invasive alien species can produce both negative and positive environmental, social, and economic impacts.
  - Management should be impact-based rather than species-based, aiming to mitigate negative effects and preserve or exploit beneficial uses where appropriate.
  - Decisions should incorporate diverse societal perspectives and stakeholder interests.

- The CONTAIN process: three-stage approach to identify, prioritise, and act on impacts
  - Stage 1: Catalogue impact outcomes, mechanisms, and assets
    - Use standardised methods (IUCN) to inventory impacts, their magnitude, affected assets, and whether impacts are positive or negative.
    - Ensure inventories reflect broad stakeholder views (experts, policymakers, managers, communities).
    - Document sources of information; example inventories are provided in an appendix.
  - Stage 2: Prioritise impact outcomes and decide on high-level actions
    - Prioritise impacts based on magnitude and confidence.
    - Assign high-level actions for each prioritised impact: do nothing; monitor; research; actively manage.
  - Stage 3: Define quantitative indicators
    - Specify measurable indicators to quantify impact magnitudes and to track progress of management actions.

- Practical details and references
  - The process is demonstrated with seven case examples across Chile, Brazil, and Argentina (involving 20 people within the CONTAIN project).
  - IUCN-based inventories require broad stakeholder representation and provide a transparent basis for prioritisation and action planning.
  - Examples illustrate linking prioritized impacts to concrete quantitative indicators.

- Case study highlights (examples from Table 1)
  - Invasive pines in Chile (active management priorities and indicators)
    - Priority impact outcomes: modification of fire regime; damage to agriculture; modification of hydrology/water regulation, purification and soil moisture; reduction in native biodiversity; alteration of recreational use and tourism.
    - Quantitative indicators: fuel load; biomass/primary productivity of grass; hydrological flow model; species richness and presence of alien species; human preferences for landscapes.
  - American mink in Argentina (active management priorities and indicators)
    - Priority impact outcomes: population size decline; modification of cultural, educational, aesthetic, religious and ornamental values.
    - Quantitative indicators: breeding success of affected native birds; population trends of affected native birds.

- Survey and stakeholder feedback
  - The project sought user opinions on the process’s novelty, clarity, completeness, usefulness, focus on impacts vs. species, required tools/capabilities for adoption, and experience duration with the target species.

- Appendix and data infrastructure
  - Example of an inventory of impacts provided as an Excel spreadsheet.
  - Sheets include: details of assessor and species; information on impacts; lists of standardised impact categories.

- Scope and outputs
  - Objective: develop and evaluate methods and tools for managing invasive alien species.
  - Outcome: a structured, participatory, data-driven framework to identify and prioritise impacts and to define actionable indicators for monitoring progress.
