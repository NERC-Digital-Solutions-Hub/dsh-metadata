# Methods and processes for the prioritisation of impacts and actions for the management of invasive alien species

- Purpose
  - Provide a structured, impact-based approach for identifying, prioritising, and addressing the environmental, social, and economic impacts of invasive alien species.
  - Emphasise mapping and spatially explicit data outputs to support GIS-based decision making and stakeholder-informed management.

- Context for GIS work
  - Impacts are diverse and can be both negative and positive; management should mitigate negative effects and consider positive resources (e.g., resources for angling or forestry).
  - Process yields inventories, priorities, and indicators that can be represented as geospatial data layers and dashboards.

- Geographic scope and case studies
  - Applied within the CONTAIN project across seven case examples in Chile, Brazil, and Argentina.
  - Demonstrates how to translate impacts into spatially-aware priorities and actions.

- The three-stage process (GIS-friendly framework)
  - Stage 1: Catalogue impact outcomes, mechanisms, and assets
    - Use standardized methods (IUCN) to inventory impacts, their magnitude, affected assets, and whether impacts are positive or negative.
    - Ensure inventories reflect diverse stakeholder views (experts, decision-makers, managers, communities).
    - Produce data components suitable for mapping (locations, affected assets, impact types).
  - Stage 2: Prioritise impact outcomes and decide on high-level actions
    - Prioritise impacts by magnitude and confidence.
    - Assign high-level actions for each prioritized impact: do nothing, monitor, research, actively manage.
  - Stage 3: Define quantitative indicators
    - Specify indicators to measure impact magnitude and track management progress.
    - Indicators can be mapped to monitor spatial and temporal changes.

- Data and outputs
  - Outputs include inventories of impacts, prioritised impacts with associated high-level actions, and quantitative indicators ready for GIS visualization.
  - Indicators illustrated with concrete measures linked to real-world outcomes.

- Case illustrations (from the project)
  - Case example: Grasses in Brazil demonstrates how impact outcomes, actions, and indicators can be aligned across stages.
  - Two examples of priority impacts and indicators (Table 1):
    - Invasive pines in Chile
      - Active management priorities: modification of fire regime, damage to agriculture, modification of hydrology/soil moisture, reduction in native biodiversity, alteration of recreational use and tourism.
      - Quantitative indicators: fuel load; biomass/primary productivity of grass; hydrological model outputs; species richness and presence of alien species; human landscape preferences.
    - American mink in Argentina
      - Active management priorities: population size decline; modification of cultural/educational/aesthetic values.
      - Quantitative indicators: breeding success of affected native birds; population trends of affected native birds.

- Stakeholder feedback and acceptance
  - A survey solicits opinions on the process’s interest, clarity, necessity, usefulness, and focus on impact-based management over species-based approaches.
  - Questions address tools and capabilities needed for implementation and the duration of experience with the species/system.

- Appendix and practical tooling
  - Appendix includes an example inventory of impacts (Excel spreadsheet) with:
    - Sheet 1: Assessor details and species evaluated.
    - Sheet 2: Impacts information.
    - Sheet 3: Standardised impacts and categories.
  - Provides a concrete data template for GIS teams to collect, standardise, and map the required information.

- Implications for GIS specialists
  - The process yields structured, map-ready data: impact types, magnitudes, assets affected, confidence levels, and indicators.
  - Enables creation of spatial dashboards and decision-support tools that reflect stakeholder perspectives and regional differences.
  - Highlights data gaps and the need for data standardisation, integration from multiple sources, and capacity-building within teams to manage large or complex datasets.
