# Plot_locations_metadata.rtf

- This file contains metadata for Plot_locations.csv, which holds the locations of the sampling sites.

## Experimental design / Sampling regime
- Three 75 m long transects, 20 m apart, across a hillslope perpendicular to the river Hiraethlyn.
- Along each transect, four boreholes were installed to bedrock at locations indicated in Plot_locations.csv.
- At some locations a second borehole was drilled, labelled 'new'; these do not differ from boreholes labelled 'old'.

## Collection methods and instrumentation
- Co-ordinates were collected with a handheld Garmin GPS device.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Latitude and Longitude collected as degrees, minutes, and seconds; converted to decimal degrees.
- Co-ordinates also recorded as six-figure Ordnance Survey National Grid references.

## Details of data structure
- Plot_locations.csv provides locations of sampling sites.
- Consists of 8 columns:
  - Name: Site identifier
  - Latitude: Latitude in decimal degrees
  - Longitude: Longitude in decimal degrees
  - Date: Date of measurement
  - Time: Time of measurement (Greenwich Mean Time)
  - Easting: British National Grid Easting
  - Northing: British National Grid Northing
  - ODN: Elevation in metres above Ordnance Datum Newlyn

## Projections and display notes
- For longitude and latitude values: GCS_WGS_1984 (WKID: 4326, EPSG).
- For Eastings and Northings: OSGB1936 British National Grid (WKID: 27700, EPSG).
- Ensure the base map is in the correct projection to display the sample sites accurately.
