# Plot_locations_metadata.rtf

- Purpose and scope
  - Metadata for Plot_locations.csv, which holds the locations of sampling sites.
- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Three transects, each 75 m long, spaced 20 m apart, across a hillslope and perpendicular to the river Hiraethlyn.
  - Along each transect, four boreholes drilled to bedrock at locations listed in Plot_locations.csv.
  - Some locations include a second borehole labelled 'new'; these do not differ from 'old'.
- Collection methods and instrumentation
  - Coordinates collected with a handheld Garmin GPS device.
  - Latitude and longitude recorded in degrees, minutes, seconds and converted to decimal degrees.
  - Also recorded as six-figure Ordnance Survey National Grid references.
- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Latitude and Longitude: decimal degrees (WGS84).
  - OS Grid references provided as six-figure Easting/Northing.
- Data structure (Plot_locations.csv)
  - 8 columns:
    - Name: Site identifier
    - Latitude: decimal degrees
    - Longitude: decimal degrees
    - Date: date of measurement
    - Time: time of measurement (GMT)
    - Easting: British National Grid Easting
    - Northing: British National Grid Northing
    - ODN: Elevation in metres above Ordnance Datum Newlyn
- Projections and coordinate reference systems
  - Correct projection is essential to display sample sites accurately.
  - Latitude/Longitude: GCS_WGS_1984 (WKID 4326, EPSG)
  - Eastings/Northings: OSGB1936 British National Grid (WKID 27700, EPSG)
- Notes and guidance
  - Ensure the base map uses the matching projection for accurate site plotting.
  - The image (courtesy Welsh Government) illustrates correct locations.
- Data interoperability and reuse considerations
  - The 8-column structure enables joining with other borehole data using the Name field.
  - Clear specification of coordinate systems facilitates integration into GIS and analysis workflows.
