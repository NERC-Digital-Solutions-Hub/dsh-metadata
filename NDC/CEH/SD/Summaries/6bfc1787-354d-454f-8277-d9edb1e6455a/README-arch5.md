# Supporting documentation for 'Macroinvertebrate sampling in the River Beas, India, 2017' data, by Visser-Quinn, A; Ncube, S; Beevers, L. and Adeloye, A.J.

## Overview
- Describes macroinvertebrate kick-sampling data collected at four sites along the River Beas, India, on 3–4 November 2017.
- Data follow the UK Environment Agency's semiquantitative protocol (Murray-Bligh, 1999) and were collected by S. Ncube.
- Corresponding author: a.visser-quinn@hw.ac.uk.

- SiteNumber: 1–4 (site identifiers)
- SiteName: site names
- Longitude: site longitude (degrees, minutes, seconds)
- Latitude: site latitude (degrees, minutes, seconds)
- SamplingDate: 3 November 2017 for sites 1–2; 4 November 2017 for sites 3–4
- MacroinvertebrateOrder: taxonomic order
- MacroinvertebrateFamily: taxonomic family
- NumberOfTaxa: count of macroinvertebrate taxa recorded during kick sampling

## Methods and Provenance
- Sampling conducted at four locations on the River Beas, India.
- Protocol: UK Environment Agency semiquantitative method (Murray-Bligh, 1999).
- Lead data collector: S. Ncube.
- Documentation includes explicit column heading explanations to clarify data fields.

## Metadata and Documentation
- Column headings are explicitly defined (e.g., 1 = Explanation; SiteNumber = Site number; etc.), supporting data interpretation.
- References the QA/QC framework in Murray-Bligh (1999) for sample collection and analysis.

## Data Quality, Standards, and Governance
- Use of a standardized protocol enhances comparability across datasets.
- Metadata includes clear field definitions and units (location coordinates, dates, taxonomic levels).
- Governance considerations:
  - Ensure accurate geospatial coordinates (longitude/latitude in consistent format).
  - Maintain versioning of the dataset and its metadata.
  - Document data collector, date ranges, and any data quality checks performed.

## Access, Sharing, and Preservation
- Contact point provided (corresponding author) for data access or clarifications.
- Data is described with a structured metadata approach to facilitate discovery and reuse.
- Consider archiving in an appropriate data portal with a stable identifier (e.g., DOI) and clear licensing.

## Potential Challenges for Data Stewards
- Ensuring timely availability of updated data or corrections to coordinate or taxonomic fields.
- Maintaining interoperability across formats if transferred to other systems.
- Aligning with broader data governance policies for microphone aquatic biology datasets.
