# Supporting documentation for 'Macroinvertebrate sampling in the River Beas, India, 2017' data, by Visser-Quinn, A; Ncube, S; Beevers, L. and Adeloye, A.J. Corresponding: a.visser-quinn@hw.ac.uk

## Aim and scope
- Documents macroinvertebrate kick-sampling data collected in four sites on the River Beas, India
- Sampling dates: 3–4 November 2017
- Follows the UK Environment Agency's standard semiquantitative protocol (Murray-Bligh, 1999)
- Data collected by S. Ncube
- Provides context and metadata to enable data reuse and integration with other datasets

## Data content and structure
- Dataset type: Macroinvertebrate kick-sampling observations
- Sites: Four sites along the River Beas
- Key variables (columns):
  - SiteNumber: Numeric site identifier (1, 2, 3, 4)
  - SiteName: Site name
  - Longitude: Location longitude (degrees, minutes, seconds)
  - Latitude: Location latitude (degrees, minutes, seconds)
  - SamplingDate: Sampling date per site (Sites 1–2 on 3 November 2017; Sites 3–4 on 4 November 2017)
  - MacroinvertebrateOrder: Taxonomic order of observed macroinvertebrates
  - MacroinvertebrateFamily: Taxonomic family of observed macroinvertebrates
  - NumberOfTaxa: Number of macroinvertebrate taxa recorded during kick sampling
- Column headings are documented as an explanation mapping (Column heading, 1 = Explanation; SiteNumber, 1 = Site number, etc.)

## Protocol and standards
- Data collection adheres to Murray-Bligh (1999) quality management standards for environmental monitoring
- Uses the Environment Agency’s procedure for collecting and analysing macroinvertebrate samples

## Data quality, usage, and considerations
- Metadata clarifies measurement units and date allocations, aiding data cleaning and integration
- Coordinates provided in degrees, minutes, and seconds; users may convert to decimal degrees for analysis
- Designed to enable “self-serve” exploration and to support combining with other datasets or time-series analyses
- Potential considerations for reuse:
  - Align sampling dates across sites for temporal analyses
  - Ensure taxonomic resolution (order and family) matches intended analyses
  - Verify any missing values or formatting differences when merging with other datasets
