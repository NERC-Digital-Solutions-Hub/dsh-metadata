# Supporting documentation for 'Macroinvertebrate sampling in the River Beas, India, 2017' data, by Visser-Quinn, A; Ncube, S; Beevers, L. and Adeloye, A.J. Corresponding: a.visser-quinn@hw.ac.uk

## What the data are
- Macroinvertebrate kick-sampling data collected at four sites along the River Beas, India.
- Sampling dates: 3–4 November 2017 (sites 1–2 on 3 November; sites 3–4 on 4 November).
- Protocol: UK Environment Agency semiquantitative method (Murray-Bligh 1999).
- Collected by S. Ncube; documentation prepared by Visser-Quinn, Beevers, Adeloye, with correspondence to a.visser-quinn@hw.ac.uk.

## Data structure and fields
- Column headings explained; key fields include:
  - SiteNumber: 1, 2, 3, 4
  - SiteName: site identifiers
  - Longitude: degrees, minutes, seconds
  - Latitude: degrees, minutes, seconds
  - SamplingDate: date of collection (3 Nov for sites 1–2; 4 Nov for sites 3–4)
  - MacroinvertebrateOrder: taxonomic order
  - MacroinvertebrateFamily: taxonomic family
  - NumberOfTaxa: count of macroinvertebrate taxa recorded per kick sample

## Provenance, quality, and references
- Data collected following the Environment Agency’s QA/QC protocol for macroinvertebrate sampling (Murray-Bligh 1999).
- Documentation serves as methodological and field data metadata to support data quality and reuse.

## Temporal and geographic context
- Four sampling sites on the River Beas, India
- Spatial coordinates recorded (longitude and latitude) for each site
- Temporal context: early November 2017 sampling window

## Data governance and leadership considerations
- Standardized, protocol-based data collection enhances comparability across sites and datasets
- Rich metadata support discoverability and alignment with data standards (location, time, taxonomic resolution)
- Taxonomic resolution at order and family levels facilitates rapid analysis and cross-network sharing
- Clear authorship and contact information supports data provenance and potential collaboration

## Uses and potential applications
- Supports environmental monitoring and river health assessment
- Can be integrated with other datasets for broader trend analyses of the River Beas
- Serves as a benchmark for QA/QC adherence to UK EA protocols in international contexts
