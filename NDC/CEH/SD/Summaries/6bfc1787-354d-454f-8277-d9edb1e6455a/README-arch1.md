# Supporting documentation for 'Macroinvertebrate sampling in the River Beas, India, 2017' data, by Visser-Quinn, A; Ncube, S; Beevers, L. and Adeloye, A.J. Corresponding: a.visser-quinn@hw.ac.uk

## Overview
- Dataset of macroinvertebrate kick-sampling collected at four sites along the River Beas, India.
- Sampling dates: 3 November 2017 (Sites 1 and 2) and 4 November 2017 (Sites 3 and 4).
- Followed the UK Environment Agency’s semiquantitative protocol (Murray-Bligh, 1999).
- Collected by S. Ncube; metadata and provenance documented for reuse and interpretation.

## Data structure and key fields
- SiteNumber: Identifier for each site (1, 2, 3, 4).
- SiteName: Name of each sampling site.
- Longitude: Longitude of site location (degrees, minutes, seconds).
- Latitude: Latitude of site location (degrees, minutes, seconds).
- SamplingDate: Sampling date per site (3 Nov 2017 for Sites 1–2; 4 Nov 2017 for Sites 3–4).
- Macro-invertebrateOrder: Taxonomic order of recorded macroinvertebrates.
- Macro-invertebrateFamily: Taxonomic family of recorded macroinvertebrates.
- NumberOfTaxa: Count of macroinvertebrate taxa observed during kick sampling.

## Methodology
- Sampling method: Kick sampling using the Environment Agency semiquantitative protocol.
- Source protocol reference: Murray-Bligh, 1999 (Quality management systems for environmental monitoring: biological techniques; EA Bristol).
- Data collection conducted by S. Ncube.

## Geographic and temporal context
- Four sampling sites along the River Beas, India.
- Spatial coordinates provided for each site (longitude and latitude in standard format).
- Temporal spread across two consecutive days (3–4 November 2017).

## Metadata and provenance
- Documented data dictionary detailing column headings and meanings.
- Corresponding author listed for inquiries: a.visser-quinn@hw.ac.uk.
- Cited reference for protocol and methodology included.

## Potential uses and analytical considerations for analysts with data focus
- Assess macroinvertebrate diversity by site and date using NumberOfTaxa.
- Examine community composition through Macro-invertebrateOrder and Macro-invertebrateFamily data.
- Compare taxa presence and richness across sites (spatial analysis) and between sampling dates (temporal analysis).
- Integrate with environmental or water quality data (if available) to model drivers of diversity and community structure.
- Consider limitations: small sample size (4 sites, 2 dates) and semiquantitative nature of the protocol when interpreting results; data scope limited to the River Beas in India for 2017.
