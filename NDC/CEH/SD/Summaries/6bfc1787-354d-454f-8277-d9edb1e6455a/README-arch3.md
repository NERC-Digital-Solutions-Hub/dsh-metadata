# Supporting documentation for 'Macroinvertebrate sampling in the River Beas, India, 2017' data, by Visser-Quinn, A; Ncube, S; Beevers, L. and Adeloye, A.J.

## Overview
- Document type: Supporting documentation for a macroinvertebrate dataset collected in 2017.
- Authors and contact: Visser-Quinn, A; Ncube, S; Beevers, L.; Adeloye, A.J.; Corresponding: a.visser-quinn@hw.ac.uk
- Purpose: Explain column headings and data structure to support understanding, reuse, and verification of the dataset.

## Data Collection and Protocol
- Method: Macroinvertebrate kick-sampling following the UK Environment Agency's semiquantitative protocol (Murray-Bligh, 1999).
- Location and timing: River Beas, India; four sites; samples collected on 3–4 November 2017.
- Field personnel: S. Ncube.

## Data Structure and Column Explanations
- Columns and meanings:
  - ColumnHeading: Explanation of each column.
  - SiteNumber: Identifier for each site (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.).
  - SiteName: Name of each sampling site.
  - Longitude: Site longitude (degrees, minutes, seconds).
  - Latitude: Site latitude (degrees, minutes, seconds).
  - SamplingDate: Date of sampling; Sites 1–2 on 3 November 2017; Sites 3–4 on 4 November 2017.
  - Macro-invertebrateOrder: Taxonomic order of recorded macroinvertebrates.
  - Macro-invertebrateFamily: Taxonomic family of recorded macroinvertebrates.
  - NumberOfTaxa: Number of macroinvertebrate taxa recorded during kick sampling.

## Metadata and Data Quality
- Emphasis on explicit metadata for reuse: detailed column definitions and protocol reference to support data integrity and interpretation.
- Location data availability (Longitude/Latitude) aids spatial analyses and governance.
