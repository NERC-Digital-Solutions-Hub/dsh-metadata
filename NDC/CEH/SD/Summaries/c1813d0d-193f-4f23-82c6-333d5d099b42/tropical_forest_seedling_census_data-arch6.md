# Danum Valley Seedling Census

## Overview
- Study of seedling plots and fruit dispersal counts during a mast fruiting event.
- Conducted in the unlogged primary forest of Danum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA) and adjacent selectively logged forest of Ulu Segama Forest Reserve (USFR), Sabah, Malaysia.
- Aims to compare seedling recruitment across forest types and management regimes and to produce data products enabling exploration of species- and time-specific regeneration patterns.

## Study sites and forestry context
- DVCA: 4°58' N, 117°52' E; 438 km2 of lowland dipterocarp forest and lower montane rainforest; high rainfall (~2305 mm/year) and mean temperature ~25.8°C.
- USFR adjacent to DVCA: logged 1981–1993; annual logging coupes (~27 km2); high-intensity extraction; Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) trial established in 1993; silvicultural restoration in a subset of coupes (restored vs natural regeneration).
- Restoration efforts: Innoprise-FACE Foundation Rainforest Rehabilitation Project; some plots actively restored, others left to natural regeneration.

## Sampling design
- Seedling plots: 1 m2 plots established in Sep–Oct 2019 during a mast fruiting event.
- DVCA plots: 87 plots within the ForestGEO Danum Valley 50 ha forest dynamics plot (primary forest).
- USFR plots: 96 plots within INDFORSUS project plots (52 actively restored; 44 naturally regenerating).
- Temporal scope: four census rounds from Sep–Oct 2019 to Feb–Mar 2021.

## Data collected
- Counts of fruits and seedlings by species per plot, recorded at four censuses.
- Species-level identifications in the field; unidentified species classified as morphospecies when necessary.
- Data intended to support comparisons across forest types (primary vs logged) and management regimes (natural regeneration vs active restoration).

## Data structure and variables (Danum_Valley_Seedling_Census.csv)
- Key columns:
  - Forest: primary or logged
  - Management: Natural Regeneration or Active Restoration
  - Seedling.Plot: plot identifier
  - Family: plant family
  - Species: scientific species name (morphospecies used for unidentifieds)
  - Date.1 / Date.2 / Date.3 / Date.4: census dates
  - Count.1 / Count.2 / Count.3 / Count.4: counts at each census
- Dataset records counts of fruits and seedlings by species per plot across all four censuses.

## Timeline of data collection
- Census 1: September–October 2019
- Census 2: November–December 2019
- Census 3: January–May 2020
- Census 4: February–March 2021

## Uses and analytical opportunities
- Compare seedling recruitment between primary DVCA and logged USFR plots.
- Assess impacts of restoration efforts versus natural regeneration on seedling/fruit dynamics.
- Examine species-specific responses to mast fruiting and temporal changes across plots and management regimes.
- Provide a self-serve data resource for exploring plot-level and species-level regeneration patterns.
