# Study site

- Study context: Ecological study in the unlogged Danum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA) primary forest and the adjacent selectively logged Ulu Segama Forest Reserve (USFR), focusing on seedling recruitment during a mast fruiting event and subsequent censuses.
- Location and climate: 
  - DVCA: upper Segama River catchment, Sabah, Malaysia; ~438 km2 of lowland dipterocarp forest and lower montane rainforest.
  - USFR: neighboring logged forest; coordinates 4°58' N, 117°52' E.
  - Climate: ~2305 mm annual rainfall; mean daily temperature ~25.8°C.
- Nearby land-use context: Adjacent to a 10,000 km2 logging concession with historical selective logging; silvicultural interventions and restoration projects implemented in parts of USFR.

- Data collection sites and design:
  - Seedling plots: 1 m2 plots established in Sep–Oct 2019 during a mast fruiting event.
  - DVCA plots: 87 seedling plots within the Danum Valley 50 ha forest dynamics plot (unlogged primary forest).
  - USFR plots: 96 seedling plots (52 actively restored; 44 naturally regenerating) within INDFORSUS project plots.
  - Census schedule: Four fruit/seedling censuses from Sep 2019 to Mar 2021 (Census 1: Sep–Oct 2019; Census 2: Nov–Dec 2019; Census 3: Jan–May 2020; Census 4: Feb–Mar 2021).
  - Data collected: Counts of fruits and new seedlings by species (field-identified to species; some morphospecies for unidentified taxa).

- Data content and structure:
  - Dataset: Danum_Valley_Seedling_Census.csv.
  - Key fields (examples): 
    - Forest (primary vs logged) and Management (Natural Regeneration vs Active Restoration).
    - Seedling.Plot (plot identifier).
    - Family and Species (taxonomic classification; morphospecies for unidentified).
    - Date and Count for each census (Date.1/Count.1, Date.2/Count.2, Date.3/Count.3, Date.4/Count.4).
  - Purpose: Counts of fruits and seedlings by species and plot across four census periods, capturing recruitment dynamics in contrasting forest management regimes.

- Data quality, metadata, and governance considerations:
  - Explicit field definitions and census timing provide clear metadata for longitudinal comparisons.
  - Species-level identifications enable biodiversity assessments; presence of morphospecies indicates unresolved taxonomic items.
  - Data provenance includes site histories (unlogged vs logged, restoration interventions) and mast-fruiting timing, informing context for analyses.
  - Potential data integration considerations: aligning plots across management regimes, ensuring consistent species concepts, and handling unidentified morphospecies in cross-site comparisons.

- Implications for data leadership and use:
  - Valuable for monitoring forest regeneration, restoration effectiveness, and community-level ecological responses to disturbance.
  - Useful for cross-site data sharing and benchmarking of seedling recruitment under different management regimes.
  - Highlights data-gaps and opportunities for expanded metadata (e.g., more detailed restoration treatments, plot-level environmental covariates) to enhance data discoverability and reusability.
