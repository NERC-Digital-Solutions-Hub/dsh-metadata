# Study site

- Location and study design: Conducted in the unlogged primary forest of Danum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA) and the adjacent selectively logged Ulu Segama Forest Reserve (USFR) in Sabah, Malaysia (DVCA: 438 km2; DVCA climate ~2305 mm annual rainfall; mean daily temp ~25.8°C). USFR region sampled was historically logged 1981–1993, with a 1993 Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) trial and silvicultural restoration efforts under the Innoprise-FACE Foundation Rainforest Rehabilitation Project; most of the area regrew naturally.
- Purpose within environmental monitoring: Establishes standardized, plot-based data to assess forest regeneration and environmental health across primary and logged/partially restored forests, enabling temporal comparisons and policy-relevant insights.

- Seedling plot establishment and scope: In September–October 2019, during a mast fruiting event, 1 m2 seedling plots were installed:
  - DVCA (primary forest): 87 plots within the ForestGEO Danum Valley 50 ha forest dynamics plot.
  - USFR (logged forest): 96 plots (52 actively restored; 44 naturally regenerating) under the Indicators of Forest Sustainability (INDFORSUS) project.
- Data collected per plot: Counts of fruits dispersed and new seedlings by species, with species-level identification where possible (unidentified species recorded as morphospecies).
- Census schedule: Four census rounds covering seed fruits and seedlings from Sept–Oct 2019 to Feb–Mar 2021:
  1) Sep–Oct 2019
  2) Nov–Dec 2019
  3) Jan–May 2020
  4) Feb–Mar 2021

- Data structure and availability: The dataset is organized in Danum_Valley_Seedling_Census.csv, with columns detailing:
  - Forest status (primary vs logged)
  - Management regime (Natural Regeneration vs Active Restoration)
  - Seedling.Plot identifiers
  - Plant Family and Species (with morphospecies for unidentified taxa)
  - Census dates and counts for each of the four survey rounds
- Key objective and outputs: Produce counts of fruits and seedlings by species and plot across the four censuses to assess regeneration dynamics, forest recovery, and the influence of restoration versus natural regeneration under differing disturbance histories.

- Relevance to environmental monitoring aims: Demonstrates standardized data collection, quality control, and transformation into outputs (species-specific regeneration data) across forest types, enabling characterization of environmental health and informing policy/management over time. Data are prepared in a format suitable for integration into monitoring portals and comparative analyses across sites and regimes.
