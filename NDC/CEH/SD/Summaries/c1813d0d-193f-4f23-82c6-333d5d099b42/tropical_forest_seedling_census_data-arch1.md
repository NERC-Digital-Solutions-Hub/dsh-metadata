# Study site

- Location and forest types
  - Danum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA): unlogged primary forest, 438 km2, in the upper catchment of the Segama River, Sabah, Malaysia; consists of lowland dipterocarp forest and lower montane rainforest.
  - Adjacent Ulu Segama Forest Reserve (USFR): selectively logged region studied, geographically near DVCA (4°58' N, 117°52' E); adjacent logging concession previously logged between 1981–1993.
- Climate and logging history
  - Mean annual rainfall around 2305 mm; mean daily temperature ~25.8°C.
  - USFR logging: annual logging coupes ~27 km2; high-intensity extraction (~118 m3 ha-1 from 1970–1990); methods included tractor logging on moderate terrain and high-lead cables on steep slopes.
  - Silvicultural interventions: in 1993, Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) trial; some coupes underwent restoration to actively restore forest carbon stocks (Innoprise-FACE Foundation Rainforest Rehabilitation Project); others left to natural recovery.
- Seedling sampling design
  - Seedling plots: 1 m2 plots established in Sep–Oct 2019 during a mast fruiting event.
  - DVCA plots: 87 plots within the ForestGEO Danum Valley 50 ha forest dynamics plot (primary forest).
  - USFR plots: 96 plots within the INDFORSUS project (logged forest), of which 52 were actively restored and 44 were naturally regenerating.
  - Data collection: fruits dispersed and new seedling recruits counted on all plots across four censuses (Sept–Oct 2019; Nov–Dec 2019; Jan–May 2020; Feb–Mar 2021); species-level identification in the field.
- Data and dataset structure
  - Dataset name: Danum_Valley_Seedling_Census.csv.
  - Key columns and structure:
    - Forest (primary vs logged) and Management (Natural Regeneration vs Active Restoration).
    - Seedling.Plot (plot identifier).
    - Family and Species (plant taxonomy; unidentified species grouped as morphospecies).
    - Date.1 to Date.4 and Count.1 to Count.4 (dates and counts for each census).
  - Purpose: quantify fruiting and seedling recruitment by species and plot across forest types and management regimes, enabling comparisons of restoration efficacy, natural regeneration, and responses to mast fruiting.
