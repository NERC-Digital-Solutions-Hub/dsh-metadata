# Sampling Rationale and Locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Assess the impact of a 2019 wildfire on water quality in Flow Country peatland catchments.
  - Monthly water sampling of 52 rivers/streams over just over a year (Sept 2019–2020/2021) as part of the FIRE Blanket project.
  - Measurements focused on dissolved organic matter (cDOM/fDOM, DOC) and a suite of physico-chemical parameters.

- Study sites and design
  - 52 sampling sites; 42 had pre-fire data from FREEDOM and LOCATE projects to serve as reference.
  - FREEDOM sites (30): undrained, drained, and near-forest peatland catchments.
  - LOCATE sites (12): along Halladale River.
  - Additional sites selected post-fire to directly measure wildfire effects, chosen for accessibility, channel characteristics, flow, stratification, and peat properties (degraded and near-natural peatlands).
  - Site labeling included Burned (Degraded and Near-Natural), LOCATE, FREEDOM, Undrained, Drained, Forest, and others, with detailed coordinates and stream names (Table 1).

- Sampling schedule and disruptions
  - Monthly river sampling; field access disruptions caused by shooting activities (Nov 2019) and Covid-19 restrictions (Apr–Jun 2020).
  - Sampling and analysis schedule adjusted mid-project to ensure timely shipment to laboratories (NOC and UKCEH) and processing at ERI.

- Field sampling methodology
  - In-field collection using a bucket; physico-chemical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, temperature) measured in situ with a calibrated Hanna HI-991300 multiparameter probe.
  - Filtration in the field (0.45 µm) for certain analyses; sample bottles prepared with ISO-compliant cleaning and conditioning.
  - Field data recorded on forms, including site code, date/time, site characteristics, and any environmental notes.

- Sample containers, preservation, and handling (Table 2)
  - cDOM and fDOM: amber glass, 30 mL, filtered, preserved at 4°C in dark.
  - DOC: amber glass, 30 mL, filtered, preserved at 4°C in dark.
  - Nutrients: 50 mL polypropylene tubes, filtered, preserved at 4°C in dark.
  - Dissolved metals: 50 mL polypropylene tubes, filtered, preserved with nitric acid and stored at 4°C in dark.
  - Documentation of container types, volumes, treatment, preservation, and sites.

- Storage, transport, and timing
  - Cold-chain handling: samples kept in a cold box during transit; refrigerated and protected from light upon return to ERI.
  - Nutrients and TOC analyses performed within 2–5 days; heavy metals stored with acidification and kept at 4°C; some samples shipped to NOC/UKCEH for absorbance analyses.
  - Detailed recording of site codes, sampling dates, physico-chemical parameters, and field observations; data organized in spreadsheets on the ERI server and shared with partners.

- Field equipment and measurement setup
  - Essential gear: GPS device (with coordinates), printed site maps, protocol copies, sampling bottles, filters, syringes, buckets, and a multiparameter probe.
  - Field calibration: pH (two-point) and EC (CRM calibration) performed before each field campaign; special note for a marine site where conductivity exceeded probe range.

- Laboratory analyses and instrumentation
  - Dissolved nutrients (NH4+, SRP, TON): SEAL AQ2 Discrete Analyser; ISO-standard methods; use of CRMs and standards; quality control via calibration curves and instrument re-runs as needed.
  - DOC: Shimadzu TOC-L analyser (680°C combustion, NPOC); internal standard and CRM usage; periodic recalibration and automatic dilution for high concentrations.
  - Absorbance (SUVA and UV-Vis): PerkinElmer Lambda 365; UKCEH and NOC performed absorbance at various wavelengths; SUVA254 calculated to assess aromaticity; inter-lab comparison conducted (July 2020) with high correlation (R² ≈ 0.99).
  - Dissolved metals (New Burned and LOCATE sites only): ICP-OES (Varian 720 ES); dilution to fit calibration range; inclusion of river CRM for QC; multi-element analysis (major cations, redox-sensitive elements, and potential toxins like Cu, Zn, Ni).
  - Documentation and data handling: data recorded in a structured dataset with lab-specific columns (ERI, NOC, UKCEH); limit of detection (LOD) calculated per run as LOD = mean blank + 3 × SD of blanks; non-detects labeled as <LOD.

- Data structure and units
  - Dataset includes sampling information (sample codes, dates) and analysis results from each lab (ERI, NOC, UKCEH).
  - Table 4 defines column headings, descriptions, and units (e.g., Cond µS/cm, Temp °C, pH, N-NH3 µg N/L, SRP µg P/L, TON µg N/L, NPOC mg/L, Abs_254 nm, SUVA, dissolved metals in µg/L for various elements).
  - Handling of missing data with a placeholder (−) and explicit notation of detections vs. <LOD.

- Data quality assurance and cross-lab coordination
  - Use of certified reference materials, blanks, and standard solutions across labs to validate methods.
  - Inter-lab absorbance comparison conducted to assess consistency between NOC and UKCEH measurements.
  - Regular QA steps embedded in the workflow, including calibration checks, replicates, and QA samples (CRMs) in each batch.

- Data governance and stewardship implications
  - Data provenance documented from field collection to laboratory analysis; explicit linking of samples to site codes and dates.
  - Metadata-rich dataset with clear definitions of each variable and units, enabling discoverability and reuse by researchers and agencies.
  - Storage on institutional servers (ERI) with sharing among project partners; clear data processing workflow and versioning considerations implied by cross-lab collaboration and interim datasets.

- Notable challenges and limitations
  - Access issues and safety constraints led to site-specific sampling adjustments and potential gaps (e.g., November 2019, Apr–Jun 2020).
  - Some sites labeled as N/A or with incomplete coordinates, reflecting field realities and complex site conditions.
  - Data gaps due to delays or disruptions acknowledged in the sampling and analysis routine and scheduling.
  
- Reference and data usage
  - Data support for evaluating wildfire effects on peatland catchment water quality and dissolved carbon fluxes.
  - Comprehensive methodology supports reproducibility, QA/QC, and potential meta-analyses across similar watershed wildfire studies.
