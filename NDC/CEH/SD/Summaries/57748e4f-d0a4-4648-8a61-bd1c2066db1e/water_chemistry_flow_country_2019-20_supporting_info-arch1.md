# Sampling Rationale and Locations

- Purpose: Assess the impact of a 2019 wildfire on water quality in Flow Country peatlands by tracking dissolved organic matter (DOM) and other physico-chemical parameters in 52 streams/rivers over about a year, using pre-fire reference data where available.
- Context: Fire occurred in May 2019; sampling began September 2019. NOV 2019 sampling missed due to access. Covid-19 caused no sampling April–June 2020.
- Sites and design:
  - 52 sampling sites across Flow Country peatlands (Caithness and Sutherland).
  - 42 sites with pre-fire data from FREEDOM and LOCATE projects.
  - FREEDOM: 30 sites representing undrained, drained, and near-forest peatland catchments.
  - LOCATE: 12 sites along the Halladale River.
  - Additional sites selected to directly measure wildfire effects; chosen for safety/accessibility, channel and peat characteristics, and flow/stratification; included degraded and near-natural peatland catchments.
- Site labeling and data coverage:
  - Burned sites labeled (e.g., B-D-1 to B-D-5 for Burnt-Degraded; B-N-1 to B-N-5 for Burnt-Near-Natural) with corresponding stream names and coordinates.
  - Table 1 lists site names, codes, stream names, and coordinates.
  - Table 4 summarizes data columns and units; data merged from ERI, NOC, and UKCEH with standardized formats and a uniform limit-of-detection (LOD) scheme. 
- Objectives tied to data quality:
  - Use a combination of pre-fire reference data and post-fire observations to identify fire-related changes in water quality and DOM characteristics.
  - Maintain traceability of data sources, with metadata and site information documented for each sampling campaign. 

## Sampling, Field Collection, and Measurements

- In-field sampling protocol:
  - Water collected with a 50 mL bucket from near the center of the flow.
  - In situ physico-chemical measurements (pH, electrical conductivity, temperature) taken with a Hanna HI-991300 multiparameter probe, calibrated before each campaign.
  - Field labeling includes project name, site code, and sampling date.
  - Field filtration: 0.45 µm cellulose acetate filter for water/ sediment separation prior to certain analyses.
  - Sample containers and preservation varied by determinant; bottles were pre-cleaned and pre-conditioned; samples stored in amber glass or specified plastics; protected from light and cooled.
- Storage and transport:
  - Cold chain maintained: samples refrigerated immediately on return and stored in darkness.
  - Nutrients and TOC analyses performed within 2–5 days after collection; metals samples acidified with nitric acid and stored at 4°C in the dark.
  - Some samples shipped to NOC/UKCEH for specific analyses in insulated boxes with ice packs.
- Data capture and logging:
  - Field forms recorded site code, date/time, physico-chemical parameters, and environmental notes.
  - End-of-campaign data and analytical results organized into spreadsheets on the ERI server and shared with partners.

## Sampling Schedule and Timeline

- Routine: Monthly river sampling across sites; analyses conducted within about one week after collection.
- Exceptions and adaptations:
  - November 2019: sampling halted due to access restrictions (shooting activities).
  - 2020: Covid-19 caused further interruptions; scheduling adjusted to ensure timely shipment and lab processing.
- Logistics:
  - Initial plan separated New Burnt/LOCATE and FREEDOM sites by week, but access vehicle and later covid constraints led to a single weekly window for all sites to facilitate shipment and in-lab analyses.

## Field Equipment

- Essential items for each field visit:
  - GPS device with saved coordinates; printed site maps; protocol copy with permissions; labeling materials; field recording forms.
  - Sampling tools: 50 mL syringe with 0.45 µm syringe filter; plastic bucket; sample containers (50 mL/15 mL tubes, 30 mL amber bottles, 250 mL Nalgene).
  - Instrument: Hanna HI-991300 multiparameter probe for pH, EC, and temperature.
- Calibration and validation:
  - Probe calibration prior to campaigns; pH two-point calibration (pH 7.01 and 4.01 buffers); EC calibrated with a 1413 µS cm-1 standard.

## Laboratory Processing and Analysis

- Laboratories and instruments:
  - ERI (Thurso): SEAL AQ2 Discrete Analyzer for dissolved nutrients; Shimadzu TOC-L for DOC; ICP-OES (Varian 720 ES) for dissolved metals; UV-Vis absorbance (Cary Eclipse) and UKCEH (Lambda 365) for absorbance.
  - QA/QC: Milli-Q water purification; certified reference materials; calibration checks; instrument-specific best practices.
- Standards and reagents:
  - Ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), and total oxidised nitrogen (TON) analyzed with ISO-aligned methods using calibrated standards; CRMs used for validation.
  - TON determined via cadmium coil reduction followed by a sulfanilamide-NEDD reaction with photometric detection.
  - DOC analyzed by TOC-L using non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC) method after inorganic carbon removal.
- Absorbance and SUVA254:
  - UV-Vis absorbance measured 230–800 nm (1 nm steps); SUVA254 calculated as absorbance at 254 nm normalized by DOC concentration and path length.
  - Inter-lab comparison for July 2020 samples showed high correlation (R2 = 0.99) between NOC and UKCEH measurements; small systematic differences noted.
- Dissolved metals (New Burnt and LOCATE sites only):
  - ICP-OES used to measure macro and trace elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Mn, Al, S, Cu, Zn, Ni, etc.).
  - Samples diluted as needed; river water CRM included in every run for QA.
  - Data quality controlled with duplicate measurements and re-analysis if concentrations exceeded calibration range.

## Data and Units

- Data structure:
  - Dataset includes sampling metadata (site code, sample ID, dates) and laboratory results from ERI (columns D–J, O–AE), NOC (K–L), and UKCEH (M–N).
- Detection and reporting:
  - Limit of Detection (LOD) calculated per instrument per analysis: LOD = mean of blanks + 3 × standard deviation of blanks.
  - Values below LOD reported as <LOD; missing information represented by a dash.
- Reported determinants and units:
  - Conductivity (µS/cm), Temperature (°C), pH (unitless), NH4+ (µg N/L), SRP (µg P/L), TON (µg N/L), NPOC (mg/L), Absorbance at 254 nm (nm), SUVA (mg C/L/m), Sulfate (mg/L), and dissolved metals (µg/L) for listed elements.
- Data management:
  - Comprehensive documentation and metadata maintained; datasets prepared for cross-laboratory comparability and transparency.

## Key Determinants and Methods Summary

- DOM-focused measurements: cDOM, fDOM, DOC, and UV-Vis absorbance (including SUVA254) to assess aromatic DOM components and changes after wildfire.
- Nutrients and nitrogen cycle indicators: NH4+, SRP, TON, and TOC to evaluate nutrient dynamics and organic carbon processing.
- Metals and oxidation state indicators: Dissolved metals (where analyzed) to assess potential mobilization of elements post-fire.
- Data quality emphasis: ISO-aligned analytic methods, calibrated standards, CRMs, and cross-lab comparisons to ensure comparability and reliability of results.
