# Sampling Rationale and Locations

- Purpose: Assess the impact of the 2019 wildfire on water quality in Flow Country streams by tracking dissolved organic matter (cDOM/fDOM/DOC) and other physico-chemical parameters over about one year, using pre-fire data for context.
- Study frame: NERC FIRE Blanket project; monthly sampling of 52 rivers/streams in Flow Country from Sept 2019, with some interruptions (Nov 2019 sampling missed due to shooting; Apr–Jun 2020 halted by Covid-19).
- Pre-fire reference data: 42 of the 52 sites had pre-fire data from FREEDOM (30 sites: undrained, drained, near-forest peatland catchments) and LOCATE (12 sites along Halladale River), enabling assessment of fire-induced changes.
- Site classification (sampling framework):
  - Burned sites: Burnt - Degraded (B-D) and Burnt - Near-Natural (B-N)
  - LOCATE Sites
  - FREEDOM Sites
  - Flow Country catchments represented: degraded vs near-natural peatlands after fire
  - Additional site categories used for context: Undrained (F-U), Drained (F-D), Forest (F-F)
- Site details: 52 sampling sites with coordinates and stream names; selection balanced to capture accessibility, channel characteristics, flow/stratification, and peat characteristics post-fire.
- Rationale for site selection: mixture of directly burned sites and reference/comparison sites to understand immediate and residual fire effects on water quality.

- Data scope and outputs:
  - Analytes: Dissolved organic matter (cDOM, fDOM, DOC), nutrients (NH4+, SRP/PO4 3-, TON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC; NPOC method), absorbance properties (UV-Vis: A254; SUVA254), and dissolved metals (macro and trace elements; several target ions).
  - Additional measurements: In-field pH, electrical conductivity (EC), temperature; filtration and sample fractionation to separate water and sediment for specific analyses; metals analyzed only for New Burned and LOCATE sites.

- Data and output management:
  - Data generated by three laboratories (ERI, NOC, UKCEH) with standardized column structures; LODs calculated per analysis and per instrument; missing data denoted as -.
  - Field data, samples, and results stored on the ERI server; datasets prepared for sharing with project partners and uploading to appropriate portals.

- Reporting and references:
  - Study uses ISO-adapted analytical methods for nutrients (NH4+, SRP, TON), DOC (TOC-L), and dissolved metals (ICP-OES); absorbance measurements conducted at UKCEH and NOC; UV-Vis absorbance used for transparency and aromaticity indicators (SUVA).
  - References to methodological quality control include use of CRMs, calibration curves, and instrument-specific QA checks; measurement uncertainties addressed via blanks and duplicate/reanalysis protocols.

- Documentation and schedules:
  - Tables referenced for site details (Table 1 with coordinates and site names), containers and preservation (Table 2), and sampling/analysis schedule (Table 3).
  - Field equipment list includes GPS, maps, sampling bottles, syringe/filter, multiparameter probe, and standard lab supplies; field calibration performed prior to campaigns.
  - Special considerations: ocean site (L-13-R-ES) had conductivity beyond the instrument range; all sampling and storage protocols followed to minimize chemistry changes between collection and analysis.
