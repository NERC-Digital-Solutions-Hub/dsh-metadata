# Sampling Rationale and Locations

- Context and aim
  - Following a drought in 2018 and a wildfire in May 2019, the study assesses how the fire affected water quality in Flow Country peatlands (northern Scotland) by tracking dissolved organic matter and a suite of physico-chemical parameters.
  - The project builds on pre-fire data from FREEDOM and LOCATE to understand changes during and after the fire.

- Site selection and sampling design
  - 52 sampling sites across Flow Country rivers and streams; 42 sites had pre-fire data from FREEDOM (undrained, drained, near-forest) and LOCATE (Halladale River).
  - 30 FREEDOM sites represent different peatland catchment types; 12 LOCATE sites along Halladale River.
  - Additional sites selected post-fire to directly measure wildfire effects, chosen for accessibility, channel characteristics, flow, peat type, and to represent degraded (n=5) and near-natural (n=5) peatlands.
  - Temporal aspects: monthly sampling from Sep 2019; note gaps in Nov 2019 (restricted access) and Apr–Jun 2020 (COVID-19 restrictions).

- Field sampling and in situ measurements
  - Physical collection: manual sampling with a plastic bucket; samples taken from near the river/stream center.
  - In situ measurements: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and temperature using a Hanna HI-991300 multiparameter probe, calibrated before each campaign.
  - Sample handling: bottles labelled with project/site/date; field filtration (0.45 µm) for certain analyses; strict rinsing protocols to avoid contamination; use of amber glass for filtered organic analyses; adequate preservation (cool, dark storage).

- Sample types, containers, and preservation
  - cDOM and fDOM: 30 mL amber glass bottles; filtered; stored at 4°C in darkness.
  - DOC: 30 mL amber glass bottles; filtered; stored at 4°C.
  - Nutrients (NH4+, SRP, TON) and metals: 50 mL/15 mL polypropylene tubes; filtered; preservation specifics vary (e.g., metals acidified with nitric acid, stored at 4°C in the dark).
  - Storage and transport: samples kept cool during transport; refrigerated upon return to the lab; analyses conducted promptly (2–5 days for nutrients; metals stored longer with acid preservation).

- Sampling and analysis timeline
  - Monthly river sampling with analyses conducted within about a week; macro and trace metals sometimes stored/analysed in batches (acidified and refrigerated).
  - Schedule adjustments due to field logistics and COVID-19; detailed weekly/weekly-shift plan provided in Table 3 to coordinate sampling and laboratory analyses across sites and labs.

- Lab analyses and instrumentation
  - Dissolved nutrients: NH4+, SRP, TON analysed with SEAL AQ2 Discrete Analyser using ISO-based methods; calibration with certified standards and CRMs; automated colourimetric detection via standard reagents.
  - DOC: quantified with Shimadzu TOC-L using 680°C catalytic oxidation and NPOC approach; quality controls with internal standard and TOC CRM; automatic dilution for high concentrations.
  - Absorbance and SUVA: UV-Vis absorbance (230–800 nm) with SUVA254 calculation; inter-lab comparison between NOC (UK) and FREEDOM sites; July 2020 inter-lab comparison shows high correlation (R^2 = 0.99).
  - Dissolved metals (New Burned and LOCATE sites only): ICP-OES (Varian 720 ES) for base cations, redox-sensitive elements, and potentially toxic elements; samples diluted to fit instrument range; external river water CRM used for QA.
  - Analytical equipment and labs: analyses primarily at ERI (Thurso), with additional work at NOC (Southampton) and UKCEH (Edinburgh); use of standardized reagents, calibrants, and CRMs for QA.

- Data management, structure, and QA/QC
  - Data capture: dataset includes sample metadata (sample IDs, dates) and laboratory results from ERI, NOC, and UKCEH; includes measured fields for conductivity, temperature, pH, NH4, SRP, TON, NPOC, Abs_254, SUVA, and dissolved metals.
  - QA/QC: calibration curves and CRMs used; LODs calculated per analysis based on blanks; samples reported with <LOD when applicable; inter-lab comparison conducted for absorbance.
  - Data format: missing information denoted with a dash; table mappings describe column headings, units, and descriptions.
  - Data governance and sharing: field data and analytical results compiled and stored on project servers; outputs shared with project partners; emphasis on traceability and cross-lab comparability.

- Key findings relevant to monitoring and policy
  - The design demonstrates how pre-event baselines (FREEDOM/LOCATE) enable assessment of wildfire impacts on peatland-derived water quality.
  - A comprehensive suite of indicators was collected, spanning inorganic nutrients, dissolved organic matter (cDOM/fDOM, DOC), absorbance properties (SUVA), and dissolved metals, enabling assessment of biogeochemical shifts post-fire.
  - The protocol emphasizes rigorous QA/QC, standardised methods, and cross-lab comparability to support credible monitoring for policy evaluation and decision-making.

- Practical considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - Importance of baseline data from prior projects to contextualize post-event changes.
  - Need for multi-site coverage across different peatland states (degraded vs near-natural) to capture heterogeneity.
  - Adoption of ISO-like methods, CRMs, and QA/QC procedures to ensure data reliability for policy use.
  - Structured data management and clear documentation of sampling, handling, analysis, and data integration across laboratories.
  - Flexibility to adapt sampling schedules due to unforeseen disruptions (security access, pandemics) while maintaining data integrity.
