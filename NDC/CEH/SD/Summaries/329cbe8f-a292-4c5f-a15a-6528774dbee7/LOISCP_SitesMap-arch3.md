# HUMBER CATHCMENT

## Aim
- To identify environmental health measures for scrutinising and evaluating policy, and informing future decisions.

## Who they are
- They work in managerial roles within government departments or environmental quangos, responsible for deciding on and implementing environmental health monitoring approaches.

## How they meet their aims
- They understand what measures provide useful insight by speaking to stakeholders and experts, learning from others to avoid duplication.
- They find and verify available data, often overcoming shortcomings in metadata by contacting the originators of datasets.
- They may need to add metadata to datasets and often must publicly share the data used, which can be a barrier.
- They commission new data to fill gaps, ensuring quality, openness, and data management standards are set at the source.
- They ensure data is quality assured, cleaned, transformed, analysed, and findings are presented clearly, often through reports, charts, or dashboards.
- They disseminate outputs, consult stakeholders, ensure underlying data is shared appropriately, and implement data governance processes.

## Particular Challenges
- A lack of data, including data at a good enough standard.
- A lack of access to data, including in a timely manner.
- The existence of 'silos' within and between organisations is a significant barrier in some cases.
- The requirement to publicly share datasets used can be a barrier to using some existing data.
- Concerns about keeping data up to date were cited as barriers to data sharing by some.
- Inadequate metadata is a barrier to readily verifying whether data would meet requirements.
- The format of data often requires effortful transformation to make it useable.
- Deciding how to communicate complex findings clearly.
- Putting data governance processes in place to ensure datasets meet standards, and are stored, shared, and kept up to date appropriately.
