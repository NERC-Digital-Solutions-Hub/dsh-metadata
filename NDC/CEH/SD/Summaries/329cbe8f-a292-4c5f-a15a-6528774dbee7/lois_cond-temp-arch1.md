# LOIS Core Programme

## Overview
- On-site measurements of pH, conductivity, and temperature for 16 sites (13 in the Humber catchment and 3 in the Tweed catchment) conducted between 1994 and 1997.

## Variables and units
- pH: pH units
- Conductivity (25C): µS/cm
- Temperature (water): °C
- At each site, measurements used the full set of variables (All variables).

## Study sites and locations
- Humber catchment:  
  - Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1, NGR SE225994)  
  - Swale at Thornton Manor (S2, NGR SE433715)  
  - Ure at Boroughbridge (U3, NGR SE395671)  
  - Nidd at Skip Bridge (N4, NGR SE482561)  
  - Wharfe at Tadcaster (W5, NGR SE487435)  
  - Ouse at Clifton Bridge (O6, NGR SE589528)  
  - Derwent at Bubwith (D7, NGR SE706364)  
  - Aire at Beal Bridge (A8, NGR SE534255)  
  - Calder at Methley Bridge (C9, NGR SE409258)  
  - Don at Sprotborough Bridge (D10, NGR SE538014)  
  - Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11, NGR SK807612)  
  - Ouse at Acaster Malbis (O12, NGR SE594445)  
- Tweed catchment:  
  - Tweed at Boleside (TW13, NGR NT498334)  
  - Tweed at Norham (TW14, NGR NT898477)  
  - Tweed at Ormiston Mill (TW15, NGR NT702280)  
- Additional site: Aire at Allerton Bywater (A20, NGR SE417274)

## Sampling schedule
- Regular weekly sampling across all sites.
- Additional sampling roughly once per month per site during high-flow periods.

## How measurements were made
- Sample collection: wide-neck PTFE bottle in a plastic-covered bottle carrier (collected from bridges when possible; otherwise by immersing bottle in the water near the main flow).
- pH and conductivity: Mettler Toledo Check Mate meters/probes.
- Temperature: PT100 probe with Digitron 3204 meter.

## Calibration and quality control
- pH probes: calibrated in the laboratory with buffers pH 7.0 and 10.00.
- Conductivity probes: calibrated in air and with 1417 µS KCl standard.
- On-site checks: calibration drift checked and recalibrated if necessary.

## Data quality and handling
- Measurements: three readings per sample, averaged after gentle swirling for two minutes in a freshly collected sample.
- Conducted by: field sampling team at York University.

## Data provenance and references
- Source: LOIS river monitoring network; strategy and implementation described by Leeks et al. (1997).
