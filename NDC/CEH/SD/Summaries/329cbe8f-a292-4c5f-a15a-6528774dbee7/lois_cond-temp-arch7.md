# LOIS Core Programme

## Overview
- On-site measurements of pH, Conductivity (25C), and Temperature for 16 sites (13 Humber catchment, 3 Tweed catchment) during 1994–1997.

## Variables and Units
- pH: pH units
- Conductivity (25C): uS/cm
- Temperature (water): Celsius

## Temporal Coverage
- Sampling frequency: weekly intervals.
- Additional sampling: more intermittent during high flows (roughly one extra sample per site per month).

## Methods
- Sample collection: wide-neck PTFE bottle in a plastic carrier; from bridges where possible; otherwise immersed near main flow.
- pH and conductivity: Mettler Toledo Check Mate meters/probes.
- Temperature: PT 100 probe with Digitron 3204 Pt meter.

## Quality Assurance and Data Quality
- pH calibration: laboratory buffers pH 7.0 and 10.00.
- Conductivity calibration: in air and with 1417 uS KCl standard.
- On-site drift checks and recalibration if necessary.
- Readings: three readings per sample; average used.

## Data Stewardship
- Measurements conducted by the field sampling team at York University.
