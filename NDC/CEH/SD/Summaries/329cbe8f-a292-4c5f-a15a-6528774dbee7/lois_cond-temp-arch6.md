# LOIS Core Programme

- Objective: On-site measurements of pH, conductivity and temperature for 13 sites in the Humber catchment and 3 sites in the Tweed catchment during 1994–1997.

- Variables and units:
  - pH (pH units)
  - Conductivity at 25C (Units = uS/cm)
  - Temperature of water (Units = Cel)

- Measurement sites (codes and locations):
  - Humber catchment: S1 Swale at Catterick Bridge; S2 Swale at Thornton Manor; U3 Ure at Boroughbridge; N4 Nidd at Skip Bridge; W5 Wharfe at Tadcaster; O6 Ouse at Clifton Bridge; D7 Derwent at Bubwith; A8 Aire at Beal Bridge; C9 Calder at Methley Bridge; D10 Don at Sprotborough Bridge; T11 Trent at Cromwell Lock; O12 Ouse at Acaster Malbis; A20 Aire at Allerton Bywater.
  - Tweed catchment: TW13 Tweed at Boleside; TW14 Tweed at Norham; TW15 Tweed at Ormiston Mill.

- Sampling design:
  - Weekly sampling across all sites.
  - Additional sampling approximately once per month per site during high-flow periods.

- How measurements were made:
  - Sample collection: using a wide-neck PTFE bottle in a plastic-covered bottle carrier; where possible lowered from bridges or immersed by hand near the main flow.
  - pH and conductivity: measured with Mettler Toledo Check Mate meters and probes.
  - Temperature: measured with a PT 100 probe and a Digitron 3204 meter.

- Data quality and calibration:
  - pH probes calibrated in the laboratory with pH 7.0 and 10.00 buffers.
  - Conductivity probes calibrated in air and with a 1417 µS KCl standard.
  - On-site drift checks with recalibration as necessary.

- Data collection protocol:
  - For each sample, three readings were taken after swirling the freshly collected sample for two minutes; the reported value is the average of the three readings.

- Personnel and provenance:
  - Measurements conducted by the field sampling team at York University.
