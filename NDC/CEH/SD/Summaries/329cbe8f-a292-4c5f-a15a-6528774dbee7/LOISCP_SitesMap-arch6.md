# HUMBER CATHCMENT

- Purpose: describes a data support approach to help others explore Humber Catchment data and obtain useful insights by finding, combining, analyzing data, and creating accessible data products for end users.

- Context and audience: aligns with roles that support a broad range of topics (e.g., local councils or private sector), assisting policy work and public data communication.

- How data support is delivered:
  - Understand the ask: clarify needs and the rationale, and determine the best approach.
  - Data discovery and verification: identify relevant datasets, seek topic expert input as needed, and assess data quality.
  - Data preparation: clean, transform, and harmonize data across formats and systems.
  - Analysis: identify patterns and significant features to inform decisions.
  - Outputs and enablement: create dashboards, pivot tables, reports, and charts; provide guidance for self-serve use.
  - Deployment and iteration: share early prototypes, gather feedback, and evolve products; advocate for better data creation.

- Data products and tools:
  - Dashboards, pivot tables, charts, and reports to enable easy access and interpretation.
  - Guidance and documentation to help end users operate and interpret the tools.

- Promotion and governance:
  - Promote outputs to increase usage and reuse.
  - Gather feedback to refine products and advocate for improvements in data creation.

- Key challenges highlighted (and implicit strategies):
  - Time required to understand the ask due to limited upfront data consideration.
  - Handling patchy data across many formats.
  - Accessing data across multiple systems.
  - Communicating complex information in a simple, accessible way.
  - Ensuring outputs are widely shared and reused.
