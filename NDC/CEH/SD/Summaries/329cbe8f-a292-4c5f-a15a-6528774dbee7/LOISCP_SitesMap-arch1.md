## Data-Driven Analysis Expectation for Humber Catchment (analyst perspective)
- If expanded, would define the catchment boundary and key questions related to hydrology, water quality, and ecosystem outcomes.
- Likely data needs:
  - Geographic boundary (GIS)
  - Hydrology: river flow, rainfall/runoff
  - Water quality metrics
  - Land use and land cover
  - Pollution sources and infrastructure
  - Governance boundaries and administrative data
  - Time-series data for trend analysis
- Data handling considerations:
  - Sourcing from multiple datasets, cleaning, and standardizing units
  - Addressing missing data and varying data quality
  - Ensuring data availability at local/catchment scale
  - Dealing with access constraints and data privacy where applicable
- Analytical approaches:
  - Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis
  - Correlation and regression analyses to identify relationships
  - Predictive modeling to assess impacts of management actions
  - Spatial analysis and mapping to show patterns and hotspots
  - Model validation with independent or held-out data
- Outputs and deliverables:
  - Charts, maps, and data-driven narratives
  - Predictive model results and scenario analysis
  - A data catalog with metadata and provenance
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Data scarcity at local or right-scale levels
  - Access barriers and complex data governance
  - Unifying data from diverse sources and formats
  - IT constraints and heavy computational requirements
  - Communicating findings effectively to decision-makers and researchers
