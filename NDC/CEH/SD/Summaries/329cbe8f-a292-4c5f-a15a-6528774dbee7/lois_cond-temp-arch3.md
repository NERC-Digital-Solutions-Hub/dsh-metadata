# LOIS Core Programme

- Overview
  - On-site measurements of pH, conductivity, and temperature across 16 sites (13 Humber catchment sites and 3 Tweed catchment sites) during 1994–1997.
  - Variables captured: pH (pH units), Conductivity at 25°C (µS/cm), Temperature (°C).
  - Spatial identifiers included: site name, user code, and National Grid Reference (NGR).

- What was measured and where
  - pH, Conductivity (25°C), and Temperature were recorded at each site.
  - Example site entries include Swale at Catterick Bridge, Thornton Manor, Ure at Boroughbridge, Nidd at Skip Bridge, Wharfe at Tadcaster, Ouse at Clifton Bridge, Derwent at Bubwith, Aire at Beal Bridge, Calder at Methley Bridge, Don at Sprotborough Bridge, Trent at Cromwell Lock, Ouse at Acaster Malbis, and Tweed sites at Boleside, Norham, Ormiston Mill.
  - Location data for each measurement included a user code and precise NGR coordinates.

- Temporal coverage and sampling design
  - Site sampling occurred at regular weekly intervals.
  - Additional sampling occurred during high-flow periods (approximately an extra sampling once per site per month).

- How measurements were made
  - Sample collection: wide-neck PTFE bottles in a plastic-covered carrier; where possible from bridges, otherwise by submerging near the main flow.
  - pH and Conductivity: measured with Mettler Toledo Check Mate meters/probes.
  - Temperature: measured with a PT 100 probe connected to a Digitron 3204 meter.

- Quality control and data quality
  - pH probes calibrated in the laboratory with pH 7.0 and 10.0 buffers; conductivity probes calibrated in air and with a 1417 µS KCl standard.
  - On-site calibration checks for drift and recalibration as needed.
  - Data quality: three readings per sample were taken after a two-minute gentle swirl, and the average of the three readings was used.

- Data provenance and who collected the data
  - Measurements conducted by the field sampling team at York University.
  - Key references documenting the LOIS river monitoring network and measurement SOPs include:
    - Leeks et al., 1997. The LOIS river monitoring network: strategy and implementation.
    - House, W.A. SOPs for conductivity and pH measurements (1993).

- Relevance for monitoring framework design
  - Demonstrates a structured protocol for aquatic chemical monitoring, including:
    - Clear variable definitions and units.
    - Detailed site-level metadata (site name, user code, NGR).
    - Regular (weekly) sampling with defined escalation during high-flow periods.
    - Standardized sampling and QA/QC procedures to ensure data comparability across sites and time.
    - Documentation of measurement equipment, calibration procedures, and data averaging methods.
  - Highlights practical considerations for governance and usability:
    - Importance of metadata completeness (site identifiers and coordinates) to enable data integration.
    - Rigorous QA/QC to maintain data quality and transparency for downstream analysis and reporting.
    - Potential data sharing needs (dataset descriptions reference to be publicly accessible) and the value of consistent data management practices for monitoring frameworks.
