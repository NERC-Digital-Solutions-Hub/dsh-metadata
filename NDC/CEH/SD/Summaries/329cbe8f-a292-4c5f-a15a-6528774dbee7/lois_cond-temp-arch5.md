# LOIS Core Programme On site measurements of pH, conductivity and temperature for 13 sites in the Humber catchment and 3 sites in the Tweed catchment within the period 1994 1997

## Dataset scope and variables
- Variables recorded: pH (units pH), Conductivity at 25C (units µS/cm), Temperature (water, units °C)
- All variables were measured at each site

## Sites and locations
- 16 measurement sites in total: 13 in the Humber catchment and 3 in the Tweed catchment
- Site codes include: S1, S2, U3, N4, W5, O6, D7, A8, C9, D10, T11, O12, TW13, TW14, TW15, A20
- Each site has a National Grid Reference (NGR) coordinate; entries indicate “Variable = All variables” for the measurements at each site

## Temporal coverage
- Sampling frequency: weekly at each site
- Additional sampling: more intermittent sampling during high flows (on average an extra sampling roughly once per site per month)

## Methods
- Sample collection: wide-neck PTFE bottle in a plastic carrier; where possible, samples taken from bridges or by immersing bottle near the main flow
- pH measurement: Mettler Toledo Check Mate meters/probes
- Conductivity measurement: Mettler Toledo Check Mate meters/probes
- Temperature measurement: PT100 probe with Digitron 3204 Pt meter

## Quality control and data quality
- pH calibration: laboratory buffers at pH 7.0 and 10.00
- Conductivity calibration: calibrated in air and with 1417 µS KCl standard
- On-site checks: calibration drift checked and recalibrated if necessary
- Data quality: for each sample, three readings were taken and the average used
- Field protocol references: SOPs for pH and conductivity measurements; field team calibration and measurement procedures described

## Data provenance and stewardship
- Measurements conducted by the field sampling team at York University
- References documenting the LOIS river monitoring network strategy and the SOPs for field measurements
- Data are tied to site identifiers, exact locations (NGR), and the measurement variables/units, enabling discovery and reuse within broader water quality datasets
