# HUMBER CATHCMENT

## Aim
- Ensure the organisation is working effectively with data.

## Who they are
- Hold management roles focused on implementing an effective data strategy.
- Apply past data analysis knowledge to the organisational data function.
- Consider how data serves a wider community and may work across networks of partners.

## How they meet their aims
- Think about the whole data system.
- Understand user needs (e.g., policy colleagues) as an ongoing process, potentially encouraging 'co-ownership' of data products.
- Understand what data is available and where gaps are, verifying data suitability to prioritise efforts.
- Find data through platforms, online searches, and reaching out to others.
- Commission new data and think creatively about data gathering.
- Support good analytical, presentation, and dissemination practices within their team.
- Ensure data assets are managed correctly (format, quality, metadata, discoverability, updates).
- Ensure products meet user needs through feedback and iteration.
- May collaborate with the wider data community to support an effective system.

## Particular Challenges
- Understanding user needs, especially for diverse public audiences.
- Getting an overview of available data due to its scattered nature.
- Lack of data, particularly at the required granularity.
- Paywalls and data protection barriers hindering access.
- Difficulty quickly verifying data content and format.
- Lack of data standards, variable data quality, and unclear metadata.
- Lack of coordination in the sector, duplicated effort, and interest in stronger communities of practice.
