# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

## Overview
- Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest (North East Wales) using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming for the upland moorland ecosystem over the next 20–30 years.
- Established in 1998 with replicated drought and warming treatments plus controls; powered by solar and wind.
- Target ecosystem includes Calluna vulgaris (dominant), Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum and a bryophyte-rich understory; soil is humo-ferric podzol.

## Climate change treatment information
- Treatments and replication:
  - Drought: 3 replicate plots (4 m x 5 m) + 3 control plots with shading mirrors (n=9 total).
  - Warming: 3 replicate plots with retractable aluminum curtains; night-time warming with infrared reflectance; rain is intermittently excluded by a rainfall-detection mechanism.
- Temporal details:
  - Drought operated annually May–September (1999–2011); since 2012, April–October.
  - Warming implemented progressively; adjustments made for rainfall exclusion during rain events.
- Operational safeguards:
  - Curtains not used in high winds (>10 m/s) to prevent damage.
  - Some rainfall may be excluded during warm periods due to roof retraction timing.

## Site characteristics
- Location: Clocaenog Forest, grid SJ019519; coordinates 53.055°N, -3.465°W.
- Environment: upland wet heath/moorland with Calluna-dominated vegetation; growing season June–August; winter dormancy.
- Soils: humo-ferric podzol with variable E and Bh horizons (E typically 6–17 cm depth when present).

## Data collection and datasets
- A diverse, long-term data program collects abiotic and biotic variables. Datasets include:
  - AWS meteorological data (daily, 1999–present): air temp, humidity, rainfall, wind, solar/ PAR, net radiation, pressure; data logged hourly from a 4 m mast.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data (daily, 1998–2015): soil/air temperature, soil moisture (various methods over time).
  - Storage rain gauge data and rainfall chemistry (biweekly): site-level rainfall; chemical analyses of collected rainfall (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium).
  - Throughfall data (plot-level, biweekly): plot rainfall collected per treatment; used with site rainfall to derive treatment-specific rainfall changes.
  - Water table depth (from 2009 onward): permeable tubes; biweekly measurements.
  - Soil respiration (fortnightly and automated, 1999–2015): CO2 efflux measured with collar-based chambers; multiple sensor systems over time.
  - Trace gases CH4 and N2O (1999–2000, 2007–2009): static chambers; GC analysis.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) (2002–2004, 2011): chamber-based CO2 flux, with both light/dark (for respiration) adjustments in later years.
  - Photosynthesis (2001–2003): leaf-level measurements with CIRAS; light response curves.
  - Vegetation biomass (pin-point canopy surveys, 1998–2012 with gaps): biomass estimates converted from pin hits using species-specific calibration; three fixed quadrats per plot.
  - Canopy reflectance (2000–2004): ground-based spectrometer; NDVI and PRI indices.
  - Vegetation phenology, annual growth and pathogens (1998–present): budburst, shoot elongation, leaf counts, signs of herbivory and disease.
  - Vegetation chemistry (1998–present): leaf and litter chemistry (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates).
  - Litterfall (1998–2009): monthly-to-yearly collections; drying and weighing; C and N analyses.
  - Root biomass (2003–2013): soil cores and root extraction; multiple years and methods.
  - Soil microbial biomass (2000–2001, 2012): chloroform fumigation technique; DOC analyses.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation (1998–2004): incubation cores; NH4+/NO3 analyses.
  - SOM/SOC and bulk density (1999–2004, 2013): core-based measurements; organic/inorganic separation; bulk density calculations.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry (1998–2008): lysimeters and tension samplers; pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium analyses.
- Dataset names and basic metadata are listed for each category; some smaller or post-2015 datasets may not be stored in the main data portal.
- Appendix: Site and plot layout information for reference.

## Data processing, QA and provenance
- Data are generated from a mix of instruments and methods with conversions necessary to compare across years and measurement systems (e.g., soil respiration units, NEE conversions).
- Data quality control:
  - On-site visual QA for AWS and micro-met data; opportunities for manual interpretation beyond automated checks.
  - Throughfall data includes data-loss handling (plot-level exclusions when collectors fail) and occasional infilling with average reductions.
  - Legacy data note: processing steps may not align with current best practices; contact data contacts for clarification.
- Calibration and biomass adjustments:
  - NEE and photosynthesis adjustments account for plot biomass differences using biomass measurements and calibration factors from pin-point biomass data.

## Storage, access and use
- Data are stored across multiple systems; not all data are stored in the EIDC (Environmental Information Data Centre) or CEH Bangor portals.
- For access or detailed data queries, contact CEH Bangor staff: Sabine Reinsch (sabrei@ceh.ac.uk) or Bridget Emmett (bae@ceh.ac.uk).
