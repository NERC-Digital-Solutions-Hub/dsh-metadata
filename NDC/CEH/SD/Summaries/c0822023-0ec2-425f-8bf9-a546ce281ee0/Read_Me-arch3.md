# Clocaenog supporting documentation: Fortnightly soil respiration data series and data structure

- Overview
  - The document references two supporting materials for the Clocaenog Fortnightly soil respiration data series:
    - Clocaenog_supporting_documentation_Data series.rtf — Supporting documentation for the data series.
    - SD_Fortnightly_soil_respiration_Clocaenog.rtf — Details of data structure.

- Key contents and purpose
  - Providing context and guidance for the data series (metadata, provenance, methods) through the supporting documentation.
  - Describing the data structure (schema, variables, data types) to enable proper use, interpretation, and integration with other datasets.

- Relevance to Authors of Monitoring Frameworks
  - Supports building robust monitoring frameworks by supplying essential metadata and a clear data structure for a fortnightly soil respiration indicator.
  - Facilitates data quality assurance, reproducibility, and governance through documented data provenance and structure.

- Implications for implementation
  - Useful for ensuring consistent metadata standards, data management, and transparency when sharing or publishing the data.
  - Aids in aligning the dataset with other environmental health indicators and monitoring outputs.

- Suggested next steps for governance and use
  - Review and validate metadata against data governance requirements (ownership, access, versioning).
  - Assess the data structure details to ensure compatibility with existing dashboards, reports, or integration pipelines.
  - Plan for data sharing and documentation updates to maintain openness while meeting governance constraints.
