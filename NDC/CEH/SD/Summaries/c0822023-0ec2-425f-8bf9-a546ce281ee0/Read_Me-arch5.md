- SD_Fortnightly_soil_respiration_Clocaenog.rtf: provides details of the data structure for the fortnightly soil respiration dataset.

## Data stewardship implications
- Indicates presence of metadata and a defined data structure that should be maintained for discovery and reuse.
- Metadata and data structure documentation are essential for data governance, provenance, and interoperability.
- Documentation should cover definitions, units, sampling methodology, data formats, and any data constraints or access restrictions.

## Recommended next steps for maintainers
- Review and verify the completeness and accuracy of the supporting documentation and the data structure details.
- Ensure alignment between the data files and their metadata (variables, units, time stamps, methods).
- Document data provenance, versioning, update cadence, and any embargo or access controls.
- Upload or register datasets and their documentation in the appropriate data catalog or portal, maintaining clear links between the data and its documentation.

## Potential governance considerations
- Maintain consistency across systems and formats; address any interoperability issues.
- Plan for ongoing updates and revisions to metadata and structure documentation as the dataset evolves.
