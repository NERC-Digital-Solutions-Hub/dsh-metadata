# Fortnightly soil respiration_Clocaenog.csv

## Overview
- Supplement to supporting documentation for data series.
- Dataset tracks fortnightly soil respiration across plots under climate treatment.

## Data structure
- 11 columns: Date, Method, and soil respiration values for nine plots (1–9).
- The first data row lists the plot numbers 1–9; the second row contains the climate treatment; the Method column records the measurement method.

## Timeframe
- Data range from 30/03/1999 to 30/06/2015.
- Empty cells indicate missing data for that date.

## Metadata and data quality
- Documentation highlights metadata considerations and potential need to verify data origins; gaps or inconsistencies may require data-originator input and transformation.

## Relevance for monitoring and policy
- Supports long-term monitoring of soil respiration under different climate treatments.
- Enables trend analysis and cross-plot comparisons to inform environmental health evaluations and policy decisions.

## Data governance implications
- Emphasizes data provenance, openness, and standardization; sharing underlying data should follow appropriate governance and quality controls.

## Gaps and considerations
- Data gaps exist (missing entries); consider imputation strategies or clear documentation of missing periods.
- Ensure consistent measurement methods and contextual metadata across the time span.

## Next steps for data stewards
- Standardize and document units, protocols, and treatment codes.
- Verify and capture origin metadata; ensure data accessibility and versioning.
- Implement quality checks and clear data governance for ongoing updates.
