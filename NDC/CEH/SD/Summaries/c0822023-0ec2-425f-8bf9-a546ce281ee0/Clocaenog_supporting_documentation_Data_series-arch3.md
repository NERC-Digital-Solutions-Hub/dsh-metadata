# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

## Purpose and scope
- Documentation of the Climoor climate change manipulation experiment data collected at the Clocaenog field site.
- Focuses on drought and warming treatments and the wide range of abiotic and biotic measurements used to monitor environmental health, ecosystem structure, and function.
- Data are intended to scrutinise policy-relevant environmental health indicators and inform future decision-making; notes on data accessibility and governance are included.

## Site information and context
- Location: Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, upland west-atlantic moorland.
- Ecosystem: Heather-dominated wet upland heath (Calluna vulgaris) with Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum, and associated bryophytes; normal growing season June–August; dormant November–February.
- Soil: Humo-ferric podzol with variable eluvial (E) and illuvial (Bh) horizons; parent material Ordovician/Silurian shale or mudstone.
- Site established: 1998; remote, solar/wind powered, automated roof climate manipulation system.
- Plant and soil measurements span multiple years and layers (vegetation, soil, litter, roots, microbial biomass, soil chemistry, etc.).

## Climate change treatments

### Drought
- Structure: Three replicates of drought plots and three control plots per block, total of nine plots.
- Timing: May–September droughts (1999–2011); since 2012, April–October.
- Mechanism: Retractable polyethylene roof that excludes rainfall during drought periods; typical ~20% reduction in annual rainfall and up to ~80% exclusion of rainfall during treatment windows.
- Context: Drought timing and intensity aligned with UK drought patterns (e.g., 1995 drought reference).

### Warming
- Structure: Replicates with warming treatment curtains (aluminium mesh) over plots to reduce heat loss at night.
- Mechanism: Curtains retract automatically in response to light, and retractor timing is coordinated with rain to minimize rainfall exclusion.
- Effect: Reduces nighttime heat loss (high infrared reflectivity) and influences local temperature regime; warming represented in growing degree days (GDD) data with year-to-year variability (changes in GDD ranging from small declines to moderate increases across years).

## Equipment, protocols and data processing methodology

- On-site automated weather station (AWS) and a suite of plot-based sensors (micro-met data) plus a broad set of abiotic/biotic measurements.
- Data collection cadence: typically daily for meteorological variables; higher-frequency measurements for some soil and atmospheric processes.
- Data types and data streams (examples):
  - AWS meteorological data: variables include air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, air pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind speed/direction; data from 1999–present.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: soil/air temperature and soil moisture; daily measurements (1998–present).
  - Rainfall: storage rain gauge (biweekly) and rainfall chemistry (biweekly samples for pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium) since 1998–present.
  - Throughfall data: plot-level rainfall measurements (biweekly); used to derive treatment-specific rainfall adjustments.
  - Water table depth: measured biweekly from 2009; tubes to bedrock.
  - Soil respiration: both fortnightly field measurements and automated campaigns (2013–2014 onward) using soil collars and CO2 flux measurements.
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): measured with static chambers; data from 1999–2000 and 2007–2009.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): measured in 2002–2004 and 2009–2011 using chamber systems; methods varied by year.
  - Photosynthesis: infrequent measurements (2001–2003; 2001 for some species) with CIRAS-2 and leaf cuvettes.
  - Vegetation biomass (Pin-point method): annual surveys across multiple years (1998–2012, and thereafter in some years).
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometry (2000–2001, 2003–2004).
  - Vegetation phenology, growth and pathogens: annual measurements (1998–present); registering budburst, shoot elongation, leaf emergence, and pathogen signs.
  - Vegetation chemistry: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates; conducted on green and senesced material.
  - Litterfall: monthly sampling (1999–2002) with subsequent pooling and conversion to g m^-2.
  - Root biomass: multiple years (2003–2004, 2008, 2011) using soil cores and diverse extraction methods.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation-extraction (2000, 2001, 2012).
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: soil-core incubations with KCl extraction (1998–2004).
  - SOM, SOC and bulk density: soil cores with SOC/SOM quantification and bulk density calculations (1999–2004, 2013).
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and suction samplers; monthly sampling (1998–2008).
- Data management and processing notes:
  - Multiple instruments and methods over time; unit conversions provided for CO2 fluxes (g CO2 m^-2 h^-1 and µmol m^-2 s^-1 to mg C m^-2 h^-1).
  - Legacy data notes: some data processing steps not always documented to current best practices.
  - Data may reside outside central repositories (not all data stored in EIDC); some smaller or infrequent data may require direct contact for access.
- Documentation and contacts:
  - Primary data access/engineering contacts: Sabine Reinsch (sabrei@ceh.ac.uk) and Bridget Emmett (bae@ceh.ac.uk) at CEH Bangor.

## Data accessibility and governance

- The dataset compilation notes that not all data are stored in the EIDC (Environmental Information Data Centre); smaller, infrequent, or post-2015 data may be outside central repositories.
- Data quality control methods have included both automated and manual checks; some legacy data have been processed with methods that may not meet current standard practices.
- To access or clarify datasets, contact the CEH Bangor coordinators listed above.

## Key challenges and considerations for monitoring frameworks

- Data gaps and incompleteness:
  - Throughfall and plot-level rainfall data require careful adjustment to derive treatment-specific rainfall; data losses can affect treatment means.
  - Some measurements (e.g., trace gases, NEE) have gaps across years and varying measurement methodologies.
- Metadata and data provenance:
  - Inconsistent or evolving measurement protocols across years complicate cross-year comparisons.
  - Legacy data documentation may be incomplete; some datasets require direct liaison with data custodians for full metadata and calibration details.
- Data accessibility:
  - Not all data are centralized in a single repository; some files are stored locally or require direct contact for access.
- Data governance and openness:
  - While there is a push to share underlying data, some datasets may face barriers related to metadata completeness, data format transformations, or governance constraints.
- Data quality and transformation:
  - Raw data come from diverse instrument types and units; conversions and calibrations are required, with explicit conversion factors provided for CO2 fluxes.
- Reproducibility and policy relevance:
  - The extensive suite of measurements provides a broad basis for environmental health indicators (meteorology, soil biogeochemistry, vegetation dynamics, and ecosystem fluxes), enabling policy-relevant assessments of climate change manipulation effects on upland moorland ecosystems.
