# Materials and methods

- Data content: Collated data on calcium and magnesium (mg/kg DM) in plants used as human and animal food (including fruit, vegetables, grasses, nuts and seeds) from global literature published 1982–2019; where reported, strontium values are included.
- Units and water content handling: Presented in milligrams per kilogram dry mass (mg/kg DM). If water content had already been accounted for in the published data, the water_content_% column is n/a. If not, the water content percentage is provided and applied to the data.
- References: Each data point is referenced and a full list of references is provided.

## Data structure and metadata

- Columns:
  - Food_Name: Food name as it appears in the base data.
  - Food_Name, Units: n/a.
  - Water_content_%: Percentage water content of the food.
  - Calcium_mg/kgDM: Calcium content in food.
  - Magnesium_mg/ kgDM: Magnesium content in food.
  - Strontium_mg/kgDM: Strontium content in food (if reported).
  - Reference: Brief reference appearing in full in the supporting file.
- Notes: n/a in the data means data were not available.
- Acknowledgement: The dataset was compiled as an activity within the CONFIDENCE project, part of the CONCERT project, which received funding from the Euratom Research and Training programme (2014–2018) under grant agreement No 662287.
