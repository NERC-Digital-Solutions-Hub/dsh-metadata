# Materials and methods.

- Scope and content
  - Dataset collates calcium and magnesium (mg/kg DM) in plants used as human and animal food (including fruit, vegetables, grasses, nuts, seeds) from global literature published 1982–2019.
  - Where reported, strontium values are also included.
  - Data are presented in milligrams per kilogram dry mass.

- Water content handling
  - If water content was already accounted for in the published data, the water_content_% column is n/a.
  - If water content was not accounted for, the percentage water content is provided and applied to the data.

- Data structure and variables
  - Food_Name: food name as it appears in the base data.
  - Water_content_%: percentage water content of the food.
  - Calcium_mg/kgDM: calcium content (mg/kg dry mass).
  - Magnesium_mg/kgDM: magnesium content (mg/kg dry mass).
  - Strontium_mg/kgDM: strontium content (mg/kg dry mass).
  - Reference: brief reference for each data point (full reference listed in accompanying file).

- Data provenance
  - Each data point is referenced; a full list of references is provided.
  - Notes: n/a in the data indicates data were not available.

- Acknowledgement and funding
