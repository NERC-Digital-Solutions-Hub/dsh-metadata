# Materials and methods.

## Overview
- Collated data on calcium and magnesium (mg/kg DM) in plants used as human and animal food, including fruit, vegetables, grasses, nuts and seeds, from global literature published 1982–2019.
- Where reported, strontium values are included.
- Data presented in milligrams per kilogram dry mass; water content handling described (water_content_% is n/a if water content was already accounted for; otherwise water content is provided and applied).

## Data scope
- Foods studied: plants used as human and animal food (fruit, vegetables, grasses, nuts, seeds).
- Additional element: strontium included where available.

## Data handling and structure
- Each data point is referenced; a full list of references is provided.
- Water content: if not accounted for in published data, the provided water_content_% is applied to standardize to mg/kg DM.
- All measurements reported as Calcium_mg/kgDM, Magnesium_mg/kgDM, and Strontium_mg/kgDM (where applicable).
- Notes: n/a in the data indicates data were not available.

## Column explanations
- Food_Name: food name as it appears in base data.
- Food_Name, Units: not applicable (n/a).
- Water_content_%: percentage water content of the food.
- Calcium_mg/kgDM: calcium content (mg/kg dry mass).
- Magnesium_mg/kgDM: magnesium content (mg/kg dry mass).
- Strontium_mg/kgDM: strontium content (mg/kg dry mass).
- Reference: brief reference; full citation listed in the references section.
- Reference, Units: n/a.

## Notes
- n/a in the data means data were not available.
