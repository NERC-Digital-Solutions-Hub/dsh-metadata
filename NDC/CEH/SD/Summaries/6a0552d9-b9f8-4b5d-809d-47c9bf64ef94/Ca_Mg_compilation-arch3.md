# Materials and methods.

- Scope and purpose
  - Collated data on calcium and magnesium (mg/kg DM) in plants used as human and animal food (including fruit, vegetables, grasses, nuts and seeds) from global literature published between 1982 and 2019.
  - Where reported, strontium values are included.

- Units and data handling
  - Data presented in milligrams per kilogram dry mass (mg/kg DM).
  - If water content had already been accounted for in the published data, the water_content_% field is n/a.
  - If water content was not accounted for, the percentage water content is provided and applied to normalize to dry mass.

- Data points and provenance
  - Each data point is referenced, with a full list of references provided in the accompanying material.
  - Column headings and data meanings are defined (Food_Name, Water_content_%, Calcium_mg/kgDM, Magnesium_mg/kgDM, Strontium_mg/kgDM, Reference).

- Data sources and references
  - Includes diverse sources such as AUSNUT (Australian Food, Supplement and Nutrient Database) and FAO/INFOODS databases, among others.
  - Acknowledges specific datasets and studies cited (e.g., UK/Spain crop data, pulses databases, national nutrient files, etc.).

- Data governance and transparency
  - The dataset emphasizes traceability by linking each data point to its reference.
  - Notes indicate data gaps are possible (n/a indicates data not available for that field).

- Acknowledgement and funding
  - Compiled as part of the CONFIDENCE project within the CONCERT project.
  - CONCERT funded by the Euratom Research and Training programme (2014-2018), grant No 662287.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates systematic collection, standardization to dry mass, and rigorous provenance for environmental health monitoring.
  - Highlights the importance of metadata (water content handling) and transparent data sources to support policy scrutiny and decision-making.
