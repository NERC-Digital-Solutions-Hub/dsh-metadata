# Materials and methods.

- The dataset collates calcium and magnesium concentrations (mg/kg DM) in plants used as human and animal food, including fruit, vegetables, grasses, nuts and seeds, from global literature published between 1982 and 2019. Where reported, strontium values are included as well.
- Mineral contents are presented in milligrams per kilogram of dry mass (mg/kg DM). If water content had already been accounted for in the published data, the Water_content_% field is marked as n/a; otherwise, the provided water content percentage is used to convert values to dry mass.
- Each data point is referenced, and a full list of references is provided below.
- Column headings and their meanings:
  - Food_Name: Food name as it appears in the base data.
  - Water_content_%: Percentage water content of the food (if applicable).
  - Calcium_mg/kgDM: Calcium content (mg/kg dry mass).
  - Magnesium_mg/kgDM: Magnesium content (mg/kg dry mass).
  - Strontium_mg/kgDM: Strontium content (mg/kg dry mass).
  - Reference: Brief reference as cited in the dataset (full details provided in the references section).
- Notes: Data fields marked with n/a indicate data were not available.
- Acknowledgement: The dataset was compiled as an activity within the CONFIDENCE project, part of the CONCERT project, which received funding from the Euratom Research and Training programme (2014-2018) under grant agreement No 662287.
