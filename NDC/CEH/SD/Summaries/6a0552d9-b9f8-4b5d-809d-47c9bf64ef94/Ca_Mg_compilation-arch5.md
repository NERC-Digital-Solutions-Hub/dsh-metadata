# Materials and methods.

## Data scope and content
- Collated data on calcium and magnesium (mg/kg DM) in plants used as human and animal food (including fruit, vegetables, grasses, nuts and seeds) from global literature published 1982–2019.
- Where reported, strontium values are also included.
- Data are presented in milligrams per kilogram dry mass (mg/kg DM).
- If water content had already been accounted for in the published data, the water_content_% column is n/a; otherwise, the percentage water content is provided and applied to the data.
- Each data point is referenced, and a full list of references is provided.

## Data structure and column definitions
- Food_Name: Food name as it appears in the base data.
- Food_Name, Units: not applicable (n/a).
- Water_content_%, Explanation: Percentage water content of the food.
- Water_content_%, Units: percent.
- Calcium_mg/kgDM, Explanation: Calcium content in food.
- Calcium_mg/kgDM, Units: Milligrams per kilogram dry mass.
- Magnesium_mg/kgDM, Explanation: Magnesium content in food.
- Magnesium_mg/kgDM, Units: Milligrams per kilogram dry mass.
- Strontium_mg/kgDM, Explanation: Strontium content in food.
- Strontium_mg/kgDM, Units: Milligrams per kilogram dry mass.
- Reference, Explanation: Brief reference cited for the data point.
- Reference, Units: n/a.
- Notes: n/a in the data means data were not available.

## Provenance and references
- Every data point is tied to a reference; a full set of references is provided.
- References encompass diverse databases and publications (e.g., AUSNUT, FAO/INFOODS, UK/Spain crop data, and other national or regional food composition datasets) listed in the document.
- Acknowledges the dataset as part of a larger project activity and provides source citations for traceability.

## Data processing and quality considerations
- Data are harmonized to a common unit (mg/kg DM) and adjusted for water content when needed, as described.
- Metadata and column definitions are clearly documented to facilitate interoperability and reuse.
- The document notes the presence of non-available data via n/a indicators, indicating gaps in coverage for certain elements or foods.
- No explicit, section-specific QA procedures are detailed beyond the general emphasis on referencing and harmonization.

## Governance, availability, and maintenance
- The dataset is documented with provenance (references) and a formal acknowledgement of funding and project affiliation.
- While licensing details are not specified in the excerpt, the dataset is positioned within a formal research project (CONFIDENCE/CONCERT) with funding acknowledgment, suggesting a structured approach to data stewardship and potential future updates.

## Acknowledgement and funding
- Compiled as an activity within the CONFIDENCE project, part of the CONCERT project.
- CONCERT project received funding from the Euratom Research and Training programme (2014–2018) under grant agreement No 662287.
