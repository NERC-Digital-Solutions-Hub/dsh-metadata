# Materials and methods.

## Overview
- Compiled dataset of calcium and magnesium (mg/kg DM) in foods used for human and animal consumption, including fruit, vegetables, grasses, nuts, and seeds.
- Global literature coverage from 1982 to 2019; strontium values included where reported.
- Data expressed in milligrams per kilogram dry mass (mg/kg DM).
- Water content handling: if water content was not already accounted in published data, water_content_% is provided and applied; otherwise water_content_% is recorded as n/a.
- Each data point is reference-backed with a full list of references provided.

## Data structure and variables
- Food_Name: Food name as it appears in the base data.
- Water_content_%: Percentage water content of the food (percent).
- Calcium_mg/kgDM: Calcium content in mg/kg dry mass.
- Magnesium_mg/kgDM: Magnesium content in mg/kg dry mass.
- Strontium_mg/kgDM: Strontium content in mg/kg dry mass (if reported).
- Reference: Brief reference for the data point (linked to full references list).
- Notes: Indicates data gaps (n/a when data were not available).

## Data handling and processing
- Data are collated from diverse global sources and standardized to mg/kg DM.
- Water content adjustments are applied when not already accounted in the original data.
- All data points include a provenance reference; notes clarify missing values (n/a).

## Provenance and acknowledgement
- Dataset compiled as part of the CONFIDENCE project within the CONCERT project.
- CONCERT project funded by the Euratom Research and Training programme (2014-2018) under grant agreement No 662287.
- References include AUSNUT, UK/Spain crop data, FAO/INFOODS databases, and multiple national and regional nutrient databases.

## References and data provenance
- Comprehensive list of references provided for traceability, including international food composition datasets and specific studies across multiple countries and foods.
