# Brief description of the dataset

- Weekly water quality monitoring data for eight River Thames sites and sixteen major tributaries, covering March 2009 to December 2023.
- Parameters measured include phosphorus and nitrogen species, dissolved reactive silicon, water temperature, pH, Gran alkalinity, suspended solids, chlorophyll, major dissolved anions (fluoride, chloride, bromide, sulfate), major cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg, B) (2009–2016), and dissolved/total iron, manganese, zinc, copper (2010–2013).
- Sampling conducted as part of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology’s Thames Initiative monitoring programme.
- Missing data shown as blanks; samples below detection limits marked nd (not detectable).

## Collection and generation

- Bulk river samples collected weekly (Monday or Tuesday) from the main flow of each site.
- Field measurements (water temperature, pH, conductivity, redox potential) taken in the field from March 2013 to present.
- Dissolved oxygen measured in the field after sampling (since July 2018).
- Subsamples filtered in the field (0.45 μm) and returned to the laboratory for analysis.
- Samples stored in the dark at 4°C prior to analysis.

## Analytical methods

- pH measured in the laboratory with a calibrated pH meter.
- Gran alkalinity determined by acidimetric titration to pH 4 and 3.
- Suspended solids quantified by filtration and gravimetric drying.
- Chlorophyll a measured colorimetrically after acetone extraction.
- Total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) determined by acidified persulfate digestion and colorimetric detection.
- Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) measured by phosphomolybdate blue method.
- Dissolved reactive silicon quantified via molybdate method with reduction to form silicomolybdenum blues.
- Ammonium measured by indophenol-blue colorimetric method.
- Dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen analyzed by Thermalox or Elementar Vario Cube analyzers.
- Major dissolved anions measured by ion chromatography; total and dissolved cations by ICP-OES after acidification.
- Most analyses performed with reference QC standards (Aquacheck, except for suspended solids).

## Data and units

- Date/time recorded as day/month/year; sampling time in hour:minute format.
- Concentrations reported in: TP, TDP, SRP (μg P/L); dissolved/total phosphorus (μg P/L); dissolved reactive silicon (mg Si/L); ammonium (mg NH4/L); chlorophyll a (μg/L); major ions (various mg/L or μg/L); temperature (°C); pH (dimensionless); Gran alkalinity (μeq/L); suspended solids (mg/L); conductivity (μS/cm); dissolved oxygen (% saturation and mg/L); other metals (μg/L to mg/L as appropriate).
- Data include both unfiltered (total) and filtered (dissolved) measurements where applicable.

## Quality control and data handling

- Analyses (except suspended solids) performed with reference Aquacheck QC standards.
- Data presented in site-ordered then date-ordered format.
- Missing data explicitly indicated; some data below detection limits marked as nd.
- Most sites linked to nearby Environment Agency gauging stations; mean daily river flow data available from the National River Flow Archive.

## Relevance for analysts monitoring the environment

- Provides a standardized, long-term dataset suitable for assessing temporal trends in river water quality and compliance with standards.
- Uses established, well-documented analytical methods enabling comparability with other monitoring efforts.
- QC frameworks and clear data formatting support integration into broader environmental health assessments and policy performance analyses.
- The dataset’s structure (site-first, date-second) facilitates cross-site comparisons and time-series analyses.
