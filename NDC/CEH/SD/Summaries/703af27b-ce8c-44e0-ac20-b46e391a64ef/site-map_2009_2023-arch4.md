- Data governance and quality implications
  - No metadata is provided (coordinates, data type, units, frequency, ownership, or data source).
  - Lacks a centralized data catalog, data dictionary, or standardized naming conventions.
  - Unknown data access conditions and update cadence.

- Opportunities for Data Leaders
  - Create a centralized metadata registry linking each site code to coordinates, measurement types, units, frequency, ownership, and data quality.
  - Standardize site naming and ensure consistent metadata across all entries.
  - Establish data-sharing agreements and clear data access pathways across partners.
  - Align inventory with user needs (policy colleagues, researchers) to enable co-ownership of data products and improve discoverability.

- Recommended next steps
  - Develop a data dictionary and metadata schema for all site entries.
  - Attach coordinates, data types, units, cadence, and custodians to each site.
  - Publish the inventory in a discoverable data portal with an update schedule.
  - Integrate with existing data standards and encourage cross-partner collaboration for data quality and coverage.
