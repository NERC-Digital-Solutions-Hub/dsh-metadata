# Site codes and site names for river monitoring locations

- The document lists two-letter site codes paired with human-readable site names and locations, covering multiple river monitoring sites.
- Each entry follows the pattern: "<code>, Site name = <Site name and location>."
- Examples of included sites:
  - Tm, Thame at Wheatley
  - Ra, Ray at Islip
  - Ch, Cherwell at Hampton Poyle
  - Ev, Evenlode at Cassington Mill
  - TS, Thames at Swinford
  - TN, Thames at Newbridge
  - Wi, Windrush at Newbridge
  - Le, Leach at Lechlade (Mill Lane)
  - Cl, Cole at Lynt Bridge
  - Cn, Coln at Whelford
  - Oc, Ock at Abingdon
  - Pa, Pang at Tidmarsh
  - TSo, Thames at Sonning
  - Lo, Lodden at Charvil
  - TR, Thames at Runnymede
  - Wy, Wye at Bourne End
  - TW, Thames at Wallingford
  - TH, Thames at Hannington Wick
  - Ke, Kennet at Woolhampton
  - En, Emborne at Brimpton
  - Ju, Jubilee River at Pocock's Bridge
  - TT, Thames at Taplow
  - TG, Thames at Goring
  - Cs, Colne at Staines
- Rivers represented include Thames, Ock, Cherwell, Evenlode, Windrush, Leach, Cole, Coln, Pang, Lodden, Wye, Kennet, Emborne, and Jubilee River, indicating a broad geographic scope across southern England.

- Data governance implications for Data Stewards:
  - Data model needs: a stable site_code, full site_name with location, river name, and potentially coordinates.
  - Metadata improvements to consider: coordinates (lat/long), data type (e.g., hydrological, chemical), data ownership, collection dates, and data-sharing permissions.
  - Standardization opportunities: ensure consistent naming conventions, unify river names, and maintain a canonical gazetteer to prevent duplicates or aliasing.
  - Data quality considerations: verify uniqueness of codes, validate site names, capture changes over time (site renames, relocations, or removals).
  - Data integration steps: map to a standardized schema (site_code, site_name, river, location, lat/long, data_type, steward), and catalog in appropriate data portals with versioning.
  - Operational considerations: establish update workflows, provenance, and documentation of any embargoes or access restrictions.
