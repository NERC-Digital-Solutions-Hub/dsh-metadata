# Materials and methods for the dataset: Growth of five species of trees on experimental plots on sand tailings left after mining for rutile in Sierra Leone.

- Context and aim
  - Study on tree growth on sand tailings from rutile mining in Sierra Leone, where soils are extremely nutrient-poor (low nitrogen ~0.0027%, carbon ~0.073%) and natural regeneration is minimal.
  - Eight experimental plots (Lanti South) with four 25 m × 25 m compartments each, planted in 2007 to evaluate establishment under different planting and surface treatments.
  - Focus on growth response of five species and potential interactions with soil and surface amendments; data intended for analysis of treatment effects, species performance, and potential environmental rehabilitation insights.

- Experimental design
  - Plots: 8 total (plots 1–4 square, plots 5–8 rectangular); each plot subdivided into four compartments.
  - Compartments: 25 m × 25 m; four compartments per plot.
  - Species: five per compartment, one species per row
    - Mango (Mangifera indica)
    - Gmelina arborea
    - Cashew (Anacardium occidentale)
    - Citrus sinensis (sweet orange; some variation possible)
    - Monkey apple (Anisophyllea laurina)
  - Planting treatments (per compartment): 
    - 17 L compost
    - 17 L topsoil
    - 17 L 50:50 mix of compost and topsoil
    - Control (no added material)
  - Surface treatments (applied to entire compartment per plot):
    - ~2 cm compost
    - ~2 cm topsoil
    - ~5 cm mulch
    - Control (no surface treatment)

- Data collected and dataset structure
  - Primary outcome: tree height measured in centimeters after 2.5 years (June 2007 – November 2009).
  - Dataset file: rutile_experiements_tree_hts.csv
    - Size: ~42 KB
    - Format: comma-delimited ASCII; first line contains variable names
    - Records: 800 trees (across 8 plots × 4 compartments × 5 trees per compartment)
    - Columns (described in Table 3): id, Plot, Planting, Surface, position, Species, Height
      - id: unique integer (1–800)
      - Plot: integer (1–8)
      - Planting: string (compost, control, ts_and_c, topsoil)
      - Surface: string (topsoil_surf, nothing_surf, compost_surf, mulch_surf)
      - position: integer (1–5) indicating position along the row
      - Species: string (Mangifera, Gmelina, Anisophyllea, Anacardium, Citrus)
      - Height: integer, cm (0 indicates dead or missing)
  - Additional measurements and samples collected (not part of the height file but described):
    - Soil samples: carbon and nitrogen (June 2007 pre-planting; January 2009) and heavy metals tests (2009)
    - Biodiversity indicators: invertebrates, birds, ground flora
  - Data collection and entry
    - Field measurements with tape measures; recordings made on paper then transcribed to Excel
    - Data entry involved double-entry verification by two-person teams (measurer and recorder)

- Data collection context and QA
  - Field procedures
    - Trees measured from ground to the highest apical bud; attempt to ensure vertical alignment during measurement
    - Dead or missing trees recorded as height zero
    - Planting treatments and plot assignments cross-checked with location maps; surface treatments clearly visible
  - Site and environment
    - Lanti South sand tailings with coarse quartz sand; poor drainage and high rainfall (≈3 m/year)
    - Plot maintenance largely performed by mining company; local community-sourced compost used in some plots
    - Some plots experienced weed/seeds from decentralized compost leading to undergrowth
  - Quality control observations
    - Some signboards marking plots disappeared or relocated; tall trees became difficult to measure accurately with simple tapes
    - Cross-checks conducted to align planting treatments with plot maps
    - No missing data reported in the id/Plot/Planting/Surface/position/Species/Height fields; some trees recorded as dead or missing (height = 0)

- Site description and context (highlights relevant to data interpretation)
  - Location: Lanti South, near 7°41' N, 12°17' W; adjacent to active dredge ponds; large nearby mangrove forest
  - Environment: ultra-coarse sand tailings with minimal natural regeneration; rainfall concentrated in August; all plots on two sand tailing ridges separated by a shallow, seasonally flooded valley
  - History: rutile mining since the 1970s; rehabilitation plots established in 1994 onward; planting commenced June 2007
  - Climate and soils: sandy substrate with very low nutrients; risk of high leaching; soils markedly degraded from pre-disturbance conditions

- Practical notes for analysts
  - Data scope: height as primary response; potential secondary analyses include growth rate by species, treatment effects, interactions between planting and surface treatments, and comparisons across plots
  - Data limitations and caveats
    - Inconsistencies in the data description for the dataset file (7 vs 8 columns reported) versus the header definitions; treat id/Plot/Planting/Surface/position/Species/Height as the core fields
    - Possible measurement challenges for tall trees; measurement uncertainty may increase with height
    - Weed seeds from compost and undergrowth may confound species growth in some compartments
    - Some plots had signage issues and potential misalignment between treatment records and plot locations
  - How to approach analysis
    - Use height as the primary outcome; consider censoring or treating height = 0 as mortality/missing
    - Model design: fixed effects for planting and surface treatments, species, plot; random effects for compartments if appropriate
    - Integrate soil chemistry (C, N) and, if available, heavy metals data to explore correlations with growth across treatments and species
    - Validate data against QA notes and, where possible, cross-check planting/surface treatments with plot maps

- Summary of key takeaways
  - Comprehensive field experiment to assess tree growth on degraded sand tailings under varied planting and surface amendments
  - Dataset provides a structured, multi-factor design with 5 species and 4×4 treatment combinations, plus height measurements after 2.5 years
  - Rich metadata includes planting and surface treatment definitions, plot/compartment layout, and preliminary soil and biodiversity measurements
  - Data quality processes documented, with acknowledged limitations related to signage, measurement challenges, and compost-derived weed pressure
  - Suitable for analyses of treatment effects on growth, inter-species performance, and preliminary links to soil chemistry and site conditions
