# Experimental design/Sampling regime

- The EMEP4UK model is an atmospheric chemistry transport model (ACTM) coupled with the WRF weather model, producing hourly to annual average atmospheric composition and deposition; the document presents daily averaged data.
- Emissions are of two types: anthropogenic and natural.
  - Anthropogenic pollutants included: NOx, NH3, SO2, primary PM2.5, primary PMcoarse (PM10 minus PM2.5), CO, and NMVOCs, sourced at different resolutions.
  - UK emissions are from the National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI) at 1 km x 1 km, aggregated to 5 km x 5 km.
  - Rest of Europe uses EMEP CEIP emissions at 50 km x 50 km.
  - International shipping emissions (ENTEC, 2010i) are aggregated to 5 km x 5 km within the British Isles domain.
  - Forest fires are included; biogenic emissions (isoprene, monoterpenes when needed) are calculated in the model for each grid cell and at each time step using near-surface air temperature.
- Model configurations and data provenance
  - Models compiled with the FORTRAN Intel compiler (2013_sp1.3.174); calculations run on the CEH NEMSIS Linux cluster.
- Recorded value types and units
  - Surface concentrations reported for multiple species, with corresponding NetCDF variable names:
    - NO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, NH3, HNO3, SO2, NH4_F, TNO3, SO4, PART_OM_F, O3.
  - Units and NetCDF variable names provided (e.g., SURF_ug_NO for nitric oxide in µg/m3; SURF_ppb_O3 for ozone in ppbv).
- NetCDF data structure and grid details
  - Example structure (2001 SO2 output) shows:
    - Dimensions: time, i (x), j (y)
    - Time units: days since 1900-01-01
    - Spatial coordinates: i and j correspond to EMEP grid x/y in kilometers
    - Grid mapping: Polar_Stereographic projection
    - Each species variable (e.g., SURF_ug_SO2) is defined over (time, j, i) with metadata including long_name, units, and grid mapping
- Spatial and temporal resolution
  - UK domain: 5 km x 5 km resolution (emissions); daily averaged model outputs
  - European domain: 50 km x 50 km resolution for emissions
- Data quality control and caveats
  - Validation uses AURN monitoring network for hourly model output and UK Met Office AWS for WRF output
  - Simple linear regression used for comparisons; no further QA/QC performed
  - Use of dataset is at user’s risk; no warranty or guarantee of error-free data or fitness for purpose
- Temporal coverage and notable notes
  - Forest-fire data included only for 2002–2012
  - Emissions for 2013–2014 mirror 2012 values
  - 2001–2012 use WRF version 3.1.1; 2013–2014 use WRF version 3.6.1 with changes to humidity nudging in the simulation
