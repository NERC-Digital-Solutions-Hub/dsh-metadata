# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON 1972-2007' DATASET

- Long-term dataset of densities (numbers per litre) for three crustacean zooplankton taxa from Loch Leven, collected 1972–2007 by CEH Edinburgh and predecessor bodies as part of ongoing lake monitoring.
- Taxa included: Cyclops abyssorum (+ nauplii), Eudiaptomus gracilis (+ nauplii), and Daphnia sp.
- Data organized as: date, sampling information, sampling methodology, and counts of individuals per litre; sampling locations and GB grid coordinates provided (Table 1).

## Data structure and content
- Columns include: date, sampling information, sampling method, and counts (ind/L) for the three taxa.
- When multiple locations or methods are used, values are averaged.
- Zeros indicate species not recorded at the given resolution; blanks indicate missing values.
- Species names updated over time to reflect current taxonomy; identifications aimed to species level where preservation allowed.

## Sampling design and methods
- Sampling sites and locations are specified (with GB grid coordinates): Centre Loch, Kinross Bay, North Deeps, Public Pier, Castle Bay, Reed Bower, Outflow.
- Method evolution:
  - 1972–1974: fortnightly sampling using a 5 L Friedinger sampler.
  - 1975–1982: vertical plankton net haul (mesh 100 µm) or integrating tube sampler with 125 µm filter.
  - 1992 onward: 45-degree angled net haul (mesh 120 µm).
- Immediate preservation in 4% formaldehyde after collection.

## Laboratory processing and data generation
- Samples placed in 250 ml, thoroughly mixed, then sub-sampled with a 5 ml Stempel pipette.
- Species identified under low-power microscope; typically three subsamples counted.
- Counts converted to ind/L using multiplication factors; samples reconstituted and archived post-analysis.

## Quality control and provenance
- Data quality controlled by:
  - Dr Linda May for pre-1992 data.
  - Iain Gunn for 1992–2007 data.
- References used for taxonomic identification and methodology (e.g., works by Dussart & Defaye, Einsle, Flößner & Kraus, George & Owen, Harding & Smith, Scourfield & Harding, Johnson).

## Usage notes and caveats
- Zeros indicate non-recording at the sampling/analytic resolution, not necessarily complete absence from Loch Leven.
- Blanks indicate missing values.
- Averages across sites/methods should be interpreted with caution due to changes in sampling methods over time.
- Taxonomic names updated to reflect current nomenclature; older records adjusted accordingly.

## Spatial metadata
- Sampling sites with precise GB national grid coordinates (Easting/Northing) listed in Table 1, enabling geographic context and potential spatial analyses.
