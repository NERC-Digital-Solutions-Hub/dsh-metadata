# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON 1972-2007' DATASET

## Overview
- Long-term dataset of crustacean zooplankton densities from Loch Leven, 1972–2007.
- Collected by CEH Edinburgh and predecessor organisations as part of a lake monitoring programme.
- Three major taxa reported: Cyclops abyssorum (+ nauplii), Eudiaptomus gracilis (+ nauplii), and Daphnia sp.
- Data expressed as numbers of individuals per litre (ind/l) per sample.

## Data Structure and Content
- Columns include: date of sample, relevant sampling information, sampling methodology, and abundances (ind/l) for the three taxa.
- Sampling locations are indicated; GB national grid locations provided in Table 1.
- When multiple locations or methods are used, values are averaged.
- Zeros indicate the species was not recorded at the sampling/analytic resolution; blanks indicate missing values.
- The dataset has undergone quality control by two long-term researchers (Dr Linda May and Iain Gunn).

## Spatial Information
- Table 1 lists sampling sites with GB National Grid coordinates (Easting and Northing):
  - Centre Loch
  - Kinross Bay
  - North Deeps
  - Public Pier
  - Castle Bay
  - Reed Bower
  - Outflow
- Exact coordinates are provided for each site.

## Sampling Methods and Temporal Changes
- 1972–1974: fortnightly sampling using a 5 L Friedinger sampler.
- 1975–1982: sampling by vertical plankton net haul (mesh 100 µm) or integrating tube sampler with 125 µm filter.
- From 1992: sampling with a 45-degree angled net haul (mesh 120 µm).
- Immediately after collection, samples preserved in 4% formaldehyde.

## Laboratory Procedures
- Samples placed in 250 ml final volume; thoroughly mixed; sub-sampled with a 5 ml pipette.
- Species identified under a low-power microscope; counts performed.
- Typically three subsamples counted.
- Species identified to the most specific taxonomic level possible given preservation and maturity.
- Sub-sample counts converted to ind/l using appropriate multiplication factors.
- After counting, samples reconstituted and archived.
- Taxonomic names updated if later nomenclature changes occurred.

## Data Quality, Processing, and Provenance
- Quality control performed by Dr Linda May (pre-1992 data) and Iain Gunn (1992–2007 data).
- Data produced as part of Loch Leven long-term monitoring programme.
- Names and taxonomic references updated to reflect current classifications.

## References and Taxonomic Keys
- Key references for identification used in the lab work, including:
  - Dussart & Defaye (1995)
  - Einsle (1996)
  - Flößner & Kraus (1986)
  - George & Owen (1978)
  - Harding & Smith (1974)
  - Johnson (1977)
  - Scourfield & Harding (1966)

## Usage Considerations for Analysis
- Long-term trends and correlations can be explored, with attention to:
  - Changes in sampling methods over time that may affect comparability.
  - Handling of zeros versus missing values.
  - Averaging across multiple locations/methods when present.
- Data are tied to specific sampling sites with geographic coordinates, enabling spatial analyses but requiring careful alignment of methods and scales across years.
- Dataset supports reproducible analysis with explicit metadata on collection, processing, and quality control.
