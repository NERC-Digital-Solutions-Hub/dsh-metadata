# LOCH LEVEN CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON 1972-2007

- Overview
  - Long-term dataset of crustacean zooplankton densities from Loch Leven, collected 1972–2007 by CEH Edinburgh and predecessors as part of ongoing lake monitoring.
  - Provides time-series data useful for assessing environmental health and policy performance over time.

- Data structure and content
  - Columns include: date of sample, relevant sampling information, sampling methodology, and counts of three major crustacean zooplankton taxa per litre (Cyclops abyssorum (+ nauplii), Eudiaptomus gracilis (+ nauplii), Daphnia sp.).
  - Sampling locations are indicated; GB national grid locations are provided (Table 1).
  - When multiple locations/methods are listed, values are averaged.
  - Zeros indicate non-record within the sampling/analytical resolution; blanks indicate missing values.
  - Taxonomic names updated where changes occurred over time.

- Sampling sites and coordinates
  - Key sampling sites with GB National Grid references:
    - Centre Loch: Easting 314654, Northing 701481

    - Reed Bower: Easting 313568, Northing 701141
    - Outflow: Easting 317004, Northing 699380

- Sampling methods over time
  - 1972–1974: fortnightly sampling using a 5 L Friedinger sampler.
  - 1975–1982: either vertical plankton net hauls (mesh 100 µm) or integrating tube sampler with 125 µm filter; depth-specific sampling.
  - 1992 onward: 45-degree angled net hauls (mesh 120 µm).

- Laboratory processing and counts
  - Samples preserved in 4% formaldehyde immediately after collection.
  - In the lab: samples placed in 250 ml volume, thoroughly mixed, and sub-sampled with a 5 ml Stempel pipette.
  - Identification and counting under a low-power binocular microscope; typically three sub-samples counted.
  - Species identified to the species level where preservation allows.
  - Sub-sample counts converted to individuals per litre (ind/L) using appropriate factors.
  - Preserved samples reconstituted and archived.
  - Species names updated if taxonomic changes occurred since collection.

- Quality control and validation
  - Data quality controlled by Dr. Linda May (pre-1992) and Iain Gunn (1992–2007); Dr. May checked pre-1992 data, Iain Gunn analyzed/checked 1992–2007 data.
  - References provided for taxonomic keys and methods used in identification.

- Data usage and accessibility
  - Dataset designed for standardised reporting of environmental health indicators (zooplankton densities) suitable for time-series analyses.
  - Data handling includes archiving and potential integration into broader datasets; notes on combining with other data to enhance value and accessibility of underlying data.
