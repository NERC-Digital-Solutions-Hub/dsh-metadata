# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON 1972-2007' DATASET

## Purpose and scope
- Metadata for a long-term dataset of crustacean zooplankton densities from Loch Leven, collected 1972–2007 as part of the lake’s monitoring programme.
- Recorded variables include date, sampling information, sampling methodology, and densities (ind/L) of three major crustacean zooplankton taxa: Cyclops abyssorum (+ nauplii), Eudiaptomus gracilis (+ nauplii), and Daphnia sp.
- Sampling locations and GB grid coordinates are provided; when multiple locations/methods are used, values are averaged.
- Zeros indicate the species was not recorded at the sampling/analytical resolution; blanks indicate missing values.

## Dataset structure
- Columns: date, sampling information, sampling methodology, and densities for the three taxa.
- Locations are specified with corresponding GB national grid references; older data names have been updated where taxonomy changed.

## Data quality assurance (QA) and metadata completeness
- QA performed by Dr Linda May (pre-1992 data) and Iain Gunn (1992–2007 data).
- Data checked and corrected across the full time series; species names updated to current taxonomy where needed.

## Sampling locations (GB grid coordinates)
- Centre Loch: Easting 314654, Northing 701481
- Kinross Bay: E 312744, N 701317
- North Deeps: E 314058, N 703093
- Public Pier: E 312981, N 701715
- Castle Bay: E 313550, N 702383
- Reed Bower: E 313568, N 701141
- Outflow: E 317004, N 699380

## Sampling methods and timeline
- 1972–1974: fortnightly sampling with a 5 L Friedinger sampler.
- 1975–1982: vertical plankton net haul (mesh 100 µm) or integrating tube sampler with a 125 µm filter; depth-specific sampling as indicated.
- 1992 onward: 45-degree angled net haul (mesh 120 µm).
- Preservation: samples preserved in 4% formaldehyde.
- Laboratory processing: samples reconstituted to 250 ml, mixed, then subsampled (5 ml); organisms identified (as per references) and counted under a low-power microscope; typically three subsamples counted; counts converted to ind/L; samples re-archived.

## Data processing and taxonomy
- Species identified to the extent allowed by preservation and maturity stage.
- Identifications updated in dataset where species names have changed over time.
- Counts converted to densities and data compiled for long-term analysis.

## Data accessibility and governance
- Underlying data are maintained with quality controls and archived.
- Metadata highlights data provenance, collection methods, and quality checks.
- Data management practices emphasize openness of data where possible, with the understanding that some constraints (e.g., sharing full datasets publicly) may apply.

## Limitations and considerations for use
- Comparability across periods may be affected by changes in sampling methods and mesh sizes.
- Zero values do not guarantee absence; reflect detection at the sampling/analytical resolution.
- Missing values are indicated by blanks, which may affect time-series analyses.
