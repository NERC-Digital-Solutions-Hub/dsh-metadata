# Methods taken from Liver concentrations of flame retardants in Eurasian otters ( Lutra lutra ) collected from Scotland between 2013 and 2015: a Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) Report

## Overview
- Study analyzing liver concentrations of PBDE flame retardants in Eurasian otters from Scotland (2013–2015), as part of the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS).
- 16 otters with livers collected for PBDE analysis.
- Aimed to quantify 32 PBDE congeners across multiple BDE ranges (tri- to nona-BDEs).

## Data collection (collection of carcasses)
- Otters found dead and subjected to post-mortem examination under the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP) to determine sex and age.
- Age classes estimated from morphometric data and indicators of reproductive activity.
- Age estimation method references include weight and signs of sexual maturity; juvenile/sub-adult/adult classifications defined by weight thresholds and reproductive indicators.
- Tissue samples, including liver, were collected during post-mortem examination.

## Analytical methods
- Liver samples analyzed at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster.
- Analyzed 32 PBDEs: tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, and nona-BDEs.
- Sub-sample preparation: ~1 g of liver thawed, weighed, ground with sand, dried; spiked with 13C PBDE and 13C BFR internal standards; Soxhlet extraction in dichloromethane (DCM) for 16 hours.
- Lipids measured gravimetrically; extract cleaned using automated size-exclusion chromatography followed by a deactivated alumina column.
- GC-MS analysis with a programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet; detailed instrument conditions provided (column type, carrier gas, injection parameters, and temperature program).
- Quantification using internal standards and calibration curves based on PBDE standards; recoveries for 13C-PBDE standards (BDE 28, 47, 126, 153, 197) ranged 94–98%.

## Data expression, format and analysis
- Reported concentrations in ng/g wet weight (wet wt).
- When calculating summed PBDE concentrations, non-detects were assigned a value of zero.
