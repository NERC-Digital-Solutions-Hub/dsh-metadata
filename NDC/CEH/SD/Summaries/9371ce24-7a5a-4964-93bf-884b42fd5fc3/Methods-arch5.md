# Methods taken from Liver concentrations of flame retardants in Eurasian otters ( Lutra lutra ) collected from Scotland between 2013 and 2015: a Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) Report

## Overview and scope
- Study of liver concentrations of flame retardants (PBDEs) in Eurasian otters collected in Scotland from 2013 to 2015.
- Part of the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP) with otters found dead and subjected to post-mortem examination.
- 16 otters analyzed for residues of PBDEs, specifically 32 congeners (tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, and nona-BDEs).
- Data are prepared for an associated data download file listing the compounds reported.

## Sample collection and metadata
- Post-mortem determination of sex and age; age-class defined as adult, sub-adult, or juvenile using morphometrics and reproductive indicators (Chadwick, 2007).
- Additional recorded data: nutritional status, reproductive status, lesions, growths, and concretions.
- Age classification criteria based on weight and signs of maturity:
  - Juvenile: females < 2.1 kg or males < 3 kg.
  - Sub-adult: heavier individuals without reproductive signs or with specific anatomical indicators.
  - Adult: heavier individuals with evidence of reproduction and corresponding anatomical criteria.
- Liver tissue collected for PBDE analysis.

## Analytical methods
- Liver analyses performed at Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster.
- 32 BDE congeners quantified; sample preparation and instrumentation described in detail:
  - Sub-sample (~1 g) thawed, weighed, ground, and dried.
  - Spiked with 13C-labeled PBDEs and PBDE recovery standards.
  - Soxhlet extraction in dichloromethane (DCM) for 16 hours.
  - Lipid content determined gravimetrically.
  - Extract cleaned via automated size-exclusion chromatography followed by deactivated alumina column.
  - BDEs analyzed by GC-MS with a programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet.
  - Internal standards used; 100 μL injected into GC-MS with specific injector conditions and a 25 m HT8 column (helium carrier gas).
  - Temperature program: isothermal 80°C, ramp to 200°C, then to 315°C with final hold.
- Quantification:
  - Recovery-corrected concentrations using internal standards.
  - Calibration curves based on PBDE standards.
  - Average recoveries (13C-PBDE standards) for BDE 28, 47, 126, 153, 197 between 94% and 98%.

## Data expression, format, and analysis
- Liver concentrations reported as ng/g wet weight (wet wt).
- When calculating summed PBDE concentrations, values below detection limits (non-detects) treated as zero.

## Metadata, provenance, and references
- Age estimation methodology referenced to Chadwick (2007) for post-mortem otter study (England and Wales, 1992–2003).
