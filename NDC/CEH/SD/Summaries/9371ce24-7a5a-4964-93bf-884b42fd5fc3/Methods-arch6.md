# Methods taken from Liver concentrations of flame retardants in Eurasian otters ( Lutra lutra ) collected from Scotland between 2013 and 2015: a Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) Report by L.A Walker, C. Moeckel, M.G. Pereira, E.D. Potter, E.A. Chadwick & R.F. Shore

## Purpose and scope
- Assess concentrations of PBDEs (32 congeners) in livers of Eurasian otters collected in Scotland during 2013–2015.
- Undertaken as part of the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP) and analyzed at central analytical laboratories for PBDEs.

## Sample collection and metadata
- Otters found dead and subjected to post-mortem examination to determine sex and age class (adult, sub-adult, juvenile) using morphometric data and reproductive indicators.
- Age classification criteria include weight thresholds and reproductive signs (e.g., nipple development, uterus signs for females; baculum length for males).
- Tissue sampling: liver collected from each otter; total of 16 livers analyzed from Scotland (2013–2015).
- Additional notes recorded: nutritional and reproductive status, lesions, growths, and concretions.

## Analytical methods and quality assurance
- Laboratory: Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster (centralized analytical facilities).
- Analytes: concentrations of 32 PBDEs (6 tri-, 6 tetra-, 6 penta-, 4 hexa-, 2 hepta-, 5 octa-, and 3 nona-BDEs).
- Sample preparation: sub-sample (~1 g) thawed, weighed, ground with sand, dried with sodium sulfate; spiked with 13C-labeled PBDE recovery standards and 13C BFRs; Soxhlet extraction in dichloromethane for 16 h.
- Lipids: lipid content determined gravimetrically after extraction.
- Cleanup: automated size-exclusion chromatography followed by a deactivated alumina column.
- Analysis: all BDEs quantified by GC-MS with internal standards; 100 μL injected into GC-MS with programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet.
- Instrument conditions: detailed GC-MS temperature program and column (25 m HT8, 0.22 mm ID, 0.25 μm film); helium carrier gas (2.0 mL/min).
- Quantification: recovery-corrected concentrations using internal standards and calibration curves based on PBDE standards.
- Quality control: recovery for 13C-PBDE standards (BDE-28, -47, -126, -153, -197) ranged 94–98%.

## Data expression, formatting, and analysis
- Reported as concentrations in ng/g wet weight (ng/g ww).
- For summed PBDE concentrations, values below detection limits (non-detects) assigned a zero value.
