# Methods taken from Liver concentrations of flame retardants in Eurasian otters ( Lutra lutra ) collected from Scotland between 2013 and 2015: a Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) Report

## 1.1. Collection of carcasses
- Part of the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP); otters found dead are examined to determine sex and age.
- Age-class is estimated from morphometric data and indicators of reproductive activity; classifications follow Chadwick (2007).
- Record nutritional/reproductive status, lesions, growths, and concretions during post-mortem.
- Liver tissue collected for analysis of PBDEs (32 congeners: tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, and nona-BDEs).
- Age estimation uses weight and signs of sexual maturity; specific thresholds define juvenile, sub-adult, and adult for both sexes.

## 1.2. Analytical methods
- Liver samples analysed at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster.
- Quantification of 32 BDEs with GC-MS; includes 6 tri-, 6 tetra-, 6 penta-, 4 hexa-, 2 hepta-, 5 octa-, and 3 nona-BDEs.
- Sample preparation: ~1 g subsample ground with sand, dried with sodium sulphate, spiked with 13C-labeled recovery standards, Soxhlet extracted in dichloromethane for 16 h.
- Lipid content determined gravimetrically; extract cleaned using automated size-exclusion chromatography followed by a deactivated alumina column.
- GC-MS analysis: internal standards added; 100 µL injected into GC-MS with programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet; specific injector conditions and temperature program detailed.
- Instrument column: 25 m HT8; carrier gas: helium (2.0 mL/min).
- Quantification: recovery-corrected concentrations using internal standards and calibration curves; average recoveries for 13C-PBDE standards (BDE 28, 47, 126, 153, 197) ranged 94–98%.

## 1.3. Data expression, format and analysis
- Liver concentrations reported as ng/g wet weight.
- When calculating summed PBDE concentrations, non-detected congeners are assigned a zero value.
- Data and compounds reported are linked to a data download file listing the analyzed congeners.
