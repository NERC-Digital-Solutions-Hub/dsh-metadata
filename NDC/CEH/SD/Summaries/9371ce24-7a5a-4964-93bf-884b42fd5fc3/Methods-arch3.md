# Methods taken from Liver concentrations of flame retardants in Eurasian otters ( Lutra lutra ) collected from Scotland between 2013 and 2015: a Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) Report

## Aim and scope
- Assess liver concentrations of flame retardants (PBDEs) in Eurasian otters collected in Scotland during 2013–2015.
- Part of the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP) and aligned with the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS).

## Collection of carcasses
- Otters found dead were subjected to post-mortem examination to determine sex and age.
- Age-class defined as juvenile, sub-adult, or adult using morphometrics and reproductive indicators.
- Additional notes recorded: nutritional and reproductive status, lesions, and growths.
- Liver tissue collected for chemical analysis from 16 otters.

## Analytical methods
- Target compounds: 32 PBDE congeners across tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, and nona-BDEs; list specified in the data download file.
- Sample preparation (per liver sample ~1 g):
  - Thawed, weighed, ground with sand, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate.
  - Spiked with 13C-labeled PBDEs and 13C-labeled BFRs as recovery standards.
  - Soxhlet extraction in dichloromethane for 16 hours.
  - Lipid content determined gravimetrically.
  - Extract cleaned via automated size-exclusion chromatography followed by a deactivated alumina column.
- Instrumental analysis:
  - Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with a programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet.
  - Internal standards used; 100 μL injected per run.
  - Column: 25 m HT8; helium carrier gas at 2.0 mL/min.
  - Temperature program: initial hold, ramp to 200°C, ramp to 315°C, hold, then cool.
- Quantification:
  - Recovery-corrected concentrations using internal standards.
  - Calibration curves based on PBDE standards.
  - Average recoveries for 13C-PBDE standards ranged between 94% and 98% for key congeners (BDE 28, 47, 126, 153, 197).

## Data expression, format and analysis
- Concentrations reported as ng/g wet weight (wet wt).
- When summing total PBDEs, non-detects were treated as zero.

## Data governance and provenance
- Analysis performed at centralized laboratories (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster).
- Methodology documented in detail to ensure reproducibility and quality assurance.
- Data and congeners specified for public reporting/download.

## Relevance for monitoring and decision-making
- Demonstrates an end-to-end monitoring workflow: from field carcass collection and metadata to laboratory analysis, QA, data reporting, and data sharing.
- Provides a replicable framework for evaluating environmental flame retardant exposure in wildlife, informing policy decisions and future monitoring planning.
