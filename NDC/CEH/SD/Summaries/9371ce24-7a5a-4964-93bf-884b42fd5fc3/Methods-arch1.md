# Methods taken from Liver concentrations of flame retardants in Eurasian otters ( Lutra lutra ) collected from Scotland between 2013 and 2015: a Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) Report

## Study design and sample collection
- Otters found dead were examined to determine sex and age; age-class estimated from morphometric data and indicators of reproductive activity.
- Additional notes collected: nutritional and reproductive status, lesions, growths, and concretions.
- Tissue samples, including the liver, were taken during post-mortem examinations.
- Between 2013 and 2015, liver samples were collected from 16 otters in Scotland for analysis of PBDEs.
- Age classification:
  - Juvenile: females < 2.1 kg or males < 3 kg
  - Sub-adult: females > 2.1 kg or males > 3 kg with no signs of reproduction; or baculum < 60 mm
  - Adult: females > 2.1 kg with reproductive signs or males > 3 kg with baculum ≥ 60 mm
- Context: part of the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP).

## Analytical methods
- Liver analyses conducted at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster.
- Analyzed 32 BDEs (6 tri-BDEs, 6 tetra-BDEs, 6 penta-BDEs, 4 hexa-BDEs, 2 hepta-BDEs, 5 octa-BDEs, 3 nona-BDEs).
- Sample preparation:
  - Sub-sample (~1 g) thawed, accurately weighed, ground with sand, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate.
  - Spiked with 13C-labeled PBDE and 13C-labeled BFR recovery standards.
  - Soxhlet extraction in dichloromethane (DCM) for 16 h.
  - Lipid content determined gravimetrically.
  - Extracts cleaned using automated size exclusion chromatography followed by a deactivated alumina column.
- Instrumental analysis:
  - All BDEs quantified by GC-MS.
  - Extracts spiked with internal standards; 100 µL injected into GC-MS with a programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet.
  - PTV conditions: 55°C for 0.45 min, ramp to 325°C at 700°C/min, hold 325°C for 5 min; cool to 315°C at 10°C/min.
  - Column: 25 m HT8 (0.22 mm ID, 0.25 µm film).
  - Carrier gas: helium (2.0 mL/min).
  - Temperature program: 80°C for 2.4 min; ramp to 200°C at 25°C/min; ramp to 315°C at 5°C/min; hold at 315°C for 9.8 min.
- Quantification and quality control:
  - Concentrations corrected for recoveries using internal standards.
  - Calibration curves based on PBDE standards.
  - Average recoveries for 13C-PBDE standards (BDE 28, 47, 126, 153, 197) ranged from 94% to 98%.

## Data expression, format and analysis
- Reported as ng/g wet weight (wet wt) for liver concentrations of flame retardants.
- When summing total PBDE concentrations, non-detects (below detection limits) were assigned a zero value.
