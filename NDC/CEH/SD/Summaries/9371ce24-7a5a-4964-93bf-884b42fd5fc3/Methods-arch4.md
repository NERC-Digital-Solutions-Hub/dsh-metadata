# Methods taken from Liver concentrations of flame retardants in Eurasian otters ( Lutra lutra ) collected from Scotland between 2013 and 2015: a Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) Report

## 1.1. Collection of carcasses
- Part of the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP); otters found dead were examined to determine sex and age.
- Age-class estimation from morphometric data and indicators of reproductive activity (Chadwick, 2007); additional notes on nutritional and reproductive status, lesions, growths, and concretions.
- Tissue samples, including liver, collected during post-mortem; 16 otters from Scotland (2013–2015) used for PBDE analysis (tri-BDE through nona-BDEs).
- Age determination methods: weight and signs of sexual maturity; juvenile, sub-adult, and adult classifications defined by weight thresholds and reproductive indicators (e.g., baculum length).

## 1.2. Analytical methods
- Liver analyses conducted at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster (centralized laboratory).
- Quantification of 32 BDEs (6 tri-, 6 tetra-, 6 penta-, 4 hexa-, 2 hepta-, 5 octa-, 3 nona-BDEs; list provided in the data file).
- Sample preparation: ~1 g liver subsample thawed, weighed, ground with sand, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4; spiked with 13C PBDEs and 13C BFRs; Soxhlet extraction in DCM for 16 h.
- Lipid content measured gravimetrically; extract cleaned using automated size-exclusion chromatography followed by a deactivated alumina column.
- Analysis: all BDEs measured by GC-MS; extracts spiked with internal standards; 100 μL injected into GC-MS with programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet.
- Instrument specifics: PTV inlet conditions (55°C initially, then ramp to 325°C, hold); GC-MS setup with 25 m HT8 column; helium as carrier gas (2.0 mL/min); temperature program detailed (isothermal 80°C, ramp to 315°C with holds).
- Quantification: recovery-corrected concentrations using internal standards and calibration curves from PBDE standards.
- Quality control: average recoveries for 13C-PBDE standards for key congeners (BDE 28, 47, 126, 153, 197) ranged 94–98%.

## 1.3. Data expression, format and analysis
- Reported liver concentrations as ng/g wet weight (wet wt).
- When calculating summed PBDE concentrations, data handling for non-detects: values below detection limits were assigned a zero value.
