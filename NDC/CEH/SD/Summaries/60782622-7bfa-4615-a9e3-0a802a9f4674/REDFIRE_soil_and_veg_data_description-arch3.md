# Soil and vegetation radionuclide activity concentrations and calculated dose rates from the Red Forest, Chernobyl, Ukraine (2016-2017)

## Objective and context
- Investigates how radiation impacts forest recovery after the 1986 Chernobyl accident, in a fire-affected area known as the Red Forest.
- Combines measurements of radionuclide activity concentrations with calculations of dose rates to grassy vegetation, deciduous trees, and bacteria.
- Uses a before-after-like assessment across burnt and unburnt plots to understand secondary stressor effects (fire) on an already contaminated ecosystem.

## Study design and sampling
- sixty study plots established in September 2017 within the Red Forest, covering burnt and unburnt areas; nine additional plots near Buriakivka village (≈8 km from the Red Forest).
- At each plot, a 1x1 m2 area used for soil-related studies; an adjacent 1x1 m2 area harvested for vegetation analysis.
- Plot locations recorded with GPS (≈3 m accuracy); many plots previously used by the TREE project.
- Burn status quantified with a burn score (1 = no burn, 2 = some burn, 3 = all plot burnt).
- Pine forest past history inferred from site observations and local knowledge.

## Field and laboratory methods
- Vegetation: samples harvested in September 2017, separated into grassy and other vegetation; fresh mass recorded, samples air-dried, then dry mass recorded.
- Soil: five cores per plot (2.5 cm diameter, 10 cm deep) collected, bulked, and homogenised; subsamples for pH, moisture, and radionuclide analyses.
- Sample preparation: grasses homogenised for radionuclide analyses; soils dried prior to radionuclide analyses.
- Radionuclide analyses:
  - Cs-137 measured with high-purity germanium gamma detector; calibration with Cs-137/Eu-152 sources.
  - Sr-90 measured with a beta-spectrometer; no radiochemical pre-treatment; daily calibrations.
  - Am-241 and Pu isotopes analyzed after chemical separation using yield tracers, HF dissolution, and multi-step separation; alpha spectrometry used for activity determination.
- Transfer parameters used for concentration calculations:
  - Am-241, Pu isotopes for grassy vegetation and pine wood transfer using published data from Red Forest/CEZ sites.
  - Sr-90 and Cs-137 transfer to deciduous trees using parameters from Ukrainian and CEZ studies.
- Dose estimation tools:
  - ERICA Tool version 1.3 used to estimate weighted absorbed dose rates to grassy vegetation and trees (external dose from measured soil activity).
  - Revised R&D128 model used to estimate bacterial dose rates.
  - Ambient soil surface dose rates measured in Sept 2016 and Mar 2017 at each plot (µSv h⁻¹).

## Radionuclides and dose calculations
- Target radionuclides: Sr-90, Cs-137, Am-241, Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-240 (in soil, grassy vegetation, deciduous tree wood, and bacteria where applicable).
- For grassy vegetation and soils, examined internal and external weighted absorbed dose rates by isotope, plus total dose rates.
- For deciduous trees, computed internal, external, and total weighted absorbed dose rates by isotope and overall.
- Bacteria dose rates calculated using the R&D128 model.
- Ambient dose rate data complemented by plot-specific soil activity concentrations to derive comprehensive dose assessments.

## Data collected and dataset structure
- Plot metadata: plot number, location, pine forest past history, burn score.
- Environmental measurements: ambient dose rate (Sept 2016, Mar 2017) at each plot; soil pH, moisture (March/Sep 2017); loss on ignition (LOI) of soil.
- Vegetation data: fresh mass and dry mass for grassy and other vegetation; activity concentrations (dry mass and fresh mass) for Sr-90 and Cs-137 with uncertainties.
- Transfer parameter-based estimates: soil-to-plant transfer-adjusted activity concentrations for grassy vegetation and deciduous tree wood (Sr-90, Cs-137, Am-241, Pu isotopes).
- Soil radionuclide concentrations: measured activity concentrations for Sr-90, Cs-137, Am-241, Pu isotopes (in dry mass).
- Dose data: internal and external weighted absorbed dose rates by isotope for grassy vegetation and deciduous tree wood; total weighted absorbed dose rates by isotope and overall for grassy vegetation, deciduous tree wood, and bacteria.
- Proportions and contextual measurements: percent dry mass of soil samples, exact sampling times, and methodological details for reproducibility.

## Uncertainties and detection limits
- Cs-137 activity concentrations: minimally detectable activity ~0.18 Bq per sample; uncertainties ~10–15% (p=0.95) depending on sample type.
- Sr-90 activity concentrations: uncertainties ~20% (p=0.95) in soil and grassy vegetation analyses.
- Radiochemical procedures and calibrations documented to support error characterization and reproducibility.

## Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a comprehensive field-to-dose assessment framework combining:
  - A structured sampling design across varying disturbance (burnt vs unburnt) conditions.
  - Standardized laboratory analyses for key radionuclides.
  - Use of established dose-model tools (ERICA, R&D128) to convert activity concentrations into ecological dose rates.
  - Integration of transfer parameters from prior, site-specific studies to estimate biota-specific radionuclide uptake.
  - Inclusion of ambient dose rates to contextualize site-specific measurements.
- Highlights data management practices relevant to monitoring frameworks:
  - Compilation of a detailed dataset with multi-domain measurements (plot metadata, environmental conditions, radionuclide concentrations, dose calculations).
  - Documentation of methods, calibration, and uncertainties to enable transparency and reproducibility.
- Addresses monitoring challenges relevant to policy and governance:
  - Use of both external and internal dose components across multiple ecological compartments (grass, trees, bacteria).
  - Application of data from prior studies to fill knowledge gaps (transfer parameters) while maintaining site-specific measurements.
  - Emphasizes the need for robust, standardized methodologies and clear metadata to support data sharing, interpretation, and decision-making.
