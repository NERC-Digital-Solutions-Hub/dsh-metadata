# WeatherData.csv

## Overview
- Dataset capturing temperate rainfall and air temperature recorded during measurement campaigns of Welsh Mountain ewes equipped with Daily Diary sensors (Wildbyte Technologies Ltd., UK).
- Two pasture sites: Semi-Improved and Unimproved.
- Temporal resolution: rainfall and temperature recorded at half-hourly intervals.
- Unimproved site uses nearby COSMOS facility data for temperature and rainfall (Evans et al., 2016).
- For campaign details, see UrineEventsReadMe.csv.
- Authors and project details: Project Uplands-N2O, Grant NE/M015351/1; authors listed.

## Data collection and sources
- On-site measurements: Rainfall and Temp at the semi-improved site.
- External data: Temperature and Rainfall for the unimproved site sourced from COSMOS facility (53°23′N, 4°0ʹW).
- COSMOS reference: Evans, J.G. et al., 2016 (COSMOS-UK).
- Data provenance notes: Fully cited when data are reused; dataset includes authors and grant information.
