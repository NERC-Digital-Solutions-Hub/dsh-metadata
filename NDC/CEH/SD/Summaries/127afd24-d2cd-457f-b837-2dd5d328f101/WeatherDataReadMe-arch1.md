# WeatherData.csv

## Overview
- Describes temperate rainfall and associated temperature data recorded during measurement campaigns involving Welsh Mountain ewes equipped with Daily Diary (DD) sensors.
- See UrineEventsReadMe.csv for additional campaign details.
- For data reuse, ensure full citation of the dataset.

## Data Source and Sites
- Semi-Improved pasture: rainfall and air temperature recorded at half-hourly intervals at Skye Instruments Ltd., Llandrindod Wells, UK.
- Unimproved pasture: air temperature and rainfall data sourced from a nearby COSMOS facility (approx. 53°23′N, 4°0′W).
- COSMOS reference: Evans et al., 2016 (COSMOS-UK soil moisture observing system).

## Data Structure and Variables
- Headers: Site, Season, DateTime, Rainfall, Temp.
- DateTime format: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss.
- Rainfall: measured in millimetres (mm).
- Temp: air temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
- Season values: spring or autumn at each site.

## Usage Notes
- Data products are linked to measurement campaigns and may require consulting UrineEventsReadMe.csv for campaign-specific context.
- Data provenance from two distinct site setups enables comparative analyses (semi-improved vs unimproved pastures).
