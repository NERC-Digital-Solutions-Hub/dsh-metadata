# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## CS Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Preserve scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future rights to survey land.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH under FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Location data can identify squares within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when approximate location is sufficient.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing by CEH; very exceptional cases may permit external release under licence if applicant proves IP confidentiality at least equal to CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares could reveal square location and is subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit data.

## Licence terms and usage restrictions
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals for the agreed purpose.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
- End of licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- Do not release data or derived information to third parties if it could compromise square confidentiality; consult CEH if unsure.
- Location data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements; cannot be used to deduce precise locations or claim such deduction.

## Roles and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by an authorised senior official of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS partnership use, CEH aims to enable pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partner organisations and other potential users are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH may assist as part of collaboration or for a fee, negotiated case-by-case.
