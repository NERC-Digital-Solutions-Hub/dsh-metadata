# Headwaters

- Purpose and aim
  - Provide data in a consistent, comparable format to demonstrate environmental condition and support scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Employ standardised, broadly applicable monitoring approaches suitable for organisations with established monitoring responsibilities.

- Scope and overview
  - Re-survey of all 425 CS2000 squares for headwaters in CS2007, focusing on macroscale hydromorphology, biology, and chemistry.
  - Within each of the 425 squares, macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology, and physical characteristics are collected; and in randomly selected ponds within 629 CS2007 squares containing ponds, aquatic plant community, physical characteristics, and water chemistry are surveyed.
  - Countryside Survey (CS) is positioned as the national freshwater survey capable of addressing multiple water body types across GB.

- Data collection components and methods
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS-compatible)
    - Target a single continuous stream area (5–15 m, depending on width) with three minutes of active kick-net sampling plus one minute of manual searching.
    - Use a standard 25 cm2 pond-net with 900 µm mesh; sample proportional to habitat cover; avoid over-collection in one site; preserve and label samples for lab identification.
    - Exclude certain organisms from live collection (fish, amphibians, many rare species) and return them to water when possible; record presence on forms.
    - Fixed sampling time; rigorous net cleaning between sites to prevent cross-contamination.
  - Water chemistry (headwaters)
    - Single indicative chemical sample per headwater site for SRP, TON, and alkalinity; field measurements of pH and conductivity.
    - On-site filtration of SRP/TON/alkalinity samples through 0.45 µm filters; meticulous labeling and sample handling; lab analyses coordinated with CEH laboratories.
  - Hydromorphology and habitat data (RHS)
    - 500 m RHS survey centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site; includes hydromorphological indices and habitat type (pool/run/refle/Slack), bed stability, substrate, channel shading, and water clarity.
    - Data entered in the field via the RAPID system (MS Access) on a Tablet PC; RHS training and accreditation provided; on-site data validation with RAPID.
  - Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR)
    - 100 m reach (50 m upstream and 50 m downstream of macroinvertebrate center) surveyed for macrophyte and bryophyte presence, cover (on a 9-point scale), and physical characteristics.
    - Wading preferred; grapnel used for submerged plants when depth or safety restricts wading.
    - Plant specimens identified to species where possible; procedures for collecting and preserving difficult taxa; specimen submission guidance to experts when needed.
  - Photographic relocation aids
    - Photographs of macroinvertebrate sampling area, RHS features, and macrophyte surveys; marker boards with letters (M, RHS, MTR) and square numbers included to aid relocation.
  - Field data management and validation
    - Use of RAPID for RHS data entry and IRIS for aquatic plant data entry; both systems provide in-field validation and data integrity checks.
    - On-site data checks completed before leaving the site; field survey checklist to ensure no tasks are missed.

- Pond condition assessments (CS2007)
  - Pond mapping and boundary identification; survey pond selection where multiple ponds exist within a square.
  - Measurements and observations include pond area estimation, drawdown height, proportion of water present, sediment and pond base composition, inflows/outflows, turbidity, and water chemistry.
  - Macrophyte survey within the pond boundary (submerged, floating-leaved, emergent; plant identification and abundance estimates; specimen handling and legal considerations for rare species).
  - Environmental and land-use context around ponds, including surrounding land-use within 0–5 m and 0–100 m zones; amenity value and public access considerations.
  - Documentation of pond management, grazing, waterbird and fish use, and potential pollution sources; final data sheets compiled and sent to Pond Conservation.
  - Safety and logistics emphasize two-person field teams, pond-specific hazards, and thorough field notes and site sketches.

- Data handling, portals, and quality control
  - Standardised digital data capture to enable cross-site comparability and longitudinal health assessments.
  - On-site validation for macroinvertebrate (RIVPACS) and plant (MTR/IRIS) data to improve data quality before submission.
  - Regular training, accreditation, and team rotation to maintain consistency across survey teams; ~7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff.
  - Final data and specimens transported to CEH Dorset or Pond Conservation with documented chain-of-custody, using transport emergency cards (TREM) for formaldehyde-containing samples.
  - Documentation and reporting robustly designed to enable dataset integration, re-use, and policy evaluation over time.

- Practical considerations for analysts
  - Emphasis on standardization to support temporal and spatial comparisons across GB.
  - Integrated data streams (RIVPACS macroinvertebrates, RHS hydromorphology, MTR macrophytes, pond condition metrics) suitable for holistic environmental health indicators.
  - Clear guidelines for data availability and underlying data access to enhance reuse beyond single outputs.
  - Handling of challenging taxa (rare species, Ranunculus, Charophytes) with recommended specimen collection and expert confirmation pathways.

- Endnotes and references
  - Aligns with established UK methodologies (RHS, RIVPACS, MTR) and Environment Agency manuals (CS2003 RHS guidance; 2007 field manuals).
  - Data workflows leverage field-digital systems (RAPID, IRIS) to support timely QA and data integrity for environmental monitoring.
