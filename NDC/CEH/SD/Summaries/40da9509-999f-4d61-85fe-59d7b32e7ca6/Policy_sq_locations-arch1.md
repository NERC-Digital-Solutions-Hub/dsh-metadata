# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Overview
  - Aimed at maximizing public-interest use of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners include CEH (Natural Environment Research Council), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Protects scientific integrity, environment, and future access/permissions to survey land.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH for UK FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations purposes.

- When release is allowed (and at what precision)
  - Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing each CS square.
  - Six-digit (precise) locations: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; the requesting organisation must show that their own IP/data carries equal or higher confidentiality than CS data, justifying external processing by CEH.
  - Spatial data within squares (habitats, features) could identify a square; released only under same exceptional terms as six-digit data.

- Conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and project-specific; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end.
  - No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality; do not use data to plan landowner visits or assess compliance.
  - If requested, provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar but more permissive IP/confidentiality terms; license terms prohibit attempts to derive precise locations or claim such capability.

- Licensing responsibilities and process
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases following policy principles.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences with required clauses; signed by a senior authorised official from the licensee.
  - If an approval is denied, CEH supports decision under the UK Act/Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to accommodate reasonable pre-processing analysis within a feasible timeframe for internal CS partnership use; requests from other organisations are considered case-by-case.
  - Analysts and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data covered by the policy; CEH may provide upfront scientific or collaborative support, potentially with payment.
