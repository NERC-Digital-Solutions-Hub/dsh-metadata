# Countryside Survey in 2007

## Purpose and scope
- National-level, standardized survey of freshwater and pond environments across Great Britain.
- Two primary components described: headwater river habitats (Rivers & Habitat Survey) and pond condition surveys (macrophyte and environmental assessments), plus related plant surveys (MTR) and water chemistry.
- Aims to produce interoperable, high-quality data to inform understanding of hydromorphology, biology, and water quality across CS2007 squares.

## Data collection domains and methods
- Headwaters (CS2007 Headwaters)
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling using RIVPACS methodology in a 500 m watercourse stretch.
  - Hydromorphological assessment via River Habitat Survey (RHS) within a 500 m reach.
  - Aquatic plant community survey (MTR macrophyte method) within a 100 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate site.
  - Water chemistry sampling at each headwater site: pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity; field measurements and on-site filtering for SRP/TON/alkalinity.
  - Photographs and exact site documentation to enable relocation and comparability with CS1990/CS2000 data.
- Pond Condition Survey
  - Identification and mapping of ponds within each square; selection of a survey pond per mapped square with comprehensive macrophyte and environmental assessments.
  - Pond mapping sheet workflow to document boundary, surface area, drawdown, turbidity, sediment/pond-base composition, inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, and surrounding land use.
  - Macrophyte survey within the pond boundary: submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species; abundance estimates; plant identifications with field and laboratory confirmation as needed.
  - Recording of shading, terrestrial/marine interfaces, and other pond features (grazing, waterbird usage, presence of fish/amphibians, and amenity values).
  - Documentation of pond management practices and surrounding land use within two distance zones (0-5 m and 0-100 m).
- Aquatic plant surveys (MTR/IRIS workflow)
  - 100 m macrophyte survey length with systematic recording of species presence and percent cover by category.
  - Plant identification guidance and specimen handling for confirmation of difficult taxa.
  - Use of field data systems (IRIS) for plant data entry; on-site validation and linking to CS square/pond IDs.

## Data capture, systems, and data quality
- On-site data capture tools
  - RHS: RAPID, a field digital data entry system on Tablet PC for recording RHS data; includes built-in validation and on-site data checks.
  - Macrophyte: IRIS, field digital data entry system for aquatic plant data; supports entry of species, abundance, and physical site data; validation on completion.
  - Macroinvertebrates: RIVPACS forms (Sample Area Form, environmental data, and sample handling) for recording macroinvertebrate results and site characteristics.
- Data validation and consistency
  - RAPID and IRIS include on-screen validation routines; error messages guide corrections before exiting on-site.
  - A field survey checklist ensures completion of all tasks before leaving the site.
  - Environment Agency RHS training and accreditation, plus periodic audits (approx. 7% of headwater sites) to ensure consistency with RHS2003 standards.
- Metadata and data standards
  - Key identifiers: CS square number, pond ID, NGR with at least 8-digit precision, date, surveyors’ initials, and sample method.
  - Units and measurement conventions specified (e.g., conductivity in µS cm-1, pH units, depth in cm, flow time in seconds per meter for velocity).
  - Standardized forms and templates (RIVPACS forms, RHS forms, MTR/IRIS templates) to ensure data interoperability across CS2007 datasets.

## Data storage, labeling, and transport
- Sample handling and labeling
  - Macroinvertebrate samples: multiple pots and formalin preservation; strong emphasis on thorough labeling with CS square, pond/sample IDs, date, and surveyor details.
  - Specimens for plant ID: pressed or preserved in alcohol (pickle) with proper labeling; vouchers sent to CEH Dorset for confirmation when needed.
- Transport and chain of custody
  - Samples stored in CEH base facilities; macroinvertebrate pots transported in labeled storage boxes with Transport Emergency Card (TREM) for formaldehyde-containing samples.
  - Boxes shipped to CEH Dorset in appropriate batches (typically 6-8 pots per box) with clear packaging and documentation; monthly dispatch schedule.
- Data submission to central bodies
  - Macroinvertebrate and plant specimens coordinated for processing and analysis by CEH staff; associated data submitted to Pond Conservation as part of the CS2007 workflow.

## Quality control and assurance
- Personnel and training
  - All field surveyors hold Environment Agency certificates for River Habitat Survey techniques and receive training in RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling and MTR aquatic plant methodologies.
  - Regular team rotations to minimize technique drift; periodic field presence by CEH staff for progress audit and quality feedback.
- Data integrity
  - On-site validation using RAPID/IRIS; Check Data routines ensure complete and consistent data entries before leaving sites.
  - Documentation and archiving of field data and specimens to maintain traceability and enable re-analysis if required.

## Practical workflow highlights (beginning, middle, end)
- Beginning
  - Preparatory mapping of ponds and headwater squares; equipment provisioning; safety planning; standardized data entry templates loaded on Tablet PCs.
- Middle
  - Field data collection across RHS, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, and water chemistry; on-site data entry; immediate validation; photography and relocation aids recorded.
  - Handling and labeling of samples; on-site logging of environmental data (width, depth, substrate, habitats, shading, water clarity); field sketches and site maps created for relocation.
- End
  - On-site data validation completed; samples prepared for transport; field survey checklists completed; samples dispatched to CEH Dorset and Pond Conservation; data integrated into RAPID/IRIS forms and prepared for central databases.
  - Final documentation and notes stored for QA and potential future re-surveys; data shared with partner organizations (e.g., Pond Conservation) for national analysis and reporting.

## Key challenges and data stewardship considerations
- Ensuring timely data transfer from field to central processing centers; maintaining rigorous labeling and chain-of-custody across macroinvertebrate and plant samples.
- Managing multiple interrelated data streams (RIVPACS, RHS/RAPID, IRIS) to ensure consistent metadata linkage to CS squares and ponds.
- Handling safety and accessibility issues in headwaters and ponds, with clear risk assessment guidelines and on-site decision points.
- Maintaining interoperability with historical CS datasets (CS1990/CS2000) while adopting the 2003 RHS framework for comparability.

## Takeaways for data stewards
- The CS2007 framework emphasizes standardized protocols, on-site digital data capture, rigorous validation, and robust sample labeling to ensure high-quality, shareable data across GB freshwater habitats.
- Clear metadata, defined identifiers, and validated data entry processes are central to discoverability and re-use by researchers and managers.
- Structured data flows, from field forms (RIVPACS/RHS/MTR) to central processing (CEH Dorset) and external sharing (Pond Conservation), support scalable, auditable, and interoperable datasets.
