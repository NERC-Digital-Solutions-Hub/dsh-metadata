# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- All other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include CEH (NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects future survey integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Aims to ensure continued ability to inform environmental policy.

## Circumstances for release and precision level
- Location data may be released at aggregated levels (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) to show square inclusion in areas.
- Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only released under very exceptional circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing exact locations.
- Spatial data from within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality and may be released only under exceptional terms.
- In exceptional cases, access requires demonstrating that competing data/products have equal or higher confidentiality protections.

## Specific licensing conditions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for defined projects; data must not be retained for other organizational duties.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and was destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to monitor individual landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality.

## Prohibited and precautionary uses
- Users must not attempt to derive precise square locations from released data.
- Data must not be used to identify or locate CS squares beyond the authorised purpose.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Licences must be signed by authorized representatives of the licensee organization.
- If a release is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; broader requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to work with CS location data; CEH may provide scientific input or collaborative support as agreed (may be paid or voluntary).

## Practical guidance for potential users
- Contact CEH early to discuss requirements and appropriate use.
- Ensure internal data-management practices align with licensing constraints.
- Be prepared to demonstrate legitimate need and adhere to confidentiality and destruction requirements at licence end.
