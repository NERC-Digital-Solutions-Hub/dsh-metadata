# Countryside Survey in 2007: Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey

- National-scale assessment conducted by CEH (NERC) for Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007), focusing on headwater streams and ponds across GB.
- Aims to identify ecological condition, habitat characteristics, and associated water-chemistry and plant/invertebrate data to inform policy and management decisions.
- Integrated data collection across multiple components and harmonised data capture with field-based digital systems to improve data quality and traceability.

## Key Components and Data Streams

- Headwaters (425 squares from CS2000 re-survey; 2007 focus):
  - Macroinvertebrate community data (RIVPACS-compatible sampling).
  - Aquatic plant community data (MTR method).
  - Hydromorphological characteristics (River Habitat Survey, RHS).
  - Physical watercourse characteristics and water chemistry (pH, conductivity; SRP, TON, alkalinity).
  - 500 m headwater sampling stretches; 50 m aquatic-plant survey segment; macroinvertebrate and chemistry sampling positioned near RHS spot-checks.
  - 25 squares re-sampled in headwater streams to replace >3rd-order sites, ensuring focus on headwaters.
- Ponds (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey):
  - Pond mapping and boundary delineation (outer winter water level boundary).
  - Macrophyte survey (MTR-inspired plant survey; 100 m reach around pond center around the macroinvertebrate point; submerged, floating-leaved, emergent, and bank-shade data).
  - Environmental survey data (land use, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, turbidity, and amenity factors).
  - Water chemistry sampling (pH, conductivity; SRP, TON, alkalinity; 50 ml filtered samples).
  - Field data captured on CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets; samples sent to Pond Conservation and CEH Dorset for processing.

## Data Capture, Systems & Workflow

- On-site data capture systems:
  - RHS and macroinvertebrate data entered into RAPID (River Habitat Survey field data entry system) on Tablet PC.
  - Aquatic plant survey data entered into IRIS (plant data entry system) on Tablet PC.
  - Macrophyte data integrated with standard MTR protocols; species lists and abundance categories standardized.
- Data integrity and validation:
  - RAPID and IRIS include built-in validation checks; data must pass on-site validation before leaving.
  - Field survey check-lists completed by both surveyors to ensure task completion.
- Sample handling and transport:
  - Macroinvertebrate samples fixed with formalin and stored in labeled pots; transport with TREM card and secure packaging.
  - Plant specimens identified in the lab; where necessary, samples sent to CEH Dorset for confirmation; strict labeling and chain-of-custody maintained.
- Documentation and lab submission:
  - Detailed sample information sheets (CS2007 forms) accompany water samples for laboratory analysis.
  - Plants and invertebrates stored and catalogued; monthly courier dispatch to CEH Dorset for processing and Pond Conservation for plant specimens.

## Headwaters: Methodology Highlights

- Sampling design:
  - 500 m sampling length per headwater site with a central macroinvertebrate sampling point; aquatic plant survey spans 100 m around this center.
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling area typically 5–15 m in width, using a standard pond-net (900 µm mesh) with three minutes of active sampling plus one minute of manual searching.
  - Random selection of RHS environmental data and water chemistry sampling points along the sampling stretch.
- Water chemistry protocol:
  - On-site measurement of conductivity and pH (Hanna Combi meter) with two-point calibration; filtered samples collected for SRP, TON, and alkalinity (0.45 µm syringe filters; 50 ml bottles).
  - Detailed sample-handling instructions, including labeling, filtration procedure, and transport to CEH Lancaster.
- Macroinvertebrate processing:
  - Emphasis on collecting a broad range of taxa; preserve samples for lab identification; avoid disruption to sensitive taxa (e.g., large crayfish, pearls mussel) and document presence when released.
  - Manual searches (two parts totaling one minute) supplement the main 3-minute kick-sweep sample to capture taxa in less accessible microhabitats.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS):
  - RHS data captured via RAPID; 500 m reach anchored on macroinvertebrate sampling site; focus on hydromorphology and associated environmental variables.
  - Sectioned data entry across 4 pages with 17 sections; spot-checks (1, 6, and 10) include GPS verification and proportional habitat recording.
  - Validation and relocation features embedded to ensure data quality and site re-locatability.
- Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR-based):
  - 100 m MTR survey length; walk/wade to record macrophyte presence and percent cover on a 9-point scale across submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent categories.
  - Systematic, repeatable cover estimation using standardized methods and reference visual aids; specimens collected for lab confirmation where necessary.
  - Data integrated with species lists (351 taxa targeted) and a strong emphasis on rare species confirmation and proper specimen handling.

## Pond Condition Survey: Key Procedures

- Mapping and survey pond selection:
  - All ponds in a square mapped; a survey pond selected per square for macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry assessments.
  - Ponds defined as standing water bodies between 25 m2 and 2 ha, typically holding water for at least four months annually.
- Field activities within the pond:
  - Photo documentation; boundary sketching; measurement of pond area, drawdown height, and proportion of water present relative to maximum water level.
  - Sediment and pond-base characterization; assessment of sediment depth, depth measurements at multiple transects; turbidity estimation.
  - Pollution and inflow/outflow assessment; recording of potential pollution sources and flow characteristics when present.
- Macrophyte survey within pond:
  - Macrophyte survey across the outer pond boundary; 100 m reach within the pond; identification and abundance categorization for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species.
  - Specimen collection and identification, including guidance on rare species and sample submission for expert confirmation.
  - Documentation of bank overhang and surrounding land use; assessment of shade and amenity value.
- Data capture and QA for ponds:
  - CS2007 Pond Condition Sheets completed (Survey Recording Sheets 1-3) with detailed data on water quality, environmental attributes, and macrophyte data.
  - Specimens and field data transported to Pond Conservation and CEH; monthly mailings and careful labeling to maintain data integrity.

## Quality Assurance, Safety & Governance

- Training and certification:
  - All field surveyors hold Environment Agency RHS macroinvertebrate sampling certificates; trained in RIVPACS macroinvertebrate methods and MTR macrophyte protocols.
- Audits and consistency:
  - Regular team rotation to maintain consistency across sampling techniques; approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff.
  - Field surveys supported by on-site supervision and real-time data validation via RAPID and IRIS.
- Safety:
  - Standard health and safety protocols for working near water; risk assessment performed for each site, with avoidance of high-risk conditions.
  - Pond surveys require two surveyors for safety; recognition of potential hazards such as floating mats, deep silt, and unstable banks.

## Data Outputs and Accessibility

- Primary data storage:
  - On-site data capture via RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (macrophytes); macroinvertebrate data ultimately integrated with RIVPACS-compatible outputs.
- Sample handling documentation:
  - Detailed labeling, transport, and storage protocols; TREM cards for hazardous materials; chain-of-custody maintained for all samples.
- Reporting and integration:
  - Data designed to feed national biodiversity indicators, conduct comparability across sites, and support future trend analyses.
  - Forestalls data fragmentation by centralizing field data capture and ensuring dataset discoverability via metadata and standardized formats.

## Summary for Analysts

- CS2007 implements a comprehensive, standardized, field-based data collection framework for headwater streams and ponds, combining biological (macroinvertebrates, macrophytes) and physical/chemical data with robust GIS-ready location data.
- Key data streams include:
  - RIVPACS-based macroinvertebrate sampling with 3-minute kick-nets plus 1-minute manual search; 500 m RHS-derived context; 50 m plant survey; on-site water chemistry sampling.
  - MTR-based aquatic/macrophyte surveys across 100 m pond/channel segments; detailed abundance scoring and specimen collection for lab confirmation.
  - RHS hydromorphological and environmental profiling captured via RAPID with built-in validation; history of site relocation features and standardized reporting.
  - Pond condition: mapping, boundary delineation, 3D context (area, drawdown, turbidity), macrophyte assemblage, environmental variables, and land-use surround.
- Data integrity is achieved through:
  - Pre-defined field protocols, on-site validation, standardized drop-down data entry, meticulous labeling, and secure sample handling.
  - Regular QA audits, team rotations, and transport/handling procedures to prevent contamination and mislabeling.
- Outputs enable correlations between hydromorphology, water chemistry, biotic communities, and habitat quality, supporting ecological status assessments, trend analyses, and policy-relevant recommendations across GB freshwater systems.
