# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aim: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- CS partners: CEH (Natural Environment Research Council), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- These elements sustain the scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and future survey permission.
- The policy is considered in the public interest; requests are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Access allows identification of whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require CEH pre-processing to avoid release; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases, external release under licence may be allowed if IP confidentiality is similarly protected.
- Spatial data within squares (habitats, linear features) carry equivalent risk and are released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.

## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licensing end.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data should not be used to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP-confidentiality standard.
- License terms for spatial data and four-digit references prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences reflecting policy terms; licences must be signed by a senior authorised official.
- If access is denied, CEH follows FOI/Environmental Information Regulations procedures to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal partner use, CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to CS location data use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
