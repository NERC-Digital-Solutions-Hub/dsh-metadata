Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximize public-interest utility of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for future surveys, environmental protection, and credible policy influence.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Allowed for location identification at predetermined levels (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) with four-digit grid references (approximate 10x10 km area) under licence.
- Precise six-digit grid references (1x1 km) require CEH to perform pre-processing analyses if possible; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may these be released externally under licence.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are subject to the same exceptional-access terms.
- Four-digit releases require that users not attempt to derive precise square locations; data must not be used to identify landowner locations or to plan visits.

## Conditions of release and licensing
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are granted for finite periods and for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licensing period for other duties.
- At the end of a licence, organizations must confirm destruction of location data.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Licensees must provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP if requested.
- The four-digit licence terms are similar to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP-protection criteria.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions and issues hard-copy licences with appropriate clauses.
- CEH supports decision-reasoning and, where approved, issues licences signed by an authorized senior signatory.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows Act and Regulations in the supporting decision.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS-partner use, CEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; requests from other organizations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with CEH before using data covered by this policy to define requirements and/or support appropriate use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
