# Headwaters

- Scope and purpose
  - Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) headwater module re-surveys freshwater habitats across GB.
  - Aims to produce map-based, explorable data on headwater streams and ponds for policy, clients, and public audiences.
  - Integrates macroinvertebrate (RIVPACS), aquatic plant (MTR/RHS) data, hydromorphological characteristics, and water chemistry to support spatial analysis.

- Spatial coverage and sampling design
  - Re-survey all 425 squares previously surveyed in CS2000 (freshwater module).
  - For headwater streams in each square: re-survey macroinvertebrate community, hydromorphological characteristics, water chemistry, and associated environmental data.
  - In 629 CS2007 squares containing ponds: survey one randomly selected pond for aquatic plant community, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Headwaters sampling length: 500 m total watercourse; aquatic plant survey stretch: 100 m centered on macroinvertebrate sampling point.
  - New headwater sampling sites: 25 of the 425 squares will replace CS2000 sites on third-order+ streams to improve focus on headwaters.

- Data collection methods and standards
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS-based)
    - Standardized 3-minute kick-net sampling with a 25 cm2 pond-net (900 µm mesh) plus a mandatory 1-minute manual search.
    - Sampling is habitat-proportional within a single continuous sampling area (5–15 m typical; varies with stream width).
    - Two-field roles: A and B surveyors coordinate sampling, fixing, and data entry; strict sequencing to maximize taxa capture.
    - Sample area environmental data collected (width, depth, velocity category, substrate, site features) using RIVPACS Sample Area Form.
    - Sample handling emphasizes clean nets, minimal water, appropriate fixatives, and detailed labelling (form fields and labels).
  - Water chemistry
    - On-site field measurements: conductivity and pH (Hanna Combi meter); SRP, TON, and alkalinity via filtered 50 ml samples.
    - On-site filtration with 0.45 µm syringe filters; careful bottle labeling and packaging for laboratory analysis.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - Hydromorphological assessment over a 500 m reach; RHS data entered in the RAPID field system.
    - 10 spot-check transects (with detailed spot-check data per page 2), plus RHS overall vegetation and substrate summary.
    - On-site data validation via RAPID; if RHS cannot be completed, site still entered with notes.
  - Data systems and quality control
    - On-site data entry: RAPID (River Habitat Survey) for RHS data; IRIS for aquatic plant (MTR) data; field forms mirror 2003 RHS and MTR methodologies.
    - Validation: RAPID and IRIS perform sequential data checks; errors corrected on-site; “This RHS survey appears to be complete” or similar messages confirm completion.
    - Quality control: EA RHS certification, formal training in RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling and MTR plant surveys; ~7% of headwater sites audited; field teams rotated for consistency.

- Field procedures and documentation
  - Site positioning and relocation
    - Exact NC coordinate data via NGR (GPS); site maps and relocation markers (MPR/spot-check boards) used to relocate sites for future surveys.
    - Sketch maps drawn on site to capture channel form, landmarks, and sampling extent for relocation.
  - Photographs
    - Photos of macroinvertebrate sampling area, RHS reach, and plant survey area with markers for relocation.
  - Sample storage and transport
    - Macroinvertebrate samples stored in labeled pots/bags with 40% formalin to achieve ~4% formaldehyde strength; transport in CEH containers with Transport Emergency Card (TREM).
    - Shipments to CEH Dorset in batches (6–8 pots per box); courier noted; sample labeling must match CS square and pond/invert IDs.
  - Field survey checklist
    - Joint completion by both surveyors to ensure all tasks have been performed; completed before leaving site.

- Pond Condition Survey (CS2007)
  - Overview
    - Mapping of ponds in each square by mappers; identify a “survey pond” per square when ponds exist (standing water 25 m2 to 2 ha, water ≥4 months/year).
    - Two surveyors cooperate to minimize safety risks; steps include pond mapping, macrophyte survey, environmental survey, and water chemistry.
  - Pond mapping and condition recording
    - CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets collect water quality, environmental, and pond condition data; 3 consistent data sheets (water quality, environmental, macrophyte) support integrated analysis.
  - Macrophyte survey (MTR)
    - Aquatic macrophytes recorded along a 100 m reach (centered on macroinvertebrate sampling point), including submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species.
    - Survey technique emphasizes systematic wading and grapnel use for submerged plants; detached material to be collected only for identification.
    - Abundance estimates use a 9-category scale; percentage cover estimates are converted to species-level cover values using a standardized method (tables and guidance provided).
    - Species identification aims for to-species level where possible; rare species flagged; specimens collected for laboratory confirmation when needed.
  - Data entry and validation
    - IRIS used for plant data; 2-page input form with drop-downs to minimize free text; on-site validation before leaving the pond site.
    - "No species entered" option available when pond has no recorded plants; physical data still captured.
  - Pond environmental and physical data
    - Recording includes pond boundaries, drawdown height, water area, turbidity, sediment and pond base composition, inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, pond management, surrounding land use, and amenity value.
    - Habitat and shading assessments capture land use in 0–5 m and 0–100 m zones around the pond; amenity access and use documented.
  - Documentation and sample handling
    - Samples and specimens returned to Pond Conservation; identification keys and guidance provided; rare species handling follows legal and ethical guidelines (Wildlife and Countryside Act Schedule 8).
  - Pond-specific field practices
    - Photographs and sketches support site relocation; measurement of water chemistry and turbidity performed before disturbance where possible.
    - Drawdown height measured with pond net handle; pond area estimated by pacing and shape approximation; drawdown, depth, and sediment/pond-base composition recorded with standardized scales.

- Outputs and GIS relevance
  - Spatial data products
    - Spatially explicit records for 425 CS2000 squares (headwaters) and pond locations across squares, with NGR coordinates and standardized square identifiers.
    - 500 m RHS reach and 100 m MTR reach data provide detailed spatial profiles of hydromorphology and macrophyte distribution within each site.
  - Data integration
    - Data feed into RIVPACS (macroinvertebrates), RHS/RAPID (hydromorphology), IRIS (macrophytes), and pond-specific datasets for mapping and policy-relevant analyses.
  - Data quality and standards
    - Emphasis on consistent spatial references (NGR; 8-digit grid references where available), standardized forms, on-site validation, and cross-team QA to ensure GIS-ready datasets.
  - Practical GIS workflows
    - Standardized site relocation sketches and GPS data enable precise time-series comparisons.
    - Field forms and digital data entry systems (RAPID, IRIS) reduce post-field data cleaning and enable direct GIS-ready datasets for landscape and habitat analyses.

- Key practitioner notes for GIS teams
  - Ensure accurate geospatial tagging of each sampling site (NGR/8-digit grid references) and link to square identifiers for seamless GIS indexing.
  - Leverage RHS and MTR outputs to build multi-layer map products (hydromorphology, habitat types, vegetation cover, water chemistry) for policy and public-facing maps.
  - Maintain traceable data lineage from field forms to digital databases (RAPID, IRIS) and on to centralized CEH repositories.
  - Emphasize standardized field boundaries (500 m RHS reach, 100 m MTR reach) to enable consistent spatial comparisons across squares and years.
