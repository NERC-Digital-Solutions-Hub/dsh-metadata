# CS2007 Pond Condition Survey

- Comprehensive field manual for Countryside Survey 2007 focusing on pond and headwater stream condition across GB.
- Integrates macroinvertebrate, macrophyte, hydromorphological, and water-chemistry data within standardized field protocols.

## Key aims and outputs

- Produce data and data products to enable exploration and interpretation of freshwater condition across survey squares.
- Core outputs include RIVPACS macroinvertebrate data, River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology data, macrophyte/Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) plant data, and associated environmental measurements.
- Emphasis on self-service tools and on-site data validation to ensure data quality and comparability with prior CS surveys.

## Survey scope and design

- Headwaters module (CS2007) re-surveys:
  - All 425 CS2000 headwater squares (streams) with macroinvertebrate, aquatic plant, RHS/hydromorphological, physical characteristics, and water chemistry data.
  - 25 squares with new headwater sampling sites to focus on appropriate headwater conditions.
- Pond module:
  - Identify all ponds in each CS square; select one survey pond per square for detailed condition assessment.
  - Pond survey includes macrophyte community, environmental characteristics, and water chemistry.

## Data collection framework and components

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS-compatible)
  - Target: widest possible taxa within a single 5–15 m sampling area; three-minute kick-net sampling with optional manual search (total about 4 minutes).
  - Equipment: standard pond-net, 900 μm mesh; fixation with 40% formaldehyde; sample labeling and storage in 1.3 L pots.
  - Documentation: RIVPACS Sample Area Form capturing site, method, depth, width, substrate, and environmental context; photograph site and sampling area.
- Water chemistry and physical parameters (headwaters)
  - On-site conductivity and pH (hand-held meters) with field calibration.
  - Indicative water chemistry: filtered SRP, TON, and alkalinity using on-site filtration (0.45 μm filters) and 50 ml bottles; detailed sample labeling per project code and square.
  - Detailed sampling instructions and forms (Figure 3 information sheet) to ensure traceability.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS) data
  - 500 m reaches centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site; 10 spot-checks plus vegetation and substrate sections.
  - Data capture via RAPID field system (MS Access); on-site validation and reportable checks to ensure completeness before leaving site.
  - RHS variables include width, depth, velocity, substratum, bank/top vegetation, channel shading, and water clarity; RHS employs 2003 Environment Agency methodology with on-site data validation.
- Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR)
  - 100 m reach (within pond boundaries for ponds; 50 m upstream and downstream from macroinvertebrate center for 100 m survey in ponds) to record presence and percent cover of macrophytes and bryophytes.
  - Data capture via IRIS (field digital system) with plant lists, abundance categories, and sampling notes; specimens may be collected for lab confirmation.
  - Species identification guided by standard flora references; emphasis on identifying rare or suspicious taxa, with guidance for sending samples to experts.
- Macrophyte sampling and lab workflow
  - Specimen handling and identification protocols for Callitriche, Potamogeton, Ranunculus groups, etc.; recommended routine specimens for lab confirmation.
  - Rare species confirmation workflow with caution due to legal protections; use of digital photos when possible for verification.
- Pond condition survey (CS2007)
  - Field mapping prior to condition assessment; define outer pond boundary and winter water level.
  - Environmental survey: land use around pond, inflows/outflows, amenity use, and signs of management or livestock interaction.
  - Macrophyte survey within pond boundary: records of submerged, floating-leaved, emergent species; grapnel sampling for submerged plants where safe; specimen handling and potential extraction for lab ID.
  - Water quality and turbidity assessment: turbidity categories; on-site conductivity and pH; SRP/TON/Alkalinity sampling with filtration; 50 ml bottles; labeling per CS square and pond code.
  - Documentation: pond boundary sketch, pond area estimation, drawdown height, and pond sediment/base composition.
  - Data capture via CS2007 Pond Condition Survey sheets, with separate sheets for water quality, environmental survey, and macrophyte survey.
- Data handling and transport
  - Specimens labeled, stored, and shipped to CEH Dorset (with TREM transport cards for formaldehyde-containing samples).
  - Guidelines for packing, labeling, and dispatch cadence (aim for monthly shipments); coverage includes macroinvertebrate pots and plant specimens.
  - On-site coordination: two surveyors per headwater site; tasks allocated for efficiency and safety.
  - Documentation and checklists to ensure completeness and data integrity before departure.

## Data quality, validation, and governance

- On-site data validation with RAPID and IRIS; built-in checks identify missing or inconsistent entries, requiring correction before leaving the site.
- Regular QA measures:
  - All field surveyors hold Environment Agency RHS/RIVPACS credentials.
  - Regular cross-training, team swaps, and periodic audits (~7% of headwater sites) by CEH staff.
  - Field survey checklist completed jointly by both surveyors to prevent omissions.
- Data management protocols emphasize linkage between field data and laboratory analysis, with standardized labeling, coding, and sample tracking.

## Safety and logistics

- Clear health and safety guidance for fieldwork in streams and ponds, including risk assessments and safety equipment.
- Transport safety via TREM cards; formaldehyde and other chemicals require careful handling and appropriate labeling.
- Coordinated dispatch and documentation to CEH Dorset for processing and storage.

## Summary of data products and integration

- RIVPACS: macroinvertebrate community data and environmental variables.
- RHS: river habitat survey indices and hydromorphological data, entered via RAPID.
- IRIS: aquatic macrophyte survey data (species, abundance, and physical site data).
- Pond Condition Survey sheets: structured data on pond area, drawdown, sediment/pond base, inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, and amenity-use data.
- The CS2007 framework supports national-scale comparison (CS2007 vs CS2000) and integration of headwater and pond data for GB freshwater condition assessments.
