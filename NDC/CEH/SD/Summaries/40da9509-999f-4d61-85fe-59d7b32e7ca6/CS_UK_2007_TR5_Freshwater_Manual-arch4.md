# Countryside Survey in 2007

- A nationwide field survey program designed to assess freshwater systems (headwaters, ponds, and streams) across Great Britain, with data collection workflows, quality controls, and digital data management to support data-driven decision making and policy.

## Key Aims for Data Leaders

- Ensure consistent, high-quality data assets across the freshwater components of CS2007 (headwaters, pond condition, macrophyte surveys, and associated chemistry).
- Implement end-to-end data pipelines from field collection to central repositories and downstream analyses, with on-site validation and standardized metadata.
- Promote data discoverability, interoperability, and governance across platforms and partners (e.g., CEH Dorset, Pond Conservation).

## Data Assets and Structure

- Macroinvertebrate data (RIVPACS) including:
  - Macroinvertebrate community samples, sampling area definitions, environmental data, water chemistry, and hydromorphological variables.
  - RIVPACS Sample Area Form for site-level environmental data; standardised recording of width, depth, substratum, habitats, and chemistry.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS) data:
  - Hydromorphological indices collected along 500 m reaches; 3-part field process (A-B-C sections) with spot-checks, bank/top attributes, and channel features.
  - Use of RAPID (field data entry system) for RHS data capture with built-in validation.
- Aquatic plant data (MTR) and macrophyte surveys:
  - 100 m macrophyte survey length; species presence, abundance categories, and percentage cover estimates.
  - IRIS as the field data entry system for plant surveys, including species lists, cover codes, and physical site data.
- Pond Condition Survey data:
  - Pond Mapping Recording Sheets (mapping and boundary extents) and a separate pond condition field sheet capturing water quality, environmental characteristics, macrophyte presence, and pond management factors.
  - Measurements include turbidity, pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity, drawdown height, pond area, sediment composition, inflows/outflows, land use, and amenity factors.
- Sample logistics and lab handoffs:
  - Formaldehyde-fixed macroinvertebrate samples, labelling conventions, and transport to CEH Dorset with Transport Emergency Cards (TREM) and pre-specified dispatch frequencies.
  - Specimen preservation guidance for plants (pressed or pickled) and guidance for rare species verification.

## Data Capture Systems and Quality Control

- On-site digital data capture:
  - RAPID: River Habitat Survey data capture in the field; page-based forms with drop-downs, on-site validation, and a “Check Data” routine to ensure completeness before leaving site.
  - IRIS: Aquatic macrophyte data capture; two-page form for plant lists and site physical data with on-site validation.
- Data validation and integrity:
  - Mandatory on-site checks to ensure data completeness; single-error prompts to enable immediate correction.
  - Regular auditing: ~7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; staff rotated to maintain consistency; field survey checklists completed by both surveyors.
- Metadata and traceability:
  - Each data point linked to CS square, pond or headwater site, date, NGR, surveyors, and sampling method; site relocatability supported by sketch maps and relocation features.
- Data sharing and governance:
  - Macroinvertebrate and plant data routed for laboratory analysis and central storage; field data and specimens coordinated with Pond Conservation; reporting and archiving procedures defined.

## Field Sampling Protocols (Headwaters and Ponds)

- Headwaters (CS2007):
  - Coverage: re-survey all CS2000 headwater squares (425 squares) with macroinvertebrate sampling, RHS hydromorphology, plant community survey, and water chemistry.
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS):
    - Single 500 m continuous sampling area with a 5–15 m sampling stretch; three-minute pond-net sampling plus one minute of manual search; proportional sampling of habitats.
    - Use a 25 cm2 pond-net with 900 μm mesh; repeat washes to prevent clogging; preserve with 40% formalin to achieve ~4% formaldehyde liquor.
    - All specimens kept for lab identification except fish/amphibians/large rares which are returned to the site.
    - Environmental data (width, depth, velocity, substratum, and habitats) captured on RIVPACS Sample Area Form; photographs taken for relocation.
  - Water chemistry:
    - One indicative water sample per headwater site; field measurements for pH and conductivity; filtered samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity using disposable syringe filters.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS) and data handling:
  - 500 m RHS with on-site data capture (RAPID) and subsequent validation; field guidance aligned to 2003 RHS protocol; ensures comparability with updated RHS indices.
- Macrophyte survey and MTR:
  - 100 m MTR (macrophyte survey) within the macroinvertebrate reach; presence and percent cover of submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent macrophytes recorded.
  - Species identification to the extent possible; collection and lab confirmation for difficult taxa; large emphasis on rare species verification.
  - Macrophyte sampling uses a 100 m reach with structured percentage-cover estimation (Table 3 and 4 guidance) to quantify community composition.
- Ponds (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey):
  - Ponds identified and mapped via CS2000 mapping; the survey pond is selected within ponds in a square to conduct macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry assessments.
  - Procedures include boundary delineation, sketching outlines, estimating pond area, drawdown height, proportion of water, sediment/pond base composition, and pollution indicators.
  - Water chemistry and turbidity recorded where possible; detailed recording of inflows/outflows, land use in surrounding zones, and amenity values.
  - Macrophyte survey within pond boundary uses a comprehensive species list with abundance estimates; rare species verification required; specimen handling and lab submission guidance provided.
- Sample labeling and transport:
  - Labeling conventions, sample containers, and preservation steps (formaldehyde for macroinvertebrates; alcohol for charophytes) follow strict protocols.
  - Transit: macroinvertebrate and plant samples stored in CEH storage boxes; dispatch to CEH Dorset monthly (minimum 6–8 pots per box); TREM card attached to transport box; email notification of shipment.

## Data Use, Outputs and Communities

- On-site data capture feeds into central databases (RAPID, IRIS) for RHS and macrophyte data, enabling immediate quality checks and faster data availability for analysis and reporting.
- Data products include:
  - RIVPACS macroinvertebrate-based assessments (for water quality and ecological status).
  - MTR macrophyte-based trophic/vegetation indices.
  - RHS hydromorphological indices for river habitat quality.
  - Pond condition indicators (macrophyte composition, turbidity, pollution indicators, and land-use context).

## Practical Considerations and Challenges

- Safety and logistics:
  - Fieldwork involves water, weather, and habitat safety; end-to-end health and safety checks; paired surveyors with risk assessment and decision rules for high/moderate risk conditions.
- Data consistency and continuity:
  - Regular training and accreditation, team rotations, and standardized data capture formats to maintain consistency across years and teams.
- Data richness versus accessibility:
  - Comprehensive field data (habitat, chemistry, biology, macroscale geomorphology) are captured, stored, and made available for policy and research while maintaining rigorous provenance and metadata.
- Collaboration and governance:
  - Coordination with Pond Conservation for pond data and specimen handling; CEH Datastore and Dorset lab processing; clear procedures for sample transfer, storage, and reporting.

## Summary for Data Leaders

- CS2007 provides a robust, end-to-end data pipeline for freshwater ecosystems, emphasizing standardized field methodologies, digital data capture (RAPID, IRIS), rigorous quality control (on-site validation, audits), and clear data governance for end-user usability.
- Data assets are richly described with location, timing, methods, and sample lineage, enabling long-term comparability and cross-program integration (headwaters, RHS, MTR, ponds).
- The program demonstrates cross-stakeholder data sharing with Pond Conservation and centralized lab processing, underscoring the importance of interoperable data standards, metadata, and timely data delivery for policy-relevant insights.
