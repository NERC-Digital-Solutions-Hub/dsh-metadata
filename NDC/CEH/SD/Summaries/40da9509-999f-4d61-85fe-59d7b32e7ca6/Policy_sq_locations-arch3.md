# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: Maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH), Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Natural England (NE), Welsh Government (WG), Scottish Government (SG), Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), Forestry Commission (FC), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).

- Rationale for confidentiality of square locations:
  - Preserves representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for scientific integrity of sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future landowner permissions.
  - Compromising confidentiality could undermine future surveys and policy-relevant insights.

- Public-interest stance and oversight:
  - Requests for information handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Circumstances for location release and precision levels:
  - Approximate locations: four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released to help determine whether squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Precise locations: six-digit grid references require CEH pre-processing to avoid release; very exceptional external release may be granted if the requester demonstrates that the associated IP/data carries equal or higher confidentiality.
  - Spatial data within squares (habitats, linear features) could be used to identify square location and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

- Specific conditions of release:
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality; data stored securely and accessed only by named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite, project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
  - Upon licence end, licensees must confirm destruction of location data.
  - No release to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; clauses prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations.

- Roles and responsibilities:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - Licensing decisions follow UK Act and Regulations; denied approvals documented with rationale.
  - CEH provides annual reports to CS partners summarising access applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe, subject to moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data under this policy; CEH involvement may be direct or via negotiated collaboration or payment.
