Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Who the CS partners are
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for survey integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission for future surveys.
- Confidentiality is considered in the public interest; FOI/Environmental Information Regulations processes apply for requests, mediated by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners.

## When and how locations may be released
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing a square.
- Precise locations (six-digit grid references): only in very exceptional cases; CEH may preprocess instead of releasing raw locations; if released, must meet stringent conditions.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) can reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to approved individuals.
- Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed upon licence expiry.
- No data or outputs should be shared with third parties that could reveal square locations.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have a slightly lower IP confidentiality hurdle than six-digit releases.
- License terms prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, approves exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; senior sign-off required from the licensee organisation.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications and decisions.
- CEH can provide pre-processing analysis support within reasonable demand; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement varies by collaborative or paid arrangements.
