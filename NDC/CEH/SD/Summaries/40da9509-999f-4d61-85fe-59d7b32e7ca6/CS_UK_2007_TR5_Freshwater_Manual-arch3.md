# Countryside Survey 2007 Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey

- Authors and affiliation: John Murphy and Anita Weatherby, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (Natural Environment Research Council); November 2008.
- Scope: A standardized monitoring framework for evaluating environmental health across headwaters (streams) and ponds in Great Britain as part of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007), with data collection, management, and quality assurance protocols to inform policy decisions and future actions.
- Core aim for authors of monitoring frameworks perspective: provide auditable, comparable measures of watercourse condition, enabling scrutiny of policy impacts and guiding future monitoring investments.

## Monitoring framework design and objectives

- Establish standardized, policy-relevant environmental health indicators for policy scrutiny and future decision-making.
- Ensure data are verifiable, openly shareable where possible, and governed by clear data management standards.
- Balance data quality and accessibility by addressing metadata gaps, facilitating data provenance, and promoting reuse while managing governance.
- Promote stakeholder engagement and learning to avoid duplication and ensure measures are informative and actionable.

## Scope and survey design

- CS2007 integrates two aquatic modules:
  - Headwaters (freshwater headwater streams) across 425 CS2000 squares; re-survey of macroinvertebrate community, River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology, aquatic plant community, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Ponds across 629 CS2007 squares; random pond sampling within squares containing ponds; pond condition assessment including macrophyte survey, environmental characteristics, and water chemistry.
- Headwaters specifics:
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling and RHS data collected across 500 m stretches; aquatic plant and water chemistry within a 100 m central reach around macroinvertebrate sampling point; RHS data captured using updated 2003 Environment Agency methods.
  - All 425 CS2000 headwater squares revisited; 25 squares include a new headwater site on a smaller watercourse to optimise sampling focus.
- Pond specifics:
  - Ponds identified in mapping; one “survey pond” per square where ponds exist; a pond condition survey covers macrophytes, environmental characteristics, and water chemistry.

## Data capture, tools, and data governance

- Data capture systems:
  - RIVPACS: manual and automated environmental data capture for macroinvertebrate sampling in headwaters.
  - RHS (River Habitat Survey): 500 m RHS segment, captured in the field using RAPID (MS Access) on Tablet PC; subsequent data validation and storage in RAPID.
  - IRIS: aquatic plant survey field data entry system for MTR/macrophyte data; supports species lists, abundance coding, and specimen handling.
- Data flow and validation:
  - On-site data entry with built-in validation to identify missing or inconsistent fields; iterative correction until “This RHS survey appears to be complete” or equivalent plant survey confirmation is achieved.
  - Transfer of field data and specimens to CEH Dorset for processing; use of Transport Emergency Card (TREM) for formaldehyde-containing samples.
- Metadata and openness:
  - Emphasis on documenting site coordinates (NGR), sampling methods, and environmental context; explicit procedures for labeling and tracking samples to ensure traceability and data provenance.

## Methods and procedures

- Headwaters macroinvertebrate sampling and environment:
  - Primary objective: maximize taxa collected from a single continuous sampling area (5–15 m, depending on width) representative of the site’s habitats.
  - Sampling method: standard 25 cm2 pond-net with 900 µm mesh; three minutes of active sampling plus one minute of manual searching; sampling area proportionally covers all habitat types present.
  - Sample handling: frequent net washing to prevent clogging; retain most material; avoid collecting fish/amphibians or clearly rare specimens in the sample; retain all specimens for lab identification.
  - Labelling and preservation: fixed with 4% formaldehyde to achieve ~4% formaldehyde liquor; multiple bags/pots as needed; thorough labeling and storage for transit to CEH.
- Macroinvertebrate workflow and data:
  - Sample area environmental data recorded on the RIVPACS Sample Area Form, including width, depth, substrate, velocity, and habitat types; photography of sampling area and features to aid relocation.
- Water chemistry:
  - Indicative chemical sample at each headwater site; on-site field measurements for conductivity and pH using Hanna Combi meter (two-point calibration); filtered water samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity using 0.45 µm filters; sample handling and labeling instructions to labs at CEH.
- Hydromorphology and habitat data (RHS):
  - RHS 2003 protocol; field data captured via RAPID; 500 m RHS centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site; 10 spot-checks plus vegetation and substrate summaries; on-site validation required.
  - Documentation includes a detailed form layout, shading, channel width/depth, bed stability, substrate composition, and habitat typing (Pool, Run, Riffle, Slack) with percentage covers.
- Aquatic plants (macrophytes) and MTR:
  - Macrophyte survey (MTR-based) covers a 100 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate site; walk/wade to record presence and relative abundance of submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species; specimen collection for later lab confirmation where identification in field is uncertain; detailed percentage-cover estimation guidelines and systematic approaches to avoid under-sampling small patches.
  - Species identification aimed to species-level where feasible; a standard list of taxa provided; guidance on rare/uncertain identifications and sample submission for laboratory confirmation; records of plant specimens sent for ID and the protocol for labeling specimens.
- Pond condition survey protocol:
  - Initial pond mapping and boundary identification; definition of pond area (25 m2 to 2 ha) and winter water level; drawing outlines and calculating pond area; drawdown height and water depth measurements across transects; sediment and pond base composition estimates; pollution/inflow/outflow assessments; pond management, grazing, waterbird and fish/amphibian indicators; surrounding land use and amenity values.
  - Water quality and turbidity: turbidity estimate prior to disturbance, conductivity and pH measurements, SRP/TON/alkalinity samples with on-site filtration and lab submission.
  - Macrophyte survey within the pond boundary: comprehensive listing of plant taxa, abundance categories, and total submerged/ emergent/ floating-leaved coverage; handling of rare or difficult taxa with specimen submission or expert confirmation; documentation of shading by overhanging vegetation.
- Ponds in field logistics:
  - Post-survey sample handling and shipping (to Pond Conservation, CEH Dorset) with appropriate packaging and labeling; TREM card for road transport; monthly dispatch cadence.

## Quality assurance, safety, and governance

- Training and accreditation:
  - All field surveyors are certified RHS practitioners and trained in RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling and MTR/macrophyte surveying; teams rotated to minimise drift in technique over time.
- Auditing and data integrity:
  - Approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH; field surveys validated on-site; use of RAPID and IRIS to minimize transcription errors; mandatory field survey checklists to ensure completion and consistency.
- Safety and risk management:
  - Explicit health and safety considerations for fieldwork in streams and ponds; risk assessments for high-risk conditions; two-person field teams for pond surveys; safety equipment and procedures for sampling in aquatic environments.
- Data sharing and governance:
  - Emphasis on transparent metadata, traceability, and sharing where possible; standardized forms and data entry platforms to support integration with policy-relevant monitoring and future analyses.

## Outputs, dissemination, and practical notes

- Field forms and digital tools:
  - RIVPACS, RHS (RAPID), IRIS, and associated sample sheets constitute the core data collection and validation toolkit.
- Sample handling and courier logistics:
  - Clear protocols for sample labeling, fixatives, storage, and timely transport to CEH Dorset; TREM cards and CEH contact protocols for emergencies and sample tracking.
- Ponds and headwaters outputs:
  - Comprehensive datasets for headwater macroinvertebrates, RHS hydromorphology, plant communities, and water chemistry; pond macrophyte, environmental, and water-quality data; combined with field maps, photographs, and relocation aids to ensure repeatability.

## Key challenges and considerations for monitoring framework authors

- Data gaps and access barriers:
  - Recognize and address possible lack of high-quality data and timely data access; encourage data sharing while navigating metadata gaps and governance requirements.
- Silos and integration:
  - Tackle organizational silos by standardizing data collection and governance across agencies; promote interoperability of datasets (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR/macrophyte data).
- Communicating complex findings:
  - Provide clear, interpretable outputs (charts, dashboards, and maps) to inform policymakers and stakeholders.
- Maintaining up-to-date datasets:
  - Implement processes to keep metadata, protocols, and datasets current and publicly shareable where feasible.
