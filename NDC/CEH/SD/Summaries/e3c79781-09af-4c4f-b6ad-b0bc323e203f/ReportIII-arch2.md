# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and aim
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders).
  - Aimed to provide a broad, standardized monitoring context for the field experiment, enabling links to other data and year-to-year comparisons.
  - Baseline data and measurement types were defined to support cross-project data interpretation and comparisons.

- Data collection and management (overview)
  - Measurements included: Automatic Weather Station data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical (point quadrat) composition.
  - Monitoring schedule and measurement methods documented (Table 1 reference in the report).
  - Methods included: mowing of vegetation with a Kubota mower, 0.5 m2 quadrats sampled within sub-plots, and a Point Quadrat survey (grid of 100 cells with 25 pins dropped per cell).
  - Data quality checks: inter-surveyor comparison showed no significant difference between surveyors in 2001 (p = 0.18); data uploaded to appropriate data managers/portals.

- 2. Results

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 headline weather data were generally unremarkable.
    - Rainfall near the long-term average; total rainfall 839 mm (2001) vs 845 mm (1999) and 1209 mm (2000).
    - Radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture content slightly higher in 2001.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear hierarchical biomass response across treatments, with peak biomass in July–August each year.
    - 2001 showed a substantial increase in biomass estimates relative to 1999–2000, attributed to changes in personnel and the switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Normalised against the C1 (control) treatment to assess treatment effects; nitrogen and/or lime additions consistently increased biomass, with the nitrogen+lime treatment most effective.
    - ANOVA (log-transformed biomass) indicated:
      - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots.
      - Significant year × treatment interaction.
      - No significant differences between blocks.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Upper 5 cm soil pH influenced by amendments:
      - Lime additions raised pH to 6.19 in limed plots.
      - Nitrogen plus lime raised pH to 6.38.
      - Nitrogen alone raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
      - Control plots showed no significant change since baseline in 1998.

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Quadrat survey showed 58% more hits than July 2000, indicating increased sward density (likely from reduced grazing since 1998).
    - No significant surveyor effect on results in 2001.
    - Species-level shifts by treatment:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 and was no longer the most abundant in most plots.
      - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide (F. ovina) and N+L (F. rubra) plots.
      - Improved plots ( nitrogen and/or lime) favored Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, and Holcus mollis.
      - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) remained more common in untreated controls.
    - Diversity: unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) had 24 species; improved plots (N and/or L) had 18 species, suggesting potential early declines in diversity with higher fertility/liming.
    - Multivariate analysis: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separated plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots associated with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum; improved plots linked with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, and related species.
    - Biomass relationship: higher biomass correlated with increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines in abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis with increasing biomass.
    - Litter: higher frequency of litter in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

- 3. Site heterogeneity

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site, with columns E and F showing more acidic plots than left-hand columns.
    - Although partly confounded by treatment distribution, there is evidence of underlying spatial heterogeneity, especially lower pH in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots in certain columns.

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass values showed outliers (lower biomass in several plots across treatments) and higher biomass in more central plots (e.g., N+L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass (Fig 9); no significant difference in biomass across blocks (ANOVA).

- Overall implications for monitoring
  - Fertilisation and liming alter soil chemistry (pH) and drive substantial changes in biomass production and species composition.
  - There is clear evidence of spatial heterogeneity influencing outcomes, underscoring the need to account for site geometry and underlying variability in monitoring analyses.
  - Data continuity and cross-year comparability are achievable with standardised methods (e.g., consistent point quadrat protocol, consistent biomass harvesting), but changes in personnel and methodology (e.g., mowing equipment) can affect absolute biomass estimates and should be normalised when comparing years.
  - The observed shifts in plant communities highlight the sensitivity of grassland biosystems to nutrient and lime amendments and have implications for biodiversity monitoring and the interpretation of policy-relevant environmental health indicators.

- Acknowledgments and notes
  - Acknowledges personnel changes and operational constraints (e.g., FMD-related access restrictions in 2001) that impacted site management and sampling cadence.
  - The report documents explicit measurement dates, protocols, and data handling practices to facilitate transparency and reproducibility across monitoring groups.
