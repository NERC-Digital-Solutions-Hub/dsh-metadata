# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The Sourhope field experiment, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, provides broad, cross-year monitoring context to support detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons. Measurements include weather, biomass production, soil chemistry, and botanical composition, with explicit treatment and spatial layout to assess responses to nutrient and lime additions, as well as biocide treatment.

## Monitoring components and methods

- Automatic Weather Station
  - Continuous weather data collection (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture) at Sourhope.
- Above-ground biomass
  - Seasonal biomass measurements across plots (May–Sep 1999–2001) with multiple mowing dates; biomass summed and analysed.
  - Treatments include control, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Biocide.
- Soil pH
  - Soil pH measured in upper 5 cm, baseline in 1998, follow-up in Oct 2001.
- Botanical composition
  - Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001, replicated from 2000 protocol) to determine species relative abundance (hits) across treatments.
  - Data analysed with Genstat, including PCA for community structure.

## Key results

- Weather (2001 context)
  - 2001 rainfall near long-term average (839 mm) after a very wet prior year; radiation stable; slight cooling and higher soil moisture relative to some previous years.
- Above-ground biomass
  - Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass across years; peak production in July/August.
  - 2001 showed a pronounced increase in biomass vs 2000, partly attributed to staff changes and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime additions significantly boosted biomass; Nitrogen+Lime often most effective.
  - ANOVA indicates significant treatment effects on total annual biomass; year-to-year interaction also significant.
- Soil pH
  - Liming raised surface pH: ~6.19 in limed plots; ~6.38 in Nitrogen+Lime plots by Oct 2001.
  - Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed little change since 1998 baseline.
- Botanical composition
  - 2001 point quadrat survey recorded 58% more total hits than 2000, suggesting greater sward density (potentially from grazing removal in 1998).
  - Species shifts consistent with improved fertility: declines in Agrostis capillaris across most treatments; increases in Festuca spp (ovina and rubra) and grasses associated with improved pastures (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra) in fertilized plots (especially N and/or Lime).
  - Higher species richness in unimproved plots (24 species in Control/Biocide vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime), implying potential early signs of diversity reduction with strongest fertility improvement.
  - PCA broadly separates nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots show a more uniform, bryophyte- and Nardus-dominated composition.
  - Biomass–species relationships: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes and Agrostis vinealis decline as biomass increases; litter increases in N and/or Lime plots indicate faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
  
## Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns

- Spatial variation across the site
  - Columns E and F exhibited more acidic conditions and lower pH, partially linked to plot composition (many Controls or Biocide plots in these columns).
  - Central plots generally showed higher biomass, indicating a spatial gradient in productivity.
- Biomass–pH relationship
  - Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, reinforcing the link between liming, soil chemistry, and productive vegetation.

## Management context and data considerations

- Management disruptions in 2001
  - Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions limited site access Feb–May 2001; subsequent sampling followed a targeted protocol and vet oversight.
  - The site officer in charge changed in May 2001, potentially contributing to observed biomass increases (staff changes and equipment shift).
  - First biocide application in May 2001 was missed; remaining biocide applications completed.
- Data handling and analysis
  - Weather data transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager; analyses included split-plot ANOVA for biomass, and PCA for botanical composition.
  - Cross-year comparability aided by consistent measurement protocols and careful normalisation (e.g., biomass relative to C1).

## Implications for monitoring and policy decisions

- Fertility management effects
  - Nitrogen and lime consistently elevate biomass and raise soil pH, with combined N&L often yielding the strongest responses.
  - Changes in plant community composition reflect enhanced fertility, with a shift toward species typical of improved pastures.
- Data quality and governance
  - Monitoring effectiveness depends on stable staffing, consistent measurement methods, and timely data sharing; metadata completeness and data accessibility remain important considerations.
- Spatial heterogeneity
  - Recognize and account for inherent site heterogeneity when interpreting treatment effects; spatial planning may improve monitoring sensitivity.
- Longitudinal value
  - The integrated approach (weather, biomass, soil chemistry, and vegetation surveys) supports cross-year analyses and informs decisions on data collection emphasis for future monitoring efforts.
