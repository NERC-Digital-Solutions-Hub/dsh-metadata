  - General patterns:
    - Surface horizons are strongly organic-rich with low pH (acidic).
    - Nutrient concentrations (N, C, base cations) tend to decrease with depth.
    - LOI percentages indicate high organic matter in surface horizons, decreasing through deeper horizons.
    - Ca, Mg, K, and Na follow depth-related trends, with Ca and Mg generally higher in FH/H horizons than deeper horizons.
  - Data quality notes:
    - Values vary by horizon as expected; some horizon samples show low or absent Na in several horizons.
    - The dataset is a snapshot from a single block; extrapolation to other blocks should be done with caution.

- Auger samples (BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES)
  - Subsamples 4A–4F provide point-specific data on %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2), moisture loss, weight, etc.
  - Example ranges:
    - %N: approximately 0.53–0.58% across several auger samples.
    - %C: typically 6–9% in upper horizons, with lower values deeper.
    - C:N: commonly around 12–14.
    - Ca: 0.35–5.08 meq/100g across horizons; Mg: 0.58–3.5 meq/100g; K: ~0.58–0.81 meq/100g; Na often near 0.
    - %Moisture loss: roughly 4–9%.
    - LOI: wide range, from ~4% up to ~20%.
    - pH(H2O): ~3.64–5.02; pH(CaCl2): ~3.53–4.19.
  - Notes:
    - Data capture across auger samples supports horizon-level comparisons, but individual sample values show variability typical of patchy soils and limited sub-sampling.

- Vegetation survey (BLOCK 4)
  - Plot-level vegetation data recorded as species counts per subplot, with totals per plot (e.g., 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F) including totals for each species and overall species totals per plot.
  - Indicates presence/absence and abundance indicators across plots, enabling community composition analyses and linkage to soil properties.
  - Dominant or indicator species appear in the per-plot lists, enabling community classification alongside soil data.

- ECOTRON soil site data
  - Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT): Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76; Na 0.15; K 0.62; Mg 1.7; %Moisture loss 4.79; LOI 17.42; pH(H2O) 4.79; pH(CaCl2) 3.82.
  - Vegetation survey: records per subplot and plot; indicates community composition and species totals for ECOTRON plot.

- Block 5 context (brief overview)
  - Site details (Block 5): coordinates NT8544019520; altitude 315 m; slope 5°; soil drainage imperfect; major soil subgroup Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material and rock types described.

  - Soil analyses (BLOCK 5 PROFILE and AUGER SAMPLES): results for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2) across horizons and auger samples (5A–5F). Examples show high LOI in surface horizons, strong organic content in Ah, and acidic to very acidic pH values in upper horizons.
  - Vegetation survey (BLOCK 5): plot-level species counts and totals for subplots; rich dataset enabling cross-plot vegetation comparisons and soil-vegetation association studies.

- Ecotron site data (ECOTRON context)
  - Includes dedicated soil chemical/physical measurements and vegetation data for a controlled environment subplot, enabling investigation of soil–microbial–plant relationships within a managed context.

- Data management and outputs
  - Datasets are organized by block, horizon, and sub-sample (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; auger samples 4A–4F; Block 5 horizons and auger samples 5A–5F).
  - Data captured include weights, %N, %C, C:N, base cations (Ca, Na, K, Mg), moisture loss, LOI, pH, and horizon descriptions, along with vegetation species lists and totals.
  - MLURI barcodes and archival identifiers accompany samples, supporting long-term storage and retrieval.
  - Outputs include horizon- and block-level summaries, vegetation tables, and references to analytical workflows (e.g., Twinspan-like outputs and vegetation classifications) for reproducibility.

- Key uses and implications for data support
  - Enables cross-block comparisons of soil chemistry, organic matter content, and acidity, linked to vegetation communities.
  - Supports horizon- and plot-level analyses of soil-plant interactions, biodiversity patterns, and ecological policy implications.
  - Provides a rich, multi-format dataset (soil chemistry, physical properties, vegetation inventories) suitable for dashboarding, self-serve analyses, and reproducible research workflows.

- Data limitations and considerations
  - Patchy sampling and variable sub-plot coverage, especially across blocks and horizons.
  - Some horizons show high variability, and certain Na values are missing in several horizons.
  - Extrapolation beyond sampled plots should be done cautiously; integration across blocks requires careful normalization.

- Practical takeaways for data users
  - Leverage horizon-specific data (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, LOI, pH) to profile soil fertility gradients and acidity with depth.
  - Use auger sample datasets to explore micro-scale heterogeneity within horizons.
  - Combine soil data with vegetation survey results to investigate soil–vegetation associations and indicator species across blocks.
  - Access archived datasets via MLURI barcodes for replication, archival research, or longitudinal analyses.
