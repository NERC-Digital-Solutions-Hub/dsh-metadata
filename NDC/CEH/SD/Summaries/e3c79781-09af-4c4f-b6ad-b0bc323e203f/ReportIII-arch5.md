# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Introduction
  - Large-field experiment at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to provide context for detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons; measurements and dates summarized to aid data linking.
  - 2001 management events: government restrictions during Foot and Mouth Disease reduced site visits Feb–May; change of site Officer in Charge in May 2001.

- Data Collected and Methods
  - Automatic Weather Station data: headline measures including rainfall, radiation, soil moisture, and temperatures; site data downloaded regularly and sent to the CEH Data Manager.
  - Above-ground biomass: seasonal harvests (May–Sept) across plots/subplots; drying and weighing of biomass; data used for yearly and cumulative analyses.
  - Soil pH: upper 5 cm sampled; pH quantified to monitor lime and nitrogen effects.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001 ref. July 2000 protocol) to record species hits; additional relative cover surveys near minirhizotron tubes and in disturbance/nutrient subplots.
  - Experimental schedule and data collection: detailed Table 1 documents dates and activities; mowing (mechanical vs manual changes in 2001) and sampling events across years.
  - Data management: datasets generated for multiple measures and years;Plant species codes and survey methods documented; Appendix 1 provides annual biomass per plot.

- Experimental Design and Treatments
  - Plot-level treatments (five treatments plus controls): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), and Biocide.
  - Field design exhibits spatial heterogeneity (columns E and F showing more acidic conditions); central plots tended to show higher biomass; treatment effects interact with year.

- Key Results

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 rainfall near the long-term average after an unusually wet prior year; radiation similar; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than previous years.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Consistent treatment hierarchy in biomass estimates; peak biomass in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass substantially higher than prior years, attributed in part to personnel changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Nitrogen and/or Lime treatments consistently promoted biomass; ANOVA shows significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots and a significant treatment-by-year interaction; blocks were not significant.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime application raised surface pH: about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in N&L plots by Oct 2001; nitrogen alone also raised pH but less markedly.
    - Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (Aug 1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - 2001 point quadrat survey recorded 58% more hits than 2000; no significant difference between surveyors in 2001.
    - Treatment differences in species abundance: Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased and dominated fertilized plots (F. rubra in N&L; F. ovina in N); species associated with improved pastures (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra) increased with fertilization; species linked to poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
    - Higher species richness in unimproved treatments (24 species) vs. 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting possible diversity reduction with improved management.
    - Principal Components Analysis separated improved plots (N and/or L) from unimproved plots; biomass correlated positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while other species declined with increasing biomass.
    - Increased litter in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime indicated faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

- Site Heterogeneity and Its Implications
  - 3.1 Variation in surface pH and plant community: evidence of spatial heterogeneity across columns, with more acidic conditions in some columns and in N/L plots there.
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass: outlier plots exhibited low biomass; central plots generally higher biomass; strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences between blocks.

- Data Governance, Provenance, and Quality Considerations
  - Routine data management practices documented (weather data managed by CEH; protocol for data collection and species surveys described; appendix with annual biomass data).
  - Changes in data collection methods in 2001 (switch to mechanical cutting) likely affected biomass measurements and comparability with earlier years; significant Year × Treatment interaction confirms inter-annual variation beyond treatment effects.
  - Site heterogeneity (spatial structure) must be considered when pooling across plots; PCA and correlation analyses support treatment-related shifts in community composition and biomass.

- Implications for Data Stewardship
  - The dataset provides rich time-series across multiple variables (biomass, pH, botanical composition, weather) with explicit treatment and spatial design, but requires careful metadata:
    - Document measurement protocols, equipment changes (manual vs mechanical cutting), and any protocol deviations (notably 2001).
    - Capture site layout details (columns, blocks, plots, subplots) and known heterogeneity (e.g., columns E/F) to inform downstream analyses.
    - Link biomass data with pH and species composition to enable cross-variable analyses (as demonstrated by ANOVA, PCA, and correlation results).
  - Ensure data accessibility and discoverability via consistent coding for plots, treatments, and species, with clear definitions (e.g., species codes, treatment abbreviations).
  - Preserve longitudinal context by maintaining baseline measures and noting any management events (e.g., FMD restrictions) that impacted data collection.
  - Provide guidance on handling potential biases introduced by changes in data collection methods when performing cross-year comparisons.

- Appendix and Data Availability
  - Appendix 1: annualized above-ground biomass per plot (2001) with mean values across blocks.
  - Tables and figures embedded in the report (e.g., ANOVA results, PCA plots, species hit counts) support reproducibility and cross-year analyses.

- Summary takeaway
  - Between 1999 and 2001, nutrient amendments (N and/or Lime) and management changes significantly influenced biomass, soil pH, and plant community composition, with notable inter-annual variability and spatial heterogeneity across the Sourhope site. Data stewardship should emphasize thorough metadata, documentation of methodological changes, and attention to site structure when analyzing and sharing the dataset.
