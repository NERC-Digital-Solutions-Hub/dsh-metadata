# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Documents detailed soil and vegetation data for Sourhope, focusing on Block 4 auger samples, Block 5 site details and profiles, and ECOTRON plots.
- Describes sampling design, horizon-level soil chemistry, moisture loss, LOI, and pH measurements, plus vegetation surveys at multiple plots.
- Integrates with ECN/Micronet frameworks to support long-term environmental monitoring and cross-site comparisons.
- Specifies data management and archiving procedures (MLURI server for raw/processed data; soil samples archived at CEH Merlewood at -80°C).

## Data types and sampling design

- Block 4 Auger Samples (Blocks 4A–4F)
  - Measurements per horizon/sample: weight (mg), %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH (H2O), pH (CaCl2).
  - Sample identifiers: MLURI barcodes for 4A–4F; corresponding numeric values provided.
- Block 4 Vegetation Survey
  - Plots and subplots with species presence/absence data; species totals and counts by subplot; multi-plot structure (A–F) within plots.
- Block 5 Site Details and Soil Profile
  - Site metadata: grid reference NT8544019520, altitude 315 m, slope 5°, imperfect drainage, major soil subgroup Brown forest soil with gleying.
  - Soil profile Descriptions (Depth cm, horizon labels FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with horizon-specific descriptions.
- Block 5 Soil Analysis and Auger Samples
  - Auger sample analyses (A–F) include: weight (mg), %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Auger samples labeled 5A–5F with corresponding MLURI barcodes; detailed per-sample chemistry and pH values.
- Block 5 Vegetation Survey
  - Plot-level vegetation data (5A–5F) including species totals and per-subplot species counts; presence/absence indicators and totals across plots.
- ECOTRON PLOT
  - Soil analysis (weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2)).
  - Vegetation survey with plot-level species counts and totals.
- ECN/Micronet context
  - ECN soil site data and Micronet-related analyses for grassland ecosystems, highlighting Sourhope as a main monitoring site.

## Key measurements and variables

- Soil chemistry and physics
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio; Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g).
  - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI); pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2).
- Soil physical descriptions
  - Horizon-specific descriptions (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.) with texture and structure notes.
  - Depth intervals for profiles (e.g., FH 0–5 cm, H 5–7 cm, Ah 7–25 cm, AB 25–35 cm, Bg 35–49 cm, BCg 49–70 cm, Cg 70–100 cm in Block 5).
- Vegetation
  - Plot and subplot-level species presence/absence; totals per plot; indicator species and community assignments (in broader context of site analyses).
- Data IDs and archiving
  - MLURI barcodes for each sample; Horizon IDs and horizon-specific data; archived copies and reference data files (e.g., Analysis of Auger Samples files).

## Data organization and accessibility

- Raw and processed data stored on the MLURI server; soil samples archived at CEH Merlewood at -80°C.
- Detailed data files and supporting documentation referenced (e.g., horizon-specific tables, data appendix structures).
- Emphasis on standardized data formats to facilitate reuse, cross-plot comparisons, and integration with ECN/Micronet datasets.

## Implications for environmental monitoring

- Provides high-resolution, horizon-level soil chemistry and vegetation data across multiple blocks and plots, enabling assessment of site management practices and climate-related responses.
- The combination of auger samples, soil profiles, and ecotronic/ECN-linked plots supports robust long-term monitoring and cross-site policy-relevant analyses.
- Data standardization and accessibility initiatives support reuse beyond single studies, supporting broader environmental health indicators over time.

## Takeaways for analysts monitoring the environment

- Sourhope offers a rigorous, long-term dataset with standardized protocols for soil and vegetation measurements across multiple blocks, aligned with national and international monitoring networks.
- The detailed horizon-level chemistry (NO3/NOx patterns not shown here but implied by LOI, pH, Ca/Mg/Na/K trends) enables exploration of soil processes, nutrient cycling, and disturbance responses under different treatments and climate variability.
- Key opportunities include integrating Block 4/Block 5 data with other environmental datasets (climate, soil chemistry, biodiversity) and ensuring ongoing data accessibility and interoperability through centralized portals.
