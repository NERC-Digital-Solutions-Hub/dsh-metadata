SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- Purpose within the Sourhope monitoring framework
  - Part of the long-term soil profiling and vegetation monitoring at a replicated field site to inform environmental health indicators and management outcomes.

- Horizon-level description (Block 4)
  - LF (0–1 cm): Fibrous, moist; no mineral grains; smooth boundary.
  - FH (1–4 cm): Semi-fibrous; moist; very fine roots; smooth boundary.
  - H (4–8 cm): Black, amorphous material; weak blocky structure; fine fibrous roots; sharp boundary.
  - Ah (8–29 cm): Very dark brown, sandy silt loam; weak to moderate blocky structure; friable; abundant roots; some igneous stones; sharp boundary.
  - Abg (29–40 cm): Pinkish grey with mottles; coarse sandy silt loam; diffuse mottles; moderate angular blocky structure; abundant small igneous stones.
  - B sg (40–61 cm): Brown; mottled; sandy silt loam; moderate blocky structure; roots present; many small igneous stones.
  - C gx (61–95 cm): Reddish brown; sandy clay loam; massive to platy structure; few roots; abundant igneous stones.

- Soil chemistry and physical properties (Block 4)
  - Volumetric data show horizon-specific nutrient patterns (example values):
    - %N and %C vary by horizon; C:N ratios typically around 12–20 across horizons.
    - Ca dominates top horizons (e.g., ~10 meq/100 g in FH/H), decreasing with depth; Na generally low; Mg moderate; K low to moderate.
    - pH (H2O) generally acidic to near-acidic (roughly 4.7–5.0 in upper horizons); CaCl2 pH values also indicative of acidity.
    - %Moisture loss and Loss on Ignition (LOI) indicate substantial organic matter in Ah horizons (higher LOI) and decreasing with depth.
  - Depth-wide patterns reflect an acidic, organic-rich upper profile transitioning to more mineral, mottled subsoil with igneous stone content.

- Auger samples (Block 4)
  - Auger cores across subplots show consistent variability in %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Mg, and moisture/LOI consistent with horizon data.
  - Notable horizon-to-horizon variation in exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K) and C:N relationships across depths.

- Vegetation survey (Block 4)
  - Species pool includes common grasses and forbs such as Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Poa pratensis, Trifolium repens, and others.
  - Community classification largely aligns with NVC grassland types:
    - Predominantly U4d (Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile) with Luzula multiflora-Rhytidiadelphus loreus subcommunity in many plots.
    - Some moister/damp micro-sites align with U5b (Nardus stricta-Galium saxatile) subcommunities.
  - Spatial patterns revealed by analysis (Twinspan/associations) show indicator species and distinct groupings across blocks, with interior vs edge contexts discernible.

- Data handling, governance, and outputs (Block 4)
  - Data are archived with horizon-specific measurements, block means, and site-wide summaries.
  - Datasets referenced include vegetation inventories, soil chemistry, LOI/moisture, and profile descriptions; preparation for metadata and open-data sharing considerations.
  - Outputs support long-term monitoring, cross-site comparisons, and integration with ECN/Micronet initiatives for policy-relevant biodiversity and soil health indicators.

- Ecotron plot (Block 4)
  - A dedicated controlled-environment subplot within the experimental design.
  - Provides complementary data on soil properties under managed conditions and supports mechanistic investigations alongside field plots.

- ECOTRON context (Block 4)
  - Part of the ECN framework with soil analyses, vegetation surveys, and site context data to link field measurements to network-scale environmental change signals.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a replicated, multi-treatment field design with detailed horizon profiling, comprehensive soil chemistry, and annual vegetation surveys.
  - Supports development of soil- and vegetation-based health indicators, metadata standards, and governance for data sharing and reuse.

- Appendix and data notes
  - Horizon-level data, plot-level summaries, and references to supplementary analyses (e.g., Twinspan, association analyses) accompany the Block 4 data.

- ECOTRON PLOT summary (Block 4)
  - Soil analysis (MW: N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; moisture loss; LOI; pH) and vegetation inventories documented for the ECOTRON plot, providing a controlled-comparison dataset within the broader Sourhope framework.

BLOCK 5

- Site details (Block 5)
  - Grid reference NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; imperfect drainage.
  - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
  - Soils developed within Sourhope series, aligning with hill/ridge landscape contexts.

- Soil profile (Block 5)
  - LF (0–1 cm): Fibrous, moist; no mineral grains; smooth boundary.
  - FH (1–5 cm): Semi-fibrous; moist; abundant very fine roots; smooth boundary.
  - H (5–7 cm): Black, organic-rich; semi-fibrous; weak blocky structure.
  - Ah (7–25 cm): Very dark brown; sandy silt loam; friable; abundant roots; many medium igneous stones.
  - AB (25–35 cm): Grey; coarse sandy silt loam; friable; abundant roots; many igneous stones.
  - Bg (35–49 cm): Reddish brown; yellow-red mottles; clay loam; abundant mottling; firm; root presence decreases with depth.
  - BCg (49–70 cm): Reddish brown with red/yellow mottles; clay loam; massive to weak blocky structure; roots sparse.
  - Cg (70–100 cm): Light reddish-brown; clay loam; massive structure; many igneous stones; no roots.

- Soil chemistry (Block 5)
  - Depth-distinct patterns similar to Block 4, with horizon-specific N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na values.
  - pH values indicate acidity trends consistent with oxidation and mineralogy; LOI and moisture loss indicate organic-rich Ah horizon diminishing with depth.
  - Ca generally elevated in upper horizons and tapering with depth; Na typically low; Mg and K vary by horizon; cation exchange and base status reflect the gleying and clay content.

- Auger samples (Block 5)
  - Auger cores across 5A–5F show horizon-specific differences in %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, and pH.
  - Some horizons exhibit higher Ca in upper layers with decreases deeper down; Mg and K show more variability by sub-horizon.

- Vegetation survey (Block 5)
  - Plots 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F show species counts and totals at subplots.
  - Species compositions reflect upland grassland communities with notable species totals and indicator taxa; some plots show higher species richness and others more concentrated dominance by a subset of taxa.
  - While detailed species-by-plot figures are extensive, overall pattern aligns with upland grassland assemblages and soil-horizon influence on vegetation structure.

- Data handling and governance (Block 5)
  - Block 5 data follow the same archival approach as Block 4, with horizon- and plot-level data, sub-sample materials, and accompanying metadata considerations to enable sharing and re-use.

- ECOTRON context (Block 5)
  - No explicit ECOTRON plotting described for Block 5 in this excerpt; Block 5 data contribute to the broader Sourhope monitoring framework and its cross-site comparability.

Key takeaways for Monitoring Frameworks (from Blocks 4–5)
- Robust, replicated block design supports assessment of management treatments (e.g., liming, nitrogen additions) on soil health and vegetation dynamics.
- Detailed horizon-level soil profiles combined with chemical analyses (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na), LOI, moisture loss, and pH provide a multi-dimensional set of environmental health indicators.
- Vegetation surveys linked to soil profiles enable interpretation of biodiversity responses to soil conditions and moisture regimes.
- Data archiving at horizon, plot, and block levels, with sub-samples preserved at -80°C, supports long-term data integrity, reproducibility, and open-data sharing, subject to metadata quality and governance standards.
- Integration with ECN/Micronet frameworks enhances policy-relevant interpretation by connecting field data to larger-scale environmental change signals.
