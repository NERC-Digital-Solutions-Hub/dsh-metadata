# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- A comprehensive field study under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) focusing on long-term monitoring to contextualize detailed analyses by various research groups.
- The report presents results across 1999–2001, with emphasis on weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, plus site heterogeneity.

## Data types and datasets
- Automatic Weather Station data (1999–2001): rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture.
- Above-ground biomass measurements: seasonal harvests (May–Sept) across plots; normalization against the Control 1 (C1) to enable cross-year comparison.
- Soil chemical data: surface soil pH (0–5 cm), influenced by lime and nitrogen treatments.
- Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001; mirrored 2000 protocol) to assess species abundance and community shifts.
- Supporting metadata: site management events (e.g., FMD restrictions in 2001), changes in site officer, and data collection schedules.

## Experimental design and data collection context
- Experimental setup includes plots with treatments: Control 1 (C1), Control 2 (C2), Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen + Lime (N&L), and Biocide (B).
- Data collection windows and methods:
  - Above-ground biomass: multiple mowing events per summer; clippings dried and weighed.
  - Botanical surveys: Point Quadrat method on 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots; surveyors validated for consistency (no significant inter-surveyor difference).
  - Soil pH: measurements in upper 5 cm (August 1998 baseline; October 2001 follow-up).
- 2001 changes: shift to mechanical cutting (likely boosting biomass measurements); government restrictions during FMD limited site access (Feb–May 2001) but core management activities proceeded per 2001 Site Management Plan.
- Data handling: biomass data were log-transformed for ANOVAs; results include both within-year and inter-year analyses (Tables 4–5; Fig. 1–6).

## Management events and data implications (2001)
- Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions affected site visitation and sampling windows between February and May 2001.
- Change of site Officer in May 2001; nonetheless management activities (liming, N, pH measurements, biomass collection, mowing, and Point Analysis) largely continued according to plan.
- A biocide application in May 2001 was missed, but subsequent applications occurred as scheduled.

## Key results by data type

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 headline weather data were broadly typical; rainfall near long-term average after a very wet previous year.
  - Radiation stable; slight temperature decrease; soil moisture modestly higher than in prior year.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Clear hierarchy among treatments in biomass production; peak biomass typically in July/August.
  - 2001 biomass estimates substantially higher than 1999–2000, likely due to personnel changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass increases were most pronounced in nitrogen- and lime-amended plots; analyses show significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots, and significant year-by-treatment interactions.
  - Biomass data normalized to C1 to assess consistent treatment effects over time (Fig. 2).

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Lime addition continued to raise soil pH; October 2001 mean pH: 6.19 in limed plots, 6.38 in N&L plots.
  - Nitrogen addition alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed little change since the 1998 baseline.

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - July 2001 survey mirrored July 2000 protocol; two surveyors produced comparable results.
  - 2001 saw 58% more hits than 2000, suggesting a denser sward, possibly due to removal of grazing stock in 1998.
  - Treatment-specific shifts in dominant species:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments (except remaining most abundant in Control 1 and Limed plots).
    - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments, particularly in fertilized plots.
    - Species tied to improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more common in fertilized plots, especially N+L.
    - Species associated with poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more apparent in Control plots.
  - Diversity trends: unimproved plots show more species (24) than the Nitrogen + Lime plots (18), suggesting potential diversity decline with strong improvement.
  - Multivariate analyses (PCA) indicate clear separation between nitrogen/limed plots and controls/biocide plots; improved plots show more extreme shifts toward Festuca rubra and associated species.
  - Correlations between species frequencies and biomass indicate Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance increases with biomass, while Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline as biomass rises.
  - Increased litter frequency in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots aligns with faster vegetation turnover in more fertile soils.

## Site heterogeneity and its implications
- Spatial heterogeneity observed across columns and plots:
  - Columns E and F showed more acidic conditions, with Nitrogen and/or Lime plots tending to lower pH in these columns.
- Biomass distribution showed geographic pattern:
  - Higher biomass generally in more central plots (e.g., N&L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, reinforcing the link between liming, soil chemistry, and productivity.

## Data governance, quality, and accessibility
- Data collection and management:
  - Core data collected by the Macaulay Institute; weather data transmitted to CEH Merlewood Data Manager.
  - Documentation and datasets are coordinated with multiple project streams; standard protocols (e.g., Point Quadrat) ensure comparability.
- Quality checks:
  - Inter-surveyor consistency tested; no significant differences in 2001 survey results.
  - Data analyses employ appropriate transformations and statistical tests (ANOVA, PCA) to assess treatment effects and year-to-year changes.
- Metadata and transparency:
  - Table 1 outlines data collection dates and the breadth of measurements; appendices include annual biomass data and full ANOVA results.
  - Species codes and site-specific methodology are clearly documented to support reuse.

## Implications for data strategy
- Longitudinal, multi-parameter data enable cross-year and cross-treatment comparisons; standardization (protocols, measurement timing, and data transformations) is crucial for comparability.
- Documentation of site management events and external disruptions (e.g., FMD) is essential for interpreting anomalies and data gaps.
- Metadata richness (treatment definitions, species codes, plot coordinates, sampling schemes) supports interoperability across projects and enhances data discoverability.
- The approach demonstrates the value of integrating weather, soil, biomass, and botanical data to understand system-level responses to management interventions.
