# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context
  - Intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Baseline and monitoring designed to link with other research groups; data collection spans 1999–2001 with multiple measurement types.
  - 2001 management events: Foot and Mouth restrictions reduced site access Feb–May 2001; subsequent protocol-managed sampling; change of site officer in May 2001.

## 2. RESULTS

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data largely unremarkable.
- Rainfall near the long-term annual average; radiation similar to prior years.
- Average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture content modestly higher than in previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Treatment hierarchy: biomass estimates consistently follow a treatment-based order; peak biomass occurred in July–August each year.
- 2001 biomass higher than 1999–2000, likely due to a combination of changes in personnel and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- When normalised to the C1 treatment, nitrogen and lime show the strongest positive impact on productivity; nitrogen+lime often most effective.
- Anova on ln-transformed biomass data shows:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continues to raise topsoil pH (0–5 cm):
  - Limed plots: pH around 6.19 in Oct 2001.
  - Nitrogen + Lime (N&L) plots: pH around 6.38.
  - Nitrogen alone also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots show little change since Aug 1998 baseline.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis mirrored 2000 protocol; surveyors’ results not significantly different.
- Total hits in 2001 increased by about 58% vs 2000, suggesting denser sward, possibly from prior grazing removal.
- Species shifts by treatment (2001 vs 2000):
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments, remaining most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide (F. ovina) and N&L (F. rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots (fertilised and/or limed) show more Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis.
- Diversity changes:
  - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential diversity decline with improvement.
- Multivariate pattern:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separates nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Unimproved plots tend to associate with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Improved plots often align with Festuca rubra and related species (Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis).
- Biomass–vegetation relationship:
  - Higher biomass plots show increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Decline in abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis as biomass increases.
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime plots show increased litter, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## 3 SITE HETEROGENEITY

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity: Columns E and F (down-slope/right side) appear more acidic; this is partly influenced by plot composition (more Controls or Biocide plots in those columns) but indicates underlying site-to-site pH variation.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass varies across plots; outliers with the lowest biomass are documented (several Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Biocide plots).
- Centrally located plots tend to have higher cumulative biomass (e.g., N&L in 2E; Lime in 2C; Biocide in 2D; Control 1 in 2B).
- Strong positive correlation observed between surface soil pH and biomass, though no significant block effect detected (Statistical indication: non-significant block differences).
