# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, the Sourhope site in the Scottish Borders has been continuously monitored to track above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) in relation to five plot-level treatments (Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime) and an Insecticide treatment, with mowing, liming, and fertilization applied on a regular schedule since 1999.
- The programme integrates multiple data streams across biological, chemical, and physical variables, linking below-ground biodiversity with above-ground plant communities and ecosystem processes.

- Data assets and types
  - Above-ground biomass: annual totals per plot, with five summer cut harvests (1999–2002) and per-plot/within-block summaries (Appendix 6; Figure 2).
  - Plant community data: point analysis surveys (1998 baseline; 2000–2002 surveys), species lists, bryophyte inventories (Appendix 3; Appendix 8).
  - Functional grouping data: CSR and related functional-group composition (stress tolerators, competitive-stress-ruderals) tracked over time (Figure 9; Table 2).
  - Environmental data: on-site Automatic Weather Station records (rainfall, temperature, radiation; Appendix 5).
  - Soil chemistry and moisture: soil pH at 5 cm depth; soil moisture measurements; multiple soil samples since 1998 (Section 2.2; Figure 3; Figure 4).
  - Site management metadata: site-level mowing routine; plot-level treatments; dates and rates for nitrogen, lime, and insecticide applications (Section 2.1; Appendix 2).

- Data collection and management framework
  - Experimental design: Rigg Foot Site with 5 replicate blocks, 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; data collection cells of 0.5 m x 0.5 m allocated to research groups (Section 2.1; Appendix 1).
  - Regular data collection: monthly mowing, pre-cut biomass sampling, soil pH and moisture checks, weather data, and annual/seasonal plant surveys (Section 2.2; 3.1–3.4).
  - Longitudinal data scope: baseline in 1998; ongoing measurements through 2002 with data from 1999–2002 used to assess treatment effects and temporal trends (Introduction; Results).
  - Data documentation and availability: extensive appendices (Appendices 1–8) detailing site treatments, species lists, biomass records, weather, and analysis outputs; reference to a Soil Biodiversity website for broader project details (Introduction; 2.2; Appendix 5).

- Key findings relevant to data interpretation
  - Mowing and disturbance regime
    - Regular mowing and removal of grazing led to an increase in stress-tolerant species across most plots; bryophytes expanded under the maintained sward height (~6 cm) and absence of grazing.
    - Agrostis spp. (capillaris/vinealis) declined by over 40% since 2000, affecting community structure across treatments.
  - Fertilisation effects
    - Nitrogen and/or lime fertilisation consistently increased above-ground productivity, with the largest gains in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime. Productivity in fertilised plots may be peaking in some cases due to high soil pH and potential moisture stress.
    - Soil pH rose significantly in limed plots (approaching pH 7.0), while nitrogen alone had smaller positive effects on pH.
    - Higher pH coupled with higher fertility favored competitive (C) and CS-R-type species, whereas stress-tolerant (S) species benefited in unfertilised plots.
  - Insecticide effects
    - Insecticide treatment (Dursban) is associated with higher plant diversity (Shannon index) in some analyses, but the causal link to reduced herbivory remains unclear; potential for increased establishment of palatable species under relatively infertile conditions.
  - Trampling and 13CO2 experiments
    - The C2 plots, subjected to intense activity for 13CO2 pulses, showed notable reductions in productivity, highlighting trampling as a confounding factor in short windows of intensive activity.
  - Biodiversity and functional groups
    - Across 2000–2002, SR/C-S-R and S functional groups accounted for a large share of species hits; nitrogen+lime plots favored C-S-R species, while unimproved plots favored stress-tolerant species.
    - Bryophyte representation increased over time, particularly in unimproved plots, contributing to shifts in overall diversity and biomass composition.
  - Temporal and spatial patterns
    - Biomass increases from 1999–2001 were sometimes followed by declines in 2002, with pronounced spatial variation along the slope (Block 1–Block 5) and among treatments.
    - Spatially, slope position influenced productivity, with lower slope areas sometimes showing greater relative increases than higher slope areas in certain years.

- Data quality, gaps, and limitations
  - 2002 weather data includes missing periods due to a station malfunction; some data were supplemented from a nearby station (Konza) to maintain continuity.
  - Field activities in 2002 included new data collection on blocks that had not been sampled previously (Control 2), introducing potential comparability considerations.
  - Trampling and labelling activities (e.g., 13CO2 pulses) introduced local distortions in productivity measurements for certain plots.
  - Taxonomic resolution improved in 2002 for bryophytes, expanding species-level identifications compared with earlier years.

- Implications for data stewardship
  - The project generates a rich, multi-dimensional longitudinal dataset requiring robust metadata, clear treatment and plot linkage, and careful versioning to ensure cross-year comparability.
  - Data are organized with extensive appendices and a dedicated project website, but continued emphasis on standardized taxonomy, measurement protocols, and data dictionaries will aid interoperability with other Soil Biodiversity datasets and external studies.
  - Documentation around missing data, data gaps, and corrections (e.g., weather station outages and data substitutions) is essential for transparent reuse and meta-analyses.
  - Long-term archiving and accessibility strategies should preserve the linkage between environmental variables, management treatments, species-level records, and biomass metrics to support cross-study synthesis and replication.

- Practical takeaways for Data Stewards
  - Ensure comprehensive metadata for all datasets (treatment codes, plot allocations, sampling dates, measurement units, species names, and taxonomic updates).
  - Maintain data dictionaries mapping Appendix 2 treatment details to the main biomass and biodiversity datasets.
  - Archive all appendices (Appendices 1–8) as discrete, citable data objects with clear DOIs or identifiers.
  - Plan for handling and documenting data gaps due to equipment failures, including provenance of substitute data sources.
  - Facilitate access to the Soil Biodiversity website and associated data portals to enable discoverability and reuse by researchers and data users with diverse needs.
