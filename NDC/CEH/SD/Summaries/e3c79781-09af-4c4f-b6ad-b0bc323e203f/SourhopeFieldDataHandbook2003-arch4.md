# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Documentation of the Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Programme at Sourhope Experimental Farm, focusing on the Rigg Foot site to study soil biodiversity, vegetation, and related ecological processes.
- Long-term objective to understand relationships between soil microbial and plant communities; integration with external networks (ECN and SERAD Micronet) for cross-site comparisons and long-term environmental assessment.
- Institutional context: data stored within MLURI systems and archived for long-term use; laboratories, computing resources, and visiting researchers supported on site.

## Data assets and structure
- Vegetation data
  - Ground surveys using 50 x 50 cm quadrats within randomly selected subplots per main plot; presence/absence and, where possible, abundance; extensive species lists and frequency data.
  - Dominant grasses include Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta; species richness tends to increase downslope.
  - Analytical frameworks include Twinspan, National Vegetation Classification (NVC) comparisons, and association analyses to identify communities and indicator species.
- Soil data
  - Sampling design includes multiple horizons (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) across depths 0–100 cm, with W-pattern cores and pit profiling.
  - Analyses cover %N, %C, C:N, extractable cations (Ca, Na, K, Mg), %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2) across horizons; environmental context includes soil acidity and horizon-specific variability.
  - Auger samples (Block 4/5) with detailed chemical, physical, and pH measurements for multiple sub-samples.
- Data management and storage
  - Raw and processed vegetation and soil data maintained by MLURI; some data archived at CEH Merlewood; Appendix A provides block-level soil and vegetation data; barcodes link samples to analyses.
- Experimental treatments and design
  - Site layout comprises five blocks (1–5), each with multiple main plots (A–F) subdivided into subplots; experimental treatments include Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Lime + Nitrogen, Biocide, and (historical) Fallow (later omitted).
  - Management practices include regular cutting to simulate grazing, with fencing to restrict access; past grazing (sheep) largely halted in 1997–1998 to establish the experiment.
- Data processing and analyses
  - Vegetation data analyzed with Twinspan, NVC matching, and association analyses to identify communities and indicator species.
  - Soil data analyzed with standard correlations and multivariate analyses; horizon- and block-level comparisons to assess chemical and physical properties.

## Data quality, gaps, and scope
- Establishment-year sampling limited: only about one-third of subplots per main plot sampled; results serve as a guide rather than a complete census.
- Block-level anomalies observed in soil data (notably Blocks 4 and 5, with Block 3 showing more variability); interpretation should consider these anomalies.
- Temporal variability anticipated due to seasonal changes and changes in management (reduced grazing post-1997–1998).
- Cross-block patterns show consistent core vegetation and soil characteristics, but local variability (edge plots, damper microhabitats) exists.

## Metadata, standards, and governance
- Horizon nomenclature and plot/block identifiers are precise (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and require machine-readable metadata for reproducibility.
- Data categories span vegetation, soil chemistry, soil physics, horizon descriptions, and management metadata; integration relies on consistent units and naming conventions.
- Cross-network collaboration (ECN, SERAD Micronet) highlights the need for standardized metadata, reporting formats, and data sharing protocols with external partners.

## Cross-network relevance
- Sourhope participates in the UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) and SERAD Micronet, enabling cross-site comparisons and long-term environmental monitoring.

## Practical implications for Data Leaders
- Data integration and governance
  - Implement a centralized data schema that captures vegetation, soil, horizon, and management metadata; ensure consistent units and variable naming.
  - Develop a robust data catalog linking Appendix A, soil profiles, vegetation datasets, and processing scripts (Twinspan, NVC classifications, Association analyses) to support reproducibility.
- Metadata and standards
  - Maintain machine-readable metadata for horizon designations, plot/block IDs, treatment codes, sampling times, and analytical methods.
- Data quality and continuity
  - Address sampling gaps by formalizing uniform coverage strategies for ongoing and future sampling; document block-level anomalies and their impact on analyses.
  - Establish data quality checks and documentation of data transformations or imputations for missing subplot data.
- Data preservation and sharing
  - Plan long-term preservation of raw soil cores, horizon descriptions, and survey data; ensure provenance and data lineage are clear.
  - Leverage ECN and Micronet frameworks for data standardization, interoperability, and controlled external data sharing; implement versioning and access controls.
- Governance recommendations
  - Create a centralized data schema and a data catalog; enforce metadata standards; link analysis scripts and results to raw data with clear provenance.
  - Develop cross-network data exchange protocols and align ontologies with ECN/SERAD requirements; ensure appropriate data access permissions and documentation.
