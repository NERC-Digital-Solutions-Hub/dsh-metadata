# Plant biomass, soil conditions and stable isotope concentrations in soil, roots and shoots from a microcosm experiment [NERC Soil Biodiversity Programme]

## Context and aims
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (established 1999) focused on understanding soil biodiversity and the functional roles of soil organisms in key ecological processes.
- Site: Sourhope, Scottish Borders; large field experiment with 24 projects examining soil structure, carbon and nitrogen cycles, and soil fauna (micro-, meso-, and macro-fauna).
- Primary objective: link soil biotic diversity and function to plant-microbial competition and nutrient cycling, notably organic nitrogen pathways.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Microcosms built from Sourhope soil in pots; defaunated and re-inoculated with microbial communities.
- Plant system: Agrostis capillaris established in each microcosm.
- Faunal treatments: eight monoculture species plus multi-species communities (two, four, and eight species) including two oribatid mites and multiple collembolans; a predatory mite included in higher-diversity treatments.
- Biomass and soil moisture carefully controlled; pots replicated 10 times and arranged in a randomized block in a glasshouse.
- Isotopic labeling: pulse of glycine labeled with 13C and 15N (glycine-213C-15N) applied to trace uptake into plant tissue and microbial biomass; final enrichment ~5 at% 15N; total N added per pot ~5 μg N g^-1 soil.
- Growth period: 4 months before destructive harvesting.

## Data collection and measurements
- Plant measurements: shoot biomass (multiple harvests), root biomass, and percent root length colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi.
- Microbial and soil measurements: microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN); soil extractable ammonia, nitrate, and phosphate; total soil carbon and nitrogen; isotopic ratios (15N/14N and 13C/12C) in roots and shoots; total organic carbon in extracts.
- AM and microbial analyses: root staining for mycorrhizal colonization; isotopic analyses via isotope ratio mass spectrometry; standard QA references and lab calibrations.
- Data sources and labs: measurements performed at Soil Ecology Laboratory (Lancaster University) and Stable Isotope Facility (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Merlewood); ancillary analyses tied to SOLID references and established protocols.

## Data structure and accessibility
- Dataset: 1049 – Microcosm nitrogen pulse P2133_MICROCOSM_N_PULSE.csv
- Key structure: pot number, glycine labeling status, water treatment, block, species presence (collembolans and mites), mycorrhizal abundance/root length colonization, shoot and root biomasses, microbial biomass metrics, and a suite of stable isotope measurements.
- Variables include specific presence/absence indicators for each fauna, biomass measurements, isotopic ratios, and lab provenance (with explicit units and analysis labs).
- Quality notes: data described with metadata on each variable, data provenance, and associated measurement protocols.

## Quality control and governance
- Quality assurance steps implemented: numeric range checks, formatting conformity, and logical integrity checks.
- Disclaimer: data are provided with QA but no warranty of accuracy; NERC not liable for fitness of use or outcomes from applying the data.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates integrating biodiversity manipulation with functional nutrient cycling measurements to inform policy-relevant indicators of soil health.
- Illustrates the value of tracer-based approaches (stable isotopes) to disentangle plant versus microbial nutrient uptake, a key insight for evaluating policy impacts on nutrient cycling.
- Highlights the complexity of metadata requirements and cross-lab data integration essential for robust environmental monitoring.
- Underlines governance needs: data provenance, transparent sharing of underlying data, and clear data quality standards to support surveillance and decision-making.

## Considerations for policy-focused monitoring
- Data availability and completeness: comprehensive, richly annotated datasets enable better evaluation of interventions but require robust metadata and open access.
- Data integration: multi-component datasets (biota, soil chemistry, isotopes) demand standardized formats and clear provenance to be usable in monitoring dashboards and policy analysis.
- Barriers to data sharing: public data sharing can be a hurdle; fostering open, well-documented datasets with governance can mitigate silos.
- Practical interpretation: while microcosm studies offer mechanistic insight, translating to field-scale policy indicators requires careful extrapolation and context consideration.
