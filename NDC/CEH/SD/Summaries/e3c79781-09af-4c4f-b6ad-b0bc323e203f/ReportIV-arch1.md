# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, monitoring above-ground productivity, plant composition, and diversity.
- Three management processes drive botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and soil insecticide application (Dursban 4).
- The project combines extensive data collection (biomass, point analyses, soil chemistry, weather) with multiple research groups to understand how above- and below-ground components interact.

## Key aims and context
- Assess how management practices alter plant productivity and community function, including the shift in functional types (CSR framework: Competitve C, Stress-tolerant S, Ruderal R).
- Explore relationships among soil pH, moisture, and productivity, and how treatments influence these links.
- Track changes in species diversity (Shannon index), bryophyte abundance, and the balance between improved vs unimproved pasture assemblages.

## Site management and treatments
- Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks, each with 6 main plots subdivided into sub-plots; treatments allocated randomly.
- Management tasks (since 1999):
  - Mowing: monthly May–Sept to ~6 cm across the whole site; cut frequency and timing vary by year.
  - Insecticide: Dursban 4 OPA applied after mowing on insecticide plots.
  - Fertilisation: Nitrogen and/or lime added in spring to designated plots (two-dose nitrogen schedule; lime applied as CaCO3).
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen + Lime (N&L), Insecticide (formerly Biocide).

## Data collection and analyses
- Weather: On-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999.
- Productivity: Above-ground biomass from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots, harvested each mowing, dried, and weighed (since 1999).
- Botanical surveys: Baseline in 1998; 2000, 2001, 2002 point analysis surveys using 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid; bryophytes identified to species level in 2002; regular vegetation cover and biomass sampling.
- Soil measurements: Soil pH (approx. every 5 cm), soil moisture (theta probe in 2002), and periodic sampling for other soil properties.
- Data handling: ANOVA (split-plot), PCA for species-hits data, tracking treatment-year interactions, and biomass normalization against controls.

## Main results by theme

- Biomass and productivity
  - A clear treatment hierarchy in biomass remained: nitrogen- and lime-amended plots most productive, with the strongest effect when combined (N&L).
  - In 2002, biomass declined across many treatments relative to 2001; decreases ranged from 13.7% (N&L) to 31.2% (Control 2).
  - A slope-related effect: productivity tended to be lower higher up the slope (Block 5 lowest, Block 1 highest decline).
  - Overall long-term trend shows rising productivity since 1999, despite the 2002 dip.

- Soil chemistry and productivity links
  - Lime dramatically increased soil pH toward ~7.0 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen had a smaller positive effect.
  - Strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (r ≈ -0.68).
  - Positive relationship between higher pH and biomass across all plots, but within certain treatments (especially N or Lime alone) the correlation weakened; with both N and Lime (N&L), the relationship could become negative or weaker, suggesting moisture limitation or other constraints.
  - High lime (pH near 7) plus high nutrient availability can stress plants via reduced moisture, chlorosis observed in lime-treated plots.

- Plant community composition and functional types
  - Mowing: Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across most treatments; Festuca rubra expanded, particularly in fertile plots (lime and/or nitrogen). Festuca ovina declined; Festuca rubra increased, possibly due to identification issues between rubra and ovina.
  - Fertilisation effects: consistent long-term boost to productivity with N and/or lime; however, the combination (N&L) yielded the strongest growth, while some signs suggested potential nutrient or moisture stress at high pH.
  - Insecticide effects: biomass patterns suggest potential links between reduced herbivory and higher diversity, aligning with historical work, but evidence remains circumstantial; diversity could rise when herbivory is reduced, but direct causality is not established.
  - Trampling: the introduction of C2 plots and intensive activity (e.g., labelled 13CO2 pulses) likely caused localized trampling, contributing to reduced productivity on those plots in 2002.
  - Point Analysis and bryophytes: bryophyte hits increased across the site (19.92% in 2002 vs 10.82% in 2001; 6.48% in 2000). Bryophyte abundance was higher in unimproved plots, contributing to the overall decrease in vascular plant hits in some treatments.
  - Diversity trends: Shannon diversity indices show treatment differences emerged from 2000 onward, with clear differences by 2002; most treatments saw increases relative to baseline, but the N&L treatment showed a decline (about 15%) in 2002 relative to other treatments.
  - Functional groups (CSR framework): three main functional groups accounted for 69–95% of vascular plant hits per plot. By 2002:
    - Stress-tolerators (S) expanded in unimproved plots.
    - C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species dominated plots with N and/or Lime, especially in N&L plots.
    - SR/C-S-R groups were reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
  - PCA of point analysis data separated improved vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots clustered together; some N-treated samples overlapped with lime plots, indicating similar vegetation characteristics under certain conditions.

## Notable species dynamics
- Vascular plants:
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined markedly; Festuca rubra increased; Festuca ovina declined (with some confusion distinguishing F. rubra vs F. ovina).
  - Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra associated with more fertile conditions (dominant hits in fertilised plots).
- Bryophytes:
  - Bryophyte proportion grew notably, especially in unimproved plots; increased moss presence corresponds with higher sward height maintenance and reduced vascular plant dominance in some plots.
- Species richness and hits:
  - The ratio of monocot to dicot hits shifted with treatments; bryophytes gained a larger share in 2002, particularly in unimproved plots.

## Implications and takeaways for data-driven decision-making
- For higher above-ground productivity, use Nitrogen and Lime together, but monitor soil moisture and chlorosis risks as pH approaches 7 and moisture stress can occur.
- Regular mowing to ~6 cm, especially in the absence of grazing, appears linked to bryophyte expansion and potential reductions in vascular plant diversity; consider adjusting disturbance regimes if biodiversity is a priority.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but not decisively causal; further controlled analyses would be needed to quantify impact on plant community structure.
- Trampling during intensive experimental activities can depress productivity; plan management activities to minimize short-term disturbance spikes.
- Long-term data show persistent shifts in functional composition toward stress-tolerant species in unimproved plots and toward competitive-stress-ruderal types in fertilised plots; this has implications for ecosystem function and resilience under nutrient enrichment and disturbance regimes.

## Conclusion
- The Sourhope site demonstrates clear, treatment-dependent shifts in productivity, plant composition, and functional group structure over four years, driven by mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide use, with strong interactions among soil pH, moisture, and disturbance. Bryophyte expansion and diversity changes accompany these shifts, highlighting the importance of disturbance regimes and soil chemistry in shaping grassland biodiversity and ecosystem function.
