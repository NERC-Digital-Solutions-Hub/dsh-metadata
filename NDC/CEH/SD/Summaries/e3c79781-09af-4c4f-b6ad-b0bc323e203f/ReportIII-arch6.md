# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and aims
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on an intensive, large-field experiment at Sourhope to provide broad context for linked studies and enable cross-year comparisons.
  - Baseline data survey completed November 1998; routine monitoring across 1999–2001 to support interpretation of detailed studies; emphasis on enabling data linkage and end-user self-service (dashboards, reports) through consistent data presentation.

- Data collection, design, and management
  - Site: Sourhope field experiment with a nutrient/diversity treatment matrix (including Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime, Biocide, and Controls).
  - Measurements and timing: Automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition (Point Quadrat surveys) collected on a prescribed schedule (1999–2001) to facilitate year-to-year links and cross-study comparisons.
  - Data quality and comparability: Point Quadrat surveys conducted by two surveyors with no significant inter-surveyor difference (NS). Data were transformed appropriately (e.g., ln-transformed biomass) for analyses.
  - 2001 site management events affecting data collection
    - Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions limited site visits February–May 2001; sampling proceeded under a site protocol thereafter.
    - Change of Officer in Charge in May 2001; most management activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) continued, with one biocide application in May 2001 missed.

- Results

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 headline weather data were broadly unremarkable.
    - Rainfall near long-term average (2001: ~839 mm; 1999–2000 were higher), with total radiation around 3473–3472 MJ m-2.
    - Slightly reduced average temperatures and marginally higher average soil moisture compared with previous years.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - A consistent treatment hierarchy: improved plots (N and/or L) yielded higher biomass than unimproved plots; biomass peaks in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass estimates increased substantially compared with earlier years, likely due to a combination of the personnel change and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
    - All treatment measures were normalized against C1 (control) in each year to trace positive effects of nitrogen and lime.
    - Statistical findings (ANOVA on ln-transformed data):
      - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L added) versus unimproved plots.
      - Significant year-by-treatment interaction.
      - No significant block effects.
    - Implication: nitrogen and lime additions continue to promote above-ground productivity, with 2001 results reinforcing the treatment effects.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime addition continued to elevate surface soil pH in the top 5 cm; October 2001 means: limed plots ~6.19; Nitrogen+Lime plots ~6.38.
    - Nitrogen addition alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent than lime or N+L.
    - Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (August 1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Quadrat protocol replicated 2000, with no detectable inter-surveyor differences.
    - 2001 survey captured 58% more hits than 2000, indicating higher plant density, possibly related to grazing removal in 1998.
    - Treatment-driven shifts in species composition (relative abundance by hits per species):
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments (remaining most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots).
      - Festuca species increased across treatments (F. ovina and F. rubra); most frequent in fertilised plots (notably F. rubra in Lime and N&L).
      - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed higher abundance of species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis; also Poa trivialis) than unimproved plots.
      - Species associated with poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) most apparent in unimproved plots.
    - Diversity patterns:
      - 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) versus 18 species in Nitrogen+Lime plots, suggesting a potential decline in diversity with strong fertility/liming.
    - Multivariate analysis:
      - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separates plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime from control/biocide plots.
      - Unimproved plots tend to cluster with species like Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus), Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum; improved plots show greater contact with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis.
    - Biomass–vegetation relationships:
      - Positive correlations: higher biomass associated with greater abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
      - Negative associations: higher biomass linked to declines in Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
      - Litter presence increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

- Site heterogeneity

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site; columns E and F (right-hand slope) contained more acidic plots than left-side columns, with an apparent undercurrent of heterogeneity in low pH within nitrogen- and/or lime-improved plots in these columns.
    - This spatial pattern supports non-uniform baseline conditions affecting treatment responses.

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Total biomass across plots showed outliers with particularly low biomass (e.g., several Control and treatment plots).
    - Generally, biomass tended to be higher in more central plots on the site (e.g., Nitrogen+Lime plots 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
    - There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant differences in biomass between blocks (ANOVA: F = 0.69, df = 5,4,20, p = 0.61).
