# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope: Summary

## Purpose and scope
- Four-year monitoring of a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, focusing on above-ground productivity (biomass), plant community composition, and diversity.
- Aimed to understand how management practices alter soil-plant interactions and functional plant communities.
- Data are gathered from standardized, replicated treatments to allow temporal comparisons and policy-relevant interpretation.

## Site, management, and data collection (Methods)
- Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block with randomised treatments, subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
- Treatments (five plot-level + one site-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (formerly Biocide). Treatments applied annually from 1999; mowing to ~6 cm monthly (May–Sept); lime and/or nitrogen applied in spring; insecticide (Dursban 4) applied post-mowing on insecticide plots.
- Data collection and monitoring (since 1998 baseline):
  - Above-ground biomass: harvested monthly during 5 summer cuts per year from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells, dried and weighed.
  - Botanical surveys: 0.5 m2 point quadrats (100-hole frame) in July/August, plus year-to-year baseline surveys; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
  - Soil: pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe) measurements; regular soil sampling totals 11,621 samples to date.
  - Weather: On-site Automatic Weather Station; rainfall, radiation, temperature, and moisture data collected continuously.
  - Additional small-scale surveys: biomass by species, litter hits, and long-term species composition data (Appendices list detailed datasets and species lists).
- Scope for data handling: Data are quality assured, standardised, stored, and uploaded to appropriate data portals; 2002 data used 13CO2 pulse experiments and multiple CEH mobile labs for some groups.

## Key findings (Results and Discussion)

### Overall productivity and treatment effects
- Fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime) consistently increases above-ground productivity; the strongest biomass is in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.
- In 2002, biomass generally declined relative to 2001 across most treatments, with the largest drop in Control 2 plots; slope position also influenced productivity (lower on steeper blocks).
- A positive association exists between soil pH (driven by lime) and productivity, especially when considering all plots; however, within nitrogen- or lime-only plots the relationship weakens, and in nitrogen+lime plots the relationship may become negative due to complex interactions with moisture.

### Plant community composition and functional groups
- Mowing (site-level disturbance reduction) shifts competition: Festuca rubra expands in more fertile plots; Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline by >40% since 2000, suggesting mowing-selective pressures or homogeneous cutting effects.
- Bryophyte expansion: Mosses and liverworts increase across the site, particularly under reduced disturbance and/or infertile conditions; bryophyte contribution to total hits rose across years, most pronounced in unimproved plots.
- Nutrient enrichment alters functional composition: In fertilised plots, stress-tolerant species decline relative to competitive species; nitrogen+lime plots show dominance by C-S-R and SR/C-S-R types, consistent with higher pH and nutrient availability.
- Point Analysis and PCA: Multivariate analyses show clear separation of improved (fertilised) vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster separately; some nitrogen-treated samples align with lime plots, indicating convergence under certain conditions.
- Shannon diversity index: Diversity generally increases in insecticide-treated plots and unimproved plots, while nitrogen+lime plots show reduced diversity by 2002; overall, 2002 diversity declined in the N&L treatments relative to the baseline, though increases were observed in other treatments.

### Insecticide and trampling effects
- Insecticide (Dursban 4) plots show relatively high Shannon diversity, but a direct causal link to increased diversity remains uncertain; results align with the idea that herbivory suppression can favor a broader range of palatable species under relatively infertile conditions.
- Trampling (C2 plots, associated with 13CO2 pulses) likely reduced productivity due to intense activity; 2002 C2 plots recorded notable productivity declines relative to C1 plots.

## Species and functional group dynamics (2000–2002)
- Dominant grasses and bryophytes: Agrostis spp. remain common, but Festuca spp. (notably F. rubra) increase in fertilised plots; bryophytes become a larger share of hits and biomass, especially as nutrient availability and disturbance decrease.
- Functional groups (S, C-S-R, SR/C-S-R) show divergent trajectories:
  - Stress-tolerators (S) gain on unimproved plots with lower disturbance and reduced fertility loss.
  - C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups expand in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots, with lime exerting strong influence on C-S-R dynamics due to pH effects.
  - SR/CSR species tend to be reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.

## Notable data points and indicators
- Block slope effects: productivity higher at the bottom blocks; lower on steeper blocks (Block 5 down 16% vs Block 1 down 30% in 2002).
- Soil pH and moisture: lime raises pH toward 7.0; a strong negative correlation exists between soil moisture and pH; moisture-related stress interacts with pH to influence biomass.
- 2002 biomass declines: although fertilised plots remained more productive overall, several treatments showed reduced biomass versus 2001, indicating potential saturation or moisture constraints.
- Bryophyte trends: consistent increase across treatments, especially in unimproved plots, linked to reduced disturbance and mowing height stability.

## Data quality, accessibility, and implications for monitoring
- Long-term, replicated data enable robust analysis of treatment effects on productivity, diversity, and functional composition.
- Datasets include weather, biomass, species hits, bryophyte lists, litter, and numerous Appendix datasets, with ongoing data storage and public portal uploads.
- Findings illustrate how standardized environmental monitoring supports assessment of policy-relevant outcomes and the value of integrating above- and below-ground indicators.

## Implications for monitoring practice
- Combining datasets from multiple sources (e.g., nutrient, disturbance, and pest management) enhances understanding of environmental health.
- Accessible, well-documented data allow stakeholders to scrutinise environmental health and policy performance over time.
- The Sourhope site demonstrates the value of long-term, standardized monitoring for detecting shifts in community structure, functional traits, and ecosystem productivity under different management regimes.
