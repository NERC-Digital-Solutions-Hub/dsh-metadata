# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, the site has been monitored for above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition and diversity in response to five main management treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen + Lime (N&L), plus Insecticide (Dursban) plots. The site was fenced from grazing in 1998 and undergoes monthly mowing (to ~6 cm) from 1999 onward.
- Data collected include: on-site weather data, annual above-ground biomass (by 0.5 m2 sampling within sub-plots), baseline and repeated point analyses (vegetation hits per 0.5 m2 cell), soil pH (5 cm depth) and moisture, bryophyte surveys, and species-level inventories (Appendices with species lists and treatment maps).
- The study uses a CSR functional framework (competitiveness, stress-tolerance, ruderal) to interpret shifts in plant communities, and applies statistical analyses (split-plot ANOVA; PCA) to relate treatments to productivity and community structure.

- Core findings across the study period (1999–2002):
  - Mowing and reduced disturbance (absence of grazing) favor stress-tolerant species and bryophyte expansion, while forcing a decline in some competitive grasses under unfertilised conditions.
  - Fertilisation (N and/or lime) consistently increases above-ground biomass, with the strongest productivity in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime; however, signs of productivity peaking or potential stress at high pH and/or lower soil moisture are observed by 2002.
  - Insecticide treatment shows the highest Shannon diversity in 2000–2002, though the exact causal link to reduced herbivory remains cautious; results align with broader insect-plant interaction literature.
  - Trampling in the newly surveyed C2 plots (2002) likely reduced productivity due to intense activity around 13CO2 pulse experiments.
  - Species composition shifts: improved pasture species (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) become more common in fertilised plots; Agrostis spp. decline with mowing; bryophytes (notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increase across the site, particularly in unimproved plots.
  - Point Analysis (2002) reveals clear treatment differences; PCA separates improved vs unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots forming a distinct group. Bryophytes contribute a sizable proportion of total hits and increase under several treatments.
  - Functional group dynamics (S, CSR, SR/CSR): Stress-tolerant (S) and SR/CSR groups expand in unimproved plots; C-S-R groups expand in nitrogen + lime plots; SR-C-S-R species decline where liming and insecticide reduce disturbance.

- Implications for data use:
  - The dataset supports understanding how mowing, nutrient amendments, and pest management interact to shape productivity and plant community structure in a semi-natural grassland system.
  - The combination of biomass, point analyses, soil chemistry, and functional group classification provides a multi-dimensional view of ecosystem responses to management.
  - Data limitations include occasional missing measurements (2002 weather data gaps; some C2 plots surveyed less extensively in 2000–2001) and variability due to slope position, trampling, and block effects.

- Endnotes:
  - The report includes extensive appendices with site maps, species lists, yearly biomass data, species abundance rankings, and a detailed 2002 point-analysis dataset, illustrating both species- and treatment-level changes over time.
