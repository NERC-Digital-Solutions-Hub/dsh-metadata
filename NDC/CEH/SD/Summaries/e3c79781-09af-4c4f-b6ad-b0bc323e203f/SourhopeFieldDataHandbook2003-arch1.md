    - pH(H2O) generally ~4.5–4.9 across auger horizons.
    - pH(CaCl2) around 3.8–4.1, depending on horizon.
- General pattern matches Block 4 horizon analyses: acidic, organic-rich surface horizons with high LOI, transitioning to more mineral, pH-lower horizons with lower LOI and moisture content at depth.

## BLOCK 4: Vegetation survey (Block 4)

- Plot-level tallies and species totals are recorded (plots 4A–4F):
  - Presence/absence indicators and counts for dominant species, edge vs center patterns, and overall species totals per subplot.

## Key takeaways for data-driven analysts

- The data comprise a well-documented, multi-block experimental framework with rich soil chemistry, moisture, and organic-matter metrics linked to vegetation composition.
- Dominant vegetation shows a core assemblage (various grasses) with clear associations to microtopography, soil moisture, and fertility gradients, enabling robust correlation and predictive modeling.
- Soil properties exhibit strong vertical and horizontal variation, with high surface organic content and LOI, acidic pH, and variable cation pools that could shift under management actions (e.g., liming, nitrogen inputs).
- The dataset supports longitudinal analyses and modeling of slow ecological responses, cross-block comparisons (Blocks 4 and 5), and integration with ECN-based long-term monitoring.
- Data quality is enhanced by horizon-level labeling, comprehensive metadata, and archival samples, enabling re-analysis and cross-study interoperability.
