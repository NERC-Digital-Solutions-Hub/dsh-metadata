# Pontbren Database Catalogue

- A comprehensive catalogue describing the Pontbren Database, covering instrumentation, data organization, quality assurance, and documentation to support reuse and governance.

## Purpose and Scope
- Documents a multi-site, multi-sensor data collection effort for long-term environmental monitoring.
- Emphasizes data provenance, quality assessment, and metadata to enable system-level analysis and decision-making.

## Data Organization and Access
- Data stored as plain text (.txt) files, organized by site and instrument type; filenames embed collection dates.
- Data structured into major folders (e.g., Quality Assured, AWS, groundwater, streamflow, tensiometer data, rain gauges, field diaries, etc.) with site-specific content.
- Appendices and site figures aid data discoverability and instrument layout understanding.

## Data Types and Collection Methods
- Weather and climate: Automatic Weather Station (AWS) data with high-frequency sensor readings (1-minute samples; 10-minute and daily averages).
- Hydrology: Bowl site runoff data, weir boxes, tipping buckets; streamflow data from Starflow and weirs; stage height, velocity, and calibrated flow.
- Groundwater and soil moisture: Multi-site boreholes with Diver transducers; neutron probe soil moisture data; tensiometer arrays (depths at 10, 30, 50 cm).
- Land and vegetation: Hillslope and land-use manipulation plots with tensiometers and overland flow measurements.
- Data collection logistics: Field diaries document observations and anomalies; borehole drilling and logging performed by contractors (e.g., Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd) with detailed borehole descriptions.
- N-probes and probes: N-probe data for soil moisture at various sites (e.g., NP20–NP23) with depth-specific logs and completion details.

## Quality Assurance, Metadata, and Documentation
- Extensive QA framework (Appendix A) with standardized codes for data quality, equipment status, and fault conditions (e.g., sensor faults, calibration issues, rodent damage, power issues, de-gassing, etc.).
- Site-specific borehole logs, logs of equipment and methods, and detailed borehole information (Appendices B–D) to support data provenance and reuse.
- Field diaries accompany datasets to explain anomalies or calibration notes.

## Data Access, Formats, and Discoverability
- Data are accessible as plain text files, with clear folder contents and embedded dates to aid discovery.
- QA codes enable rapid screening of data suitability for calibration and analysis.
- Calibration equations and metadata (e.g., Starflow calibrations, tensiometer depths, neutron probe calibrations) are documented to ensure consistent analyses.

## Equipment, Sites, and Documentation Details
- Borehole and drilling records include equipment lists (hand augers, AQ drill rods, hydraulic/air-flush drills), grid references, datums, soil descriptions, depths, completion tubing, and sampling intervals.
- Multiple N-probe locations across sites (e.g., bowl, hillslope, tree plots, Llyn Hir) with site-specific soil profiles and logs (NP20–NP23, NP21, NP22).
- Site-specific measurements and logs (e.g., sediment types, moisture content, groundwater headings) documented to support data interpretation and calibration.

## Challenges and Considerations for Data Leaders
- Understanding diverse user needs and enabling co-ownership of data products.
- Gaining a holistic view of scattered data sources and gaps at the required granularity.
- Access barriers (paywalls, data protection) and variability in data standards.
- Efficient verification of data content and formats; maintaining metadata clarity and data quality over long timeframes.
- Coordinating across sectors to reduce duplication and foster communities of practice.
- Long-term data quality challenges (calibration drift, equipment changes, environmental damage).

## Value and Use for Data Leadership
- Enables system-wide analysis and integration across sites, instruments, and data types.
- Supports identifying data gaps, prioritizing data collection, and aligning with user needs.
- Provides a robust framework for data governance, QA, and traceability through comprehensive metadata, QA codes, and field documentation.
