# Llyn Hir tensiometes

## Overview
- A maintenance and data log for the Llyn Hir tensiometer, recording downloads, offset corrections, degassing, maintenance, and issues affecting data collection between 2008 and 2009.

## Data Quality and Adjustments
- 16/10/08: Data downloaded; logger time read 14/10/08; potential need to adjust dataset time.
- 25/11/08: Offset changed from -4.8 to 0 on the logger.
- 28/11/08: Offset originally -4.8 indicated; should be +4.8; data adjusted accordingly to reflect this correction.
- 29/04/09: Degassed tensiometer after download.
- 03/07/09: Irregular blips in data at irregular times; data loss around those periods; suspected logger issue.
- 26/08/09 vs 02/09/09: Data stops short of expected date, indicating an incomplete data period.

## Maintenance and Operational Actions
- 13/05/09: Grass cutting noted at the site (potential environmental influence on readings).
- 31/07/09: Logger could not respond; batteries replaced but no improvement.
- 12/08/09: Logger stopped logging; reset and restarted to resume data collection.
- 02/09/09: Sampling interval changed from 10 to 15 minutes to reduce site visits to once per month.

## Data Gaps and Implications
- Irregular blips and data stop indicate reliability issues and incomplete data coverage during certain periods.
- Offsets and time synchronization adjustments highlight the need for thorough metadata and provenance to ensure reproducibility.

## Recommendations for Data Support
- Maintain and publish detailed provenance: document all time offsets, corrections, and why they were applied.
- Implement regular hardware checks: monitor logger health, battery status, and communication reliability.
- Investigate and address irregular data blips: assess firmware, revisit logging equipment, and consider redundant logging or alerting for anomalies.
- Review sampling cadence against site access to balance data cadence with practicality; ensure complete data coverage where possible.
- Ensure clear, accessible metadata accompanies datasets to support end users in self-serve analysis and interpretation.
