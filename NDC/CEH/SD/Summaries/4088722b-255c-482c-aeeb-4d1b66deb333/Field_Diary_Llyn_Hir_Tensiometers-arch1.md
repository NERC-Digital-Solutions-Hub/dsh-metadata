# Llyn Hir tensiometes

## Overview
- A log documenting tension measurements at Llyn Hir from Oct 2008 to Sep 2009, including data quality notes, equipment maintenance, and adjustments to the dataset.

## Data processing and adjustments
- 25/11/08: Offset changed from -4.8 to 0 on the logger.
- 28/11/08: Note that the offset had originally been -4.8 cm H2O and should be +4.8 cm; data adjusted accordingly.
- 29/04/09: Tensioe (tension readings) degassed after download, indicating post-processing to improve data quality.

## Field maintenance and operational interruptions
- 13/05/09: Grass cut at the site (potentially affecting site access or sensor exposure).
- 31/07/09: Could not get a response from the logger; batteries replaced but no sustained response.
- 12/08/09: Logger stopped logging; system reset and restarted.

## Sampling and data collection changes
- 02/09/09: Time sampling interval changed from 10–15 minutes to monthly site visits to reduce field workload.

## Data quality issues and gaps
- 03/07/09: Irregular blips and data loss around certain periods; suspected logger issue.
- Data stops short on 26/08/09 rather than 02/09/09, indicating a data gap at the end of the series.

## Implications for analysis
- Historical analyses must account for corrected offsets and degassing adjustments.
- Data gaps and periods of logger outages require careful treatment (imputation avoidance, uncertainty notes).
- Metadata should reflect maintenance events, sampling interval changes, and degassing steps to ensure reproducibility.

## Data provenance and metadata considerations
- The log provides timestamps and actions essential for tracing data lineage and validating analyses.
