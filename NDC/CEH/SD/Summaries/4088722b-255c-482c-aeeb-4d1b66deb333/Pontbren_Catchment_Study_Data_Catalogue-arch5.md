# Introduction to the DATABASE Catalogue

- This section provides Equipment & Methods details for borehole logging and N-probe manipulation sites within the Pontbren/CAEREINION area, prepared for Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and undertaken by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd.
- Documents multiple boreholes (NP20, NP21, NP22, NP23) at sites including PEN-TAL-Y-CEIN LLANFAIR CAEREINION and COED CWM-Y-LLWYNOG LLANFAIR CAEREINION, with N-probe monitoring at Tree/Edge of wood locations.
- Data collection occurred on 14/05/06, using hand auger, AQ drill rod / guide tube, pneumatic hammer, Atlas Copco RAB and Leopard drills, and aluminium 16 gauge access tubes; borehole logs were recorded and labeled (e.g., NP20, NP21, NP22, NP23) with associated site information and grid references.

## Borehole Logs and Site Details

- NP20, NP21, NP22, NP23 entries include:
  - Location and site designation (e.g., Site S3 easternmost/central/westernmost; N-probe manipulation plots).
  - Grid references (e.g., SJ 07360 06833; SJ 07341 06821; SJ 07426 06920).
  - Datum level and ground level references; depth (mBGL); thickness measurements.
  - Lithology descriptions with detailed soil textures and mottling (e.g., dark yellow brown silty clay; soft - firm olive brown clay; gravelly CLAY with mottling).
  - Completion details (16 gauge aluminium access tubing, 44.5 mm diameter) and sample intervals (e.g., 0.25–1.60 m, 0.85–1.50 m, 1.20–1.55 m).
  - Date of logging and site notes; presence/absence of groundwater (e.g., “Water Not struck”).
  - Notes on borehole construction and depth sequence across multiple depths and intervals.
- Each borehole log includes site-specific descriptions of soil horizons, thicknesses, reduced levels, and water presence status, alongside standardized completion tubing and sampling details.

## Data Provenance and Documentation

- Logs explicitly state that work was carried out for the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and that borehole work was conducted by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd.
- Documentation includes structured fields such as Datum level, Ground level, Depth mBGL, Thickness, and Description, enabling lithology- and depth-based interpretation.
- Recurrent references to site nomenclature (e.g., N-probe, Trees/Edge of wood, Manipulation plots) and to the precise grid coordinates support spatial traceability and cross-site comparability.

## Appendix D: Streamflow Gauging and Spot Measurements

- Contains a dataset of streamflow gauging site measurements with flow metered estimates.
- Each entry records start and finish times, and the corresponding flow metered estimate (ls-1 or similar), across multiple sites (Site 4, Site 7-9, Site 10, Site 13, Site 3, etc.) and dates (e.g., 2005–2009 period implied by timestamps).
- Data are intended for calibration/validation of instrumented flow measurements (e.g., Starflow devices) against manual spot measurements, facilitating site-specific calibrations and quality checks.

## Implications for Data Governance and Reuse

- Provides rich provenance with exact drilling methods, site locations, grid references, and lithology logs, enabling robust interpretation and reuse.
- Standardized borehole logging data (depths, thickness, descriptions, completion tubing) supports cross-site integration with other dataset components (e.g., tensiometer, groundwater, and streamflow data) in the overall DATABASE Catalogue.
- Precise dating, site identifiers, and contractor details enhance transparency, reproducibility, and auditability for data stewards and users.

## Data Stewardship Considerations and Challenges

- Ensuring consistent metadata across borehole logs (units, depth references, lithology coding) for interoperability with other datasets.
- Maintaining alignment between borehole records and other instruments' datasets (e.g., N-probe arrays, streamflow measurements) across diverse sites.
- Dealing with potential gaps or variations in documentation (e.g., changes in logging equipment or site nomenclature) while preserving traceability.
- Integrating these logs with QA documentation and calibration parameters to support discoverability and reliable reuse.
