# Llyn Hir tensiometes

## Overview
- A log of data collection and equipment status for Llyn Hir tensiometes spanning 2008–2009, detailing data adjustments, logger issues, and site maintenance.

## Data events and adjustments
- 16/10/08: Data downloaded; time reference may require dataset adjustment.
- 25/11/08: Logger offset changed from -4.8 to 0 cm H2O.
- 28/11/08: Note states the original offset was -4.8 cm; it should be +4.8 cm; data adjusted accordingly.
- 29/04/09: Degassed llyn hir tensios after download.
- 13/05/09: Grass cut at site.
- 31/07/09: Logger unresponsive; batteries replaced but no response.
- 12/08/09: Logger stopped logging; reset and restarted.
- 02/09/09: Sampling interval changed from 10 to 15 minutes to reduce site visits to once a month.
- 03/07/09: Irregular blips in data causing data loss around certain periods; suspected logger issue; data stops earlier (26/08) than expected (02/09).

## Data quality and governance implications
- Calibration and offset management: discrepancies between reported and actual offsets (e.g., -4.8 vs +4.8 cm) require careful provenance and reprocessing.
- Equipment reliability: periodic logger failures and resets impact data continuity and reliability.
- Sampling and timing: changes to sampling interval affect temporal resolution and comparability.
- Metadata and documentation: scattered notes (offsets, maintenance, degassing, grass cutting) highlight the need for comprehensive metadata and change logs.
- Data integrity risks: irregular blips and unexplained data gaps necessitate validation, anomaly detection, and clear reporting of issues.

## Alignment with Data Leaders aims
- Demonstrates managing a sensor-based data system with attention to data availability, quality, and provenance.
- Highlights coordination with field maintenance (degassing, grass cutting, battery changes) to preserve data usability.
- Emphasizes the importance of metadata, discoverability, and updates to ensure data products meet user needs.

## Recommendations for practice
- Maintain a centralized metadata repository recording offsets, sampling intervals, degassing events, maintenance actions, and data corrections.
- Implement routine data quality checks to flag anomalies, gaps, and early stops in logging.
- Establish automated alerts for logger downtime and data drops to prompt timely interventions.
- Use versioned datasets and clear change logs when applying corrections (e.g., offset adjustments).
- Schedule regular, documented maintenance plans to minimize data gaps while balancing field logistics.
