# Equipment & Methods

## Overview
- Describes drilling and groundwater monitoring procedures, including borehole construction logs, site locations, and N-probe manipulation plots.
- Conducted for CEH (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) at multiple plots around Llanfair Caereinion (Wales), with detailed site references and grid coordinates.
- Main equipment: hand auger with AQ drill rod/guide tube; pneumatic hammer; Atlas Copco RAB hand-held air flush rotary drill; Atlas Copco Leopard rotary/percussive drill (varies by borehole).
- Construction details: aluminium access tubes (16 gauge, 44.5 mm diameter) and site-specific borehole logs.

## Borehole logs and sites (NP20–NP23)
- NP20 (Site S3 easternmost) and NP21 (Site S3 central) near PEN-TAL-Y-CEIN LLANFAIR CAEREINION; multiple entries document grid refs SJ 07360 06833 and SJ 07341 06821 respectively.
- NP22 (Site S3 westernmost) with grid ref SJ 07323 06807; NP23 located at COED CWM-Y-LLWYNOG LLANFAIR CAEREINION, N-probe Tyn y Fron Trees edge of wood; all logged on 14/05/06.
- For each borehole:
  - Drill method and borehole log details (including date, datum level, and completion tubing).
  - Depths and thickness of soil/sediment layers with descriptive lithology (e.g., silty/clayey soils, soft to stiff clays, gravelley/clayey mixtures, sandstone/mudstone fragments).
  - Water presence: notes such as “Water Not struck” at several intervals; water depth data documented where present.
  - N-probe manipulation plots: NP20–NP23 associated with plots 3.1 (Site S3 easternmost), 3.2 (central), and 3.3 (westernmost), with site names and grid references provided.
  - Completion details: 16 gauge aluminium access tubing lengths and depths (e.g., depths to 1.58 m, 1.60 m), with samples also recorded (e.g., Samples 0.80–1.60 m; 1.20–1.55 m).
  - Lithology progression includes transitions such as dark yellow brown silty clay, moist brownish-yellow clays with mottling, stiff olive brown clay with gravel, and gravely CLAY with sandstone/mudstone fragments.
- Documentation includes repeated headers indicating:
  - Location descriptions (e.g., PEN-TAL-Y-CEIN LLANFAIR CAEREINION, N-probe manipulation plot 3.x, Site S3 variants).
  - Sheet references and datum levels, with explicit grid references and dates (Date 14/05/06).
  - Borehole logs supplied by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd.
- Data presentation format: borehole logs presented as “BOREHOLE LOG,” with sections for Thickness, Depth mBGL, and Descriptions; cluttered OCR formatting in the text reflects sheet-by-sheet logging across NP20–NP23.

## Data provenance and context
- Logs explicitly state the boreholes were carried out for the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
- Documents the development of groundwater monitoring at multiple tool-equipped plots (S3 eastern/central/western configurations) within the Pontbren study area.
- Each borehole entry includes standard fields: location, grid reference, datum level, date, depth intervals, material descriptions, and completion tubing details.

## Appendix D: Streamflow gauging site measurements
- Includes streamflow gauging flow metered spot measurements with time stamps (start/finish times) and flow estimates.
- Data entries reference multiple sites (e.g., Site 10, Site 8, Site 7, Site 9, Site 6, Site 13, Site 4, Site 3, Site 1/2/5/11/12) and correspond to various measurement events.
- Flow metered estimates vary across time, with some entries listing multiple flow values per time window (e.g., “Flow metered estimate = 50.1 89.1”).
- Measurements serve calibration/validation purposes for streamflow assessments, with examples spanning several dates and times.
