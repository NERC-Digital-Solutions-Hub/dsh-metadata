# Pontbren Database Catalogue

- An environmental health monitoring catalogue describing instrumentation, data structure, quality assurance, and governance to support policy scrutiny and decision-making.
- Aimed at researchers and policy-makers requiring transparent, auditable monitoring data with clear metadata.

## Data Architecture and Organization

- Data organized in directories by six-month blocks; most data stored as .txt files with file names indicating collection date ranges.
- Metadata described where needed; appendices provide supplementary information to aid catalogue navigation.
- Quality assurance (QA) is integral, with QA codes assigned to data points; documentation for QA is detailed in Appendices.
- Documentation supports navigation and interpretation via supplementary materials like Table of Tables, Table of Figures, Field Diaries, and calibration records.

## Data Domains and Instrumentation

- Automatic Weather Station (AWS)
  - Location: Bowl within instrumented hillslope.
  - Sampling: 1-minute; outputs daily and 10-minute averages.
  - Variables: Incident radiation, wind speed/direction, soil temperature, relative humidity, air temperature, net radiation; some sensor improvements added post-2009.
- N-probe, Manipulation plots, and associated sites
  - N-probes NP20–NP23 with detailed borehole logs including grid references, datum levels, depths, soil descriptions, and completion tubing.
  - Sites include PEN-TAL-Y-CEIN / LLANFAIR CAEREINION (multiple sites: S3 easternmost/central/westernmost; specific grid references provided).
  - Soil stratigraphy documented (silty/clay soils, mottling, humic layers) and depth intervals (e.g., 0.25 m to 1.50 m, with additional intervals up to ~1.60 m).
  - Completion: 16 gauge aluminium access tubing; sampling depths and intervals recorded.
- Groundwater
  - Monitored with Diver pressure transducers in boreholes; BaroDiver used to correct for barometric pressure; outputs in height of water (cm) and temperature.
  - Boreholes logged by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd with detailed logs (e.g., profiles, soil/sediment descriptions, depths, grading, and completions).
- Runoff, soil water tension, and related instrumentation
  - Weirs, tensiometers (various depths), and related datasets associated with bowl and adjacent plots.
- Neutron probe soil moisture
  - Across bowls, hillslope, and plots; depth profiles typically every 10 cm to around 120 cm; moisture derived with site-specific calibrations.
- Rainfall and streamflow
  - Rain gauges: tipping bucket and storage gauges (units in mm or mm/day).
  - Streamflow: Starflow acoustic Doppler devices at multiple sites; bed-mounted configurations with calibration to spot measurements where applicable.
- Field documentation
  - Field diaries and calibration records accompany the borehole and sensor data to contextualize site conditions and data integrity.

## Quality Assurance, Metadata and Governance

- QA coding system (Appendix A) provides codes for tensiometers, tipping buckets, rainfall gauges, groundwater, starflow, calibration concerns, data gaps, equipment faults, rodent damage, and other anomalies.
- Supporting documentation includes borehole logs (Appendix B) and neutron probe access tubes (Appendix C) to aid verification and interpretation.
- Emphasis on data provenance and governance to ensure openness, traceability to data origins, and responsible storage/sharing of data.
- Rich metadata to verify dataset suitability for calibration, trend analysis, and policy evaluation; governance structures to avoid duplication and ensure data quality.

## How This Catalogue Supports Monitoring Frameworks and Policy Evaluation

- Provides a standardized, multi-site, multi-domain data foundation (weather, hydrology, soil moisture, groundwater, runoff) for evaluating flood risk, soil-plant-water dynamics, and land-use effects.
- Clear QA codes and comprehensive logs enable assessment of data reliability and comparability over time.
- Facilitates data integration for policy insights, including rainfall–runoff relationships, groundwater fluctuations, soil moisture dynamics, and effects of land-management interventions.
- Supports benchmarking, governance, and transparent reporting to stakeholders, while promoting openness and data provenance.

## Challenges, Limitations and Considerations for Use

- Data gaps and quality issues: Evaporation effects, rodent damage, sensor changes, and low-flow calibration limitations can affect data integrity.
- Silo risk and data accessibility: Despite centralization, organizational silos and access constraints may hinder timely data sharing.
- Metadata gaps: Inadequate metadata can impede rapid verification of data suitability for policy evaluation requirements.
- Data transformation needs: Some data require substantial processing, calibration, or transformation before policy analysis.

## Appendices and Supporting Materials

- Appendix A: Quality assurance coding system (detailed QA codes for tensiometers, rain gauges, tipping buckets, groundwater, starflow, calibration issues, and site conditions).
- Appendix B: Groundwater borehole logs (equipment, drilling details, groundwater levels, log entries).
- Appendix C: Neutron probe access tube logs (locations, logging details, calibration notes).
- Additional materials: Field diaries and calibration records to contextualize data issues and site conditions.
- Appendices emphasize openness, provenance, and governance to support robust policy evaluation.

## Equipment & Methods – Specific Borehole Logs (Illustrative)

- Documentation includes detailed borehole logs for NP20–NP23 at multiple N-probe manipulation plots (Sites S3 easternmost/central/westernmost) with:
  - Grid references, datum levels, depths, soil descriptions (e.g., silty/clay soils with mottling), and completion details (16 gauge aluminium tubing).
  - Dates (e.g., 14/05/06) and site designations (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) for borehole logging.
  - Indications of samples collected (depth intervals, thicknesses) and references to specific borehole numbers (NP20–NP23).
- Additional data include groundwater monitoring details and flow measurements at streamflow gauging sites, with recorded start/finish times and flow estimates.
