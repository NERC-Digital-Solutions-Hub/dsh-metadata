# Llyn Hir tensiometes

- A chronological log documenting data handling, quality assurance actions, and operational issues for tensiometer data from Llyn Hir between Oct 2008 and Sept 2009.
- Purpose: to ensure consistent, evaluable environmental data series by recording adjustments, degassing, maintenance, and sampling changes.

## Data Quality and Processing Notes
- 16/10/08: Data downloaded; potential time discrepancy: logger shows 14/10/08 00:17; may require dataset adjustment.
- 25/11/08: Offset corrected from -4.8 to 0 cm H2O on the logger.
- 28/11/08: Original offset was -4.8 cm H2O; corrected to +4.8 cm H2O; dataset adjusted accordingly.

## Data Cleaning and Maintenance
- 29/04/09: Degassed tensiometer readings after download.
- 31/07/09: Logger unresponsive; batteries replaced but no recovery.
- 12/08/09: Tensiometer stopped logging; reset and restart performed.

## Operational and Sampling Adjustments
- 02/09/09: Sampling interval increased from 10 to 15 minutes to reduce site visits to once per month.

## Data Anomalies and Gaps
- 03/07/09: Irregular blips in data causing data loss during certain periods; likely logger-related issue.
- Data cessation: data stops short of 26/08 rather than resuming on 02/09.

## Implications for Analysis
- Time stamps, offsets, and degassing status are critical for accurate time-series interpretation.
- Documented adjustments affect comparability; downstream analyses should account for offsets and potential logger issues.
- Gaps and irregular sampling must be considered when deriving environmental indicators or trends.

## Accessibility and Data Governance
- Emphasizes the need for access to underlying raw data and maintenance logs to validate outputs and support reproducibility.
