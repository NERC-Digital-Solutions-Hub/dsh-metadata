# Llyn Hir tensiometes

## Overview
- A log of tensiometer measurements at Llyn Hir (2008–2009) detailing data adjustments, maintenance actions, and issues affecting data quality and continuity.

## Data corrections and calibrations
- 16/10/08: Downloaded data; logger time read 14/10/08; potential need to adjust dataset due to time discrepancy.
- 25/11/08: Offset changed from -4.8 to 0 cm H2O on the logger; data adjusted accordingly.
- 28/11/08: Offset originally -4.8 cm H2O; should be +4.8 cm; data adjusted to reflect this correction.

## Maintenance and operational events
- 29/04/09: Degassed tensios after download.
- 13/05/09: Grass cut at site.
- 31/07/09: Could not get response from the logger; batteries replaced but no response.
- 12/08/09: Tension logger stopped logging; reset and restarted.
- 02/09/09: Sampling interval changed from 10–15 minutes to once per month to reduce site visits.

## Data quality and gaps
- 03/07/09: Reports of irregular blips at unpredictable times; data loss around these periods; believed to be a logger issue.
- Data stops short of 26/08 (instead of 02/09); gap indicates incomplete data sequence.

## Data governance implications
- Frequent calibration and offset corrections highlight the need for robust metadata and provenance.
- Adjustments (calibration, degassing) must be clearly documented to ensure reproducibility and transparent data quality assessment.
- Data sharing and visibility of underlying datasets are dependent on maintaining accurate time stamps, offsets, and maintenance records.

## Monitoring framework considerations
- Ensure audit trails for all calibration changes, maintenance actions, and sampling-interval adjustments.
- Maintain comprehensive metadata to verify data suitability and transformability (offsets, degassing, time corrections).
- Address data gaps and logger reliability to improve continuous environmental health monitoring and decision-making.
