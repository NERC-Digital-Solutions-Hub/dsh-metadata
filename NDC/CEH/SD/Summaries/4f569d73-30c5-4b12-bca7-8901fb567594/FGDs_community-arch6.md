# Supporting documentation for the dataset Qualitative data on land use change and ecosystem services from participatory study in northeastern, Kenya (August - October, 2013)

## Project aim and scope
- Collect qualitative data on land use change, ecosystem services, livelihoods, wealth, and livestock perceptions in northeastern Kenya.
- Generate datasets (transcripts and FGDScores) to support analysis and exploration by others.

## Study design and sampling
- Cross-sectional design with a village as the unit of analysis.
- Study sites: irrigated areas (Bura and Hola) and pastoral/riverine areas (Ijara and Sangailu).
- Village selection:
  - Irrigated: 13 villages selected from farming-dominated ones (out of 11 in Bura and 6 of 7 in Hola).
  - Pastoral: 25 villages chosen with greater focus on pastoral livelihoods.
- Participant recruitment: adults resident for at least 20 years; representation across age, gender, ethnicity, and livelihoods.
- Focus Group Discussions (FGDs): 10–12 participants per village; 1.5 hours per session; in pastoral areas, gender-specific FGDs (usually two per village).

## Data collection methods
- Ethical procedures: written/thumb-print consent obtained after informing participants about the project.
- Field team: three-person group per FGD (moderator, translator, note-taker); sessions audio-recorded with permission.
- FGD guide topics: livelihood practices, seasonality, wealth, gender roles, human and livestock diseases.
- Data collection tools: exercises such as simple ranking, proportional piling, disease incidence scoring, community resource mapping, and seasonal calendars.
- Wealth categorization: locally defined classes using indicators like livestock types, education, housing, assets, energy, livelihoods, and access to services.
- Data validation: informal discussions with key informants to clarify any unclear data.

## Analytical methods
- Transcription: FGDs transcribed, checked against field notes, anonymized, converted to text for analysis.
- Coding and analysis: framework based on Hennink et al. (2011); three researchers conducted coding with inter-coder reliability checks.
- Theme development: identify and compare themes within and across study sites to reveal patterns and linkages.

## Quality control
- Multidisciplinary research team to capture multiple dimensions.
- Validation of notes against digital transcripts to improve accuracy.
- Clarifications obtained from local key informants when needed.

## Data and datasets provided
- Dataset 1: 39 text transcripts, named by site and village (or interview group).
- Dataset 2: CSV file titled DDDAC_kenya_fgdscores.csv containing FGDScores from proportional piling exercises.
- Missing data: reflects sessions where proportional piling exercises were not used (to avoid compromising other data collection).

## Dataset contents and variables
- Serial_no: identifier for each focus group (unit of study).
- date: date of the interview/session.
- site: area name (Bura, Hola, Sangailu, or Ijara).
- village: village name.
- group: gender composition of the group.
- Rich_a: proportion of households perceived as rich (from proportional piling).
- Middle income_a: proportion in middle-income category.
- poor_a: proportion in poverty category.
- goats, sheep, donkeys, poultry, camels: proportions of each livestock type out of total livestock (from proportional piling).
- site (context): whether the village is irrigated, pastoral, or riverine area (contextual classification).
- Note: missing values indicate the exercise was not conducted in that session.
