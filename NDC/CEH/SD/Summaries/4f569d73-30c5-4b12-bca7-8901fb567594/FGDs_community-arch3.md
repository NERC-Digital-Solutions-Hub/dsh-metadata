# Supporting documentation for the dataset Qualitative data on land use change and ecosystem services from participatory study in northeastern, Kenya (August - October, 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Qualitative data on ecosystem services, livelihood practices, wealth and livestock, and human diseases from participatory study in northeastern Kenya.
  - Data collected via focus group discussions (FGDs) across diverse land-use settings (irrigated, pastoral, and riverine areas).

- Study design and sampling regime
  - Cross-sectional design with the village as the unit of analysis.
  - Sites chosen to reflect distinct land-use practices: Ijara and Sangailu divisions (pastoral) and Bura and Hola irrigation schemes (irrigated).
  - In irrigated sites, villages with farming as main livelihood activity (13 of 13 total in Bura, 6 of 7 in Hola) were included; excluded ones were periurban where farming was not primary.
  - In pastoral areas, a larger number of villages were identified and randomly selected (13 irrigated vs 25 pastoral villages used in the study).
  - Data collected covered ecosystem services, livelihood practices, wealth and livestock, and human diseases.
  - FGDs: 10–12 participants per village; sessions lasted ~1.5 hours; adults with ≥20 years residence included; gender-specific FGDs in pastoral areas to enhance participation (two FGDs per village in many pastoral areas).

- Field work and data collection methods
  - Ethical procedures: written/thumb print consent obtained after informing participants about the study.
  - FGDs conducted by a three-person team (moderator, translator, note-taker); sessions recorded with consent.
  - Data collection tools included a pretested FGD guide and visual exercises (photographs, etc.).
  - Activities used: simple ranking, proportional piling, disease incidence scoring, community resource mapping, seasonal calendars.
  - Wealth categorization based on locally defined indicators (types of livestock, education, housing, assets, energy source, livelihoods, and access to services); categories defined by participants as poor, middle income, and rich.
  - Data validation and clarification conducted via informal discussions with key informants.

- Analytical methods
  - Qualitative data transcribed and cross-checked against field notes; identifiers removed.
  - Transcripts saved as text files for text-mining analysis.
  - Analytical framework aligned with Hennink et al. (2011) for thematic analysis; coding performed by three researchers.
  - Inter-coder agreement used to ensure reliability; themes compared within and across sites to identify patterns and linkages.

- Quality control
  - Multidisciplinary team to ensure multidimensional perspectives.
  - Validation of paper notes against digital transcripts to improve accuracy.
  - Clarifications obtained from local key informants as needed.

- Data description and content
  - Dataset 1: 39 text transcripts named by site and village (focus groups).
  - Dataset 2: DDDAC_kenya_fgdscores.csv containing proportional piling scores with variables:
    - Serial_no: unit identifier for the focus group
    - date: interview date
    - site: Bura, Hola, Sangailu, or Ijara
    - village: village name
    - group: gender of the participants
    - rich a: proportion of households perceived as rich
    - middle income a: proportion of households perceived as middle income
    - poor a: proportion of households perceived as poor
    - goats a / sheep a / donkeys a / poultry a / camels a: proportions of each livestock type
    - site (duplicate): irrigation/pastoral/riverine classification
    - missing: indicates where an exercise was not used
  - Data notes
    - Transcripts anonymized and prepared for analysis; missing data indicated where exercises were not conducted.
    - Data file describes both socio-economic perceptions and livestock composition within each village session.

- Participants and roles
  - Key contributors: Salome Bukachi (design, implementation, data analysis), Caroline Mwihaki (implementation and analysis), Grace Delia (design), Bernard Bett (design, implementation, data analysis).
