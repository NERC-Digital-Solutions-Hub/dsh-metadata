# Qualitative data on land use change and ecosystem services from participatory study in northeastern, Kenya (August - October, 2013)

## Scope and purpose
- Qualitative data from a participatory study across four sites in northeastern Kenya to understand land use changes and ecosystem services.
- Aimed to capture ecosystem services, livelihood practices, wealth and livestock, and human diseases through focus group discussions (FGDs).
- Data prepared to support analysis and reuse, with attention to methodology and data structure for future users.

## Study design and sampling
- Sites: Ijara and Sangailu (pastoral area) and Bura and Hola irrigation schemes.
- Design: cross-sectional with village as the unit; purposive sampling to include villages where farming is a main livelihood in irrigated areas.
  - Irrigated: 13 villages; Hola: 6 of 7; Bura: 10 of 11.
  - Pastoral: 25 villages identified and included.
- Sampled FGDs: 10–12 adults per village, lasting ~1.5 hours.
- Participant recruitment: local mobilizers ensuring representation by age, gender, ethnicity, livelihood; in pastoral areas, men and women interviewed separately (mostly two FGDs per village).

## Data collection methods
- Ethics: written/thumb print consent obtained; information presented in local language; recordings made with permission.
- Field team: three-person groups per FGD (moderator, translator, note-taker); FGDs recorded digitally.
- FGD guide topics: livelihoods, seasons, wealth, gender roles, disease perceptions (human and livestock).
- Participatory exercises: simple ranking, proportional piling, disease incidence scoring, community resource mapping, seasonal calendars.
- Wealth classification: poor, moderate, rich, based on livestock, education, housing, assets, energy, livelihoods, and access to services.
- Data validation: unclear data clarified through informal discussions with key informants.

## Analytical methods
- Transcription and anonymization (identifiers removed); transcripts saved as text for analysis.
- Analytical framework: based on Hennink et al. (2011); three researchers coded transcripts and compared against predetermined themes.
- Inter-coder reliability checks conducted; themes categorized and compared within/between sites for patterns and linkages.

## Data management and quality control
- Multidisciplinary team used to broaden perspectives; notes validated against digital transcripts.
- Ambiguities discussed with local informants to improve accuracy.

## Data contents and structure
- Data set 1: 39 text transcripts named by site and village (or group interviewed).
- Data set 2: CSV file named DDDAC_kenya_fgdscores.csv with variables describing proportional piling results.
  - Variables include serial number, date, site (Bura, Hola, Sangailu, Ijara), village, group (gender), and proportion scores for wealth (rich, middle income, poor) and livestock categories (goats, sheep, donkeys, poultry, camels).
  - Some villages did not use the proportional piling exercise, resulting in missing values for those records.
- Data documentation provides variable descriptions for interpretation of the CSV.

## Provenance and personnel
- Principal contributors and roles: Salome Bukachi (design, implementation, data analysis), Caroline Mwihaki (implementation and analysis), Grace Delia (design), Bernard Bett (design, implementation, analysis).
- Geographical extent: coordinates 38.93, 41.14 (longitude min/max) and -1.89, -0.64 (latitude min/max) indicating study area in northeastern Kenya.
- Data referenced to methodological framework: Hennink, Hutter, Bailey (2011) Qualitative Research Methods.

## Ethics and access considerations
- Informed consent and confidentiality maintained; data anonymized in transcripts.
- Recordings used with participant permission; data prepared to support reuse while preserving privacy.
- Ownership details not explicitly stated; dataset prepared with explicit contributor credits and transparent data structure for reuse.

## Key notes for data stewardship
- Data formats: transcripts in text format; quantitative scores in a CSV; compatibility with text mining and qualitative analysis tools.
- Metadata opportunities: detailed site/village, group, gender, dates, and wealth/livestock indicators to support secondary analyses.
- Data quality considerations: missing values where proportional piling was not conducted; inter-coder reliability data implied but not quantified in the summary.
- Data governance implications: clear documentation of collection methods, analytical framework, and ethical practices to facilitate appropriate reuse and attribution.
