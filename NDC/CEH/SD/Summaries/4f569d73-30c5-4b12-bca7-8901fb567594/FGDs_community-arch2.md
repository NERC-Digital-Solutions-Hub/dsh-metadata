# Supporting documentation for the dataset Qualitative data on land use change and ecosystem services from participatory study in northeastern, Kenya (August - October, 2013)

## Purpose and scope
- Qualitative data on land use change and ecosystem services from a participatory study in northeastern Kenya (August–October 2013).
- Focus on ecosystem services, livelihood practices, wealth, livestock, and human diseases from diverse land-use settings.

## Study design and sampling
- Cross-sectional design with village as the unit of analysis.
- Sites: Ijara and Sangailu divisions (pastoral areas) and Bura and Hola irrigation schemes.
- Sampling rationale:
  - In irrigated sites, all villages where farming is the main livelihood were included (13 irrigated villages total; 10 of 11 in Bura; 6 of 7 in Hola).
  - In pastoral areas, more villages were identified and randomly selected (25 pastoral/riverine villages).
- Final sample: 13 irrigated villages and 25 non-irrigated/pastoral villages.
- Data collected: qualitative data on ecosystem services, livelihood practices, wealth, livestock, and human diseases.
- Data collection tool: focus group discussions (FGDs) guided by a pretested guide; included visual tools and exercises.

## Data collection methods
- Informed consent: written or thumbprint; information read aloud per ethical guidelines.
- FGDs: conducted by a three-person team (moderator, translator, note-taker); sessions recorded with consent.
- Participant criteria: adults who have lived in the area for at least 20 years.
- Participant groups: in pastoral areas, separate gender groups; typically two FGDs per village; 10–12 participants per session; ~90 minutes.
- FGD topics and exercises: livelihood practices, seasonality, wealth profiles, gender roles, disease perceptions; ranking, proportional piling, disease incidence scoring, community resource mapping, seasonal calendars.
- Wealth categorization: participants defined categories as poor, moderate, rich based on livestock, education, housing, assets, energy, livelihoods, and access to services. Unclear data verified through informal discussions with key informants.

## Analytical methods
- Transcription and de-identification; transcripts saved as text for analysis.
- Analytical framework: as per Hennink et al. (2011) qualitative methods; three researchers conducted separate readings and coding against predetermined themes.
- Reliability: inter-coder agreement checked to ensure coding reliability.
- Cross-site comparison: themes compared within and across study sites to identify patterns and linkages.

## Quality control
- Multidisciplinary team enabled probing from multiple perspectives.
- Validation of paper notes against digital transcripts to improve accuracy.
- Clarification sought from local key informants when needed.

## Data and file descriptions
- Dataset 1: 39 text transcripts, named by site and village or group.
- Dataset 2: DDDAC_kenya_fgdscores.csv with variables described below.
  - Variables include: Serial_no, date, site (Bura, Hola, Sangailu, Ijara), village, group (gender), Rich a, Middle income a, poor a, goats, sheep, donkeys, poultry, camels, and a site descriptor (irrigated, pastoral, or riverine).
  - Proportions for wealth and livestock are from proportional piling exercises; some villages did not use these exercises, resulting in missing values.
- Data notes: missing records indicate sessions where particular exercises were not performed.
