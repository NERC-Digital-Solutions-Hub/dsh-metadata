# Supporting documentation for the dataset
Qualitative data on land use change and ecosystem services from participatory study in northeastern, Kenya (August - October, 2013)

- Study design and sampling
  - Sites: distinct land use practices in Ijara and Sangailu divisions (pastoral area) and Bura and Hola irrigation schemes (irrigated area).
  - Design: cross-sectional with village as the unit of analysis.
  - Village selection: irrigated sites - all farming-dominated villages (13 of 11 in Bura, 6 of 7 in Hola were sampled); peripheral periurban irrigated villages excluded. Pastoral areas: more villages identified and randomly selected (13 irrigated-like vs 25 pastoral villages used in total).
  - Data collected focus: qualitative data on ecosystem services, livelihoods, wealth and livestock, and human diseases.
  - FGD design: a guide prepared and pretested; FGDs in each village with 10–12 adults, lasting ~1.5 hours; in pastoral areas, male and female groups conducted separately (two FGDs per village in most cases).

- Fieldwork and data collection methods
  - Consent: written/thumb-print consent obtained prior to FGDs.
  - Team composition: three-person FGD teams (moderator, translator, note-taker); sessions audio-recorded with permission.
  - Data collection tools: FGD guide plus exercises (simple ranking, proportional piling, disease incidence scoring, community resource mapping, seasonal calendars).
  - Wealth assessment: based on livestock types, education, housing, assets, energy source, livelihoods, and access to services; wealth categories defined by participants (poor, moderate, rich).
  - Data verification: clarifications sought through informal discussions with key informants.

- Analytical methods
  - Transcription and de-identification: transcripts converted to text, identifiers removed, checked for accuracy.
  - Text processing: transcripts formatted in Word (2013) and saved as text for text mining.
  - Framework and coding: analysis using Hennink et al. (2011) qualitative framework; three researchers coded against predetermined themes; inter-coder agreement assessed.
  - Cross-site analysis: themes compared within and across sites to identify patterns and linkages.

- Quality control
  - Multidisciplinary field team to capture multiple dimensions.
  - Validation of notes against transcripts to improve accuracy.
  - Clarifications provided by local informants for interpretation.

- Data and format
  - Dataset 1: 39 text transcripts named by site and village or interview group.
  - Dataset 2: CSV file titled DDDAC_kenya_fgdscores.csv with variables:
    - Serial_no: unit identifier (focus group)
    - date: interview date
    - site: Bura, Hola, Sangailu, or Ijara
    - village: village name
    - group: gender of group members
    - Rich: proportion of households perceived to be rich
    - Middle_income: proportion of households perceived to be middle income
    - poor: proportion of households perceived to be poor
    - goats, sheep, donkeys, poultry, camels: proportions of each livestock type out of total livestock
    - site (duplicate): irrigated, pastoral, or riverine area
  - Notes: proportions derived from proportional piling; missing values indicate the exercise was not used in that session.
