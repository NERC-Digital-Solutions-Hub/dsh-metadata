# Supporting documentation for the dataset Qualitative data on land use change and ecosystem services from participatory study in northeastern, Kenya (August - October, 2013)

## Overview
- Qualitative dataset documenting land use change, ecosystem services, livelihoods, wealth, and diseases from participatory FGDs in northeastern Kenya (Aug–Oct 2013).
- Focuses on community perceptions and knowledge gathered through participatory methods in four area contexts (Ijara, Sangailu, Bura, Hola).

## Study design and sampling
- Cross-sectional design with village as the unit of analysis.
- Sites include pastoral and irrigated areas: Ijara and Sangailu (pastoral); Bura and Hola (irrigated).
- Villages were selected based on farming being a main livelihood (irrigated sites) or as representative of pastoral areas (pastoral sites). 13 irrigated villages and 25 pastoral villages included.
- Data collection targeted adults with long-term residence (≥20 years); gender groups varied by area (separate FGDs for men and women in most pastoral areas).

## Data collection methods
- Focus group discussions (FGDs) with 10–12 participants per village session, lasting ~1.5 hours.
- Informed consent obtained; sessions recorded with permission.
- FGDs conducted by a three-person team (moderator, translator, note-taker).
- Tools and activities: livelihood practices, seasonality, wealth profiles, gender roles, perceptions of human/livestock diseases; exercises such as simple ranking, proportional piling, disease incidence scoring, community resource mapping, and seasonal calendars.
- Wealth categorization defined by participants (poor, middle income, rich) along with livestock ownership, education, housing, assets, energy source, livelihoods, and access to services.
- Data verification through informal discussions with key informants.

## Analytical methods
- Qualitative data transcription, anonymization, and formatting for text analysis.
- Analysis guided by Hennink et al. (2011) thematic framework; coding conducted by three researchers.
- Inter-coder reliability checked; themes compared within and across sites to identify patterns and linkages.

## Quality control
- Multidisciplinary research team ensured comprehensive probing of perceptions.
- Validation of notes against digital transcripts to improve accuracy.
- Clarifications obtained from local key informants as needed.

## Data content and structure
- Data set 1: 39 text transcripts named by site, village, and group interviewed.
- Data set 2: CSV file (DDDAC_kenya_fgdscores.csv) with variables:
  - Serial_no, date, site (Bura, Hola, Sangailu, Ijara), village, group (gender), Rich a, Middle income a, poor a, goats a, sheep a, donkeys a, poultry a, camels a, site (irrigated/pastoral/riverine).
- Notes: Proportions (wealth and livestock) derived from proportional piling exercises; some sessions did not include this exercise, resulting in missing values.
- Contributors: Salome Bukachi (design, implementation, data analysis), Caroline Mwihaki (implementation, analysis), Grace Delia (design), Bernard Bett (design, implementation, data analysis).

## Geographic context
- Geographical extent: block coordinates 38.93, 41.14 (longitude min/max) and -1.89, -0.64 (latitude min/max).

## Potential GIS applications
- Link qualitative themes to spatial units (villages) for map-based storytelling of land use change and ecosystem services.
- Combine with village-level coordinates to produce maps showing differences between irrigated vs pastoral contexts.
- Integrate FGD-derived wealth and livestock composition indicators as contextual attributes in GIS layers.
- Support participatory mapping outputs (community resource maps) to complement spatial datasets and aid policy discussions.
