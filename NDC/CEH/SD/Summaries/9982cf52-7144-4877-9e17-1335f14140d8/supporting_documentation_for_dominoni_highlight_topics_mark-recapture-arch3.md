# Collection/generation methods: Study sites

## Overview
- An approximately 35-kilometre urban–non-urban gradient was monitored, spanning Glasgow city centre to Loch Lomond National Park, Scotland.
- The gradient has been surveyed annually from 2014 to 2022, using 5 to 20 sites per year.
- Focus species: blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tit (Parus major) nestbox populations.
- Monitoring period for nestboxes: 1 April to 20 June each year; productivity based on breeding attempts in nestboxes.
- Opportunistic mist netting conducted outside the breeding season to supplement mark–recapture data and collect data on other passerines.

## Field methods and data collection
- Nestbox monitoring schedule:
  - From 1 April: weekly checks until incubation begins.
  - Record date of first egg lay and clutch size.
  - During incubation: no checks for 14 days to minimise disturbance.
  - After chicks are observed: nestboxes checked every other day until hatching is confirmed; then attempts to catch breeding adults around 13 days after hatching.
  - Nestlings are ringed by 13 days old with unique metal rings if not already ringed previously.
- Adult and nestling data:
  - Adults are marked with unique metal rings or their existing ring number noted.
  - Nestlings in each brood are ringed with unique metal rings.
- Morphometric and capture data:
  - Measurements collected: wing length, weight, tarsus length, fat score, and other standardized measurements.
  - Morphology and health data recorded at processing (e.g., moult, muscle score, etc.).
  - RFID and radio tagging documented when applicable.
- Additional data collection:
  - Opportunistic mist netting outside the breeding season to supplement data and capture bycatch information for other species.
  - Sexing during breeding season via brood patches or cloacal protrusion; outside breeding season by plumage when uncertain.
- Site management and data linkage:
  - All yearly data are uploaded to a central long-term Access database, enabling linkage between reproductive attempts and individual bird information (mark–recapture data).
  - Data and individual records are deposited with the European Invertebrate and Data Centre (EIDC).

## Data management and structure
- Data management:
  - End-of-year data checks are performed before uploading to the central database.
  - Data are structured to link capture events with individual birds and reproductive outcomes.
- Data structure:
  - Rows correspond to individual capture events; columns contain event details (e.g., year, retrap status, ring number, species, age, sex, date, time, site, morphometrics, and processing initials).
  - A comprehensive Table 1 defines fields such as ID, year, retrap status, ring_number, species codes, age codes, sex, date/time, site, wing, weight, initial, moult, tarsus, fat, chick counts, nestbox number, notes, chick age, parent rings, RFID/radio-tag data, color ring information, CES visit numbers, and related notes.
- Data dictionaries and coding:
  - Table 2 provides BTO age codes (0–6 and J variants) with explanations for aging birds (e.g., pullus, fledged, fully grown, etc.).
  - Fat score codes follow the BTO fat scoring system and linked BWG/ESF scale explanations.
  - External references and codes used include Redfern & Clark (Ringers’ Manual) and BTO resources for age and fat scoring.

## Site and data specifics
- Study sites include a mix of urban parks, forests, and other locales (e.g., SCENE, sallochy, cashel, cochno, dawsholm, dowanhill_park, drymen_forest, drymen_village, garscube, hillfoot, kelvingrove_park, killearn_forest, kilmardinny_loch, mugdock, old_station_park, rose_street, st_mungo_avenue, strathblane_forest, strathblane_village, tannoch_burn, bearsden_garden, knows_woodland, yorkhill, and others or grid references).
- A central Access database ties together annual field data with individual birds and reproductive outcomes, while data sharing is facilitated through deposition with EIDC.

## Quality control and governance
- Quality control:
  - Annual data verification and upload to the central database ensure data integrity and traceability.
- Data governance and openness:
  - Data are maintained in a central, long-term repository with clear provenance (capture events linked to individuals; metadata maintained).
  - Public sharing of underlying data is facilitated via deposit in the EIDC, aligning with openness and data management standards.
- Data transformation and usability:
  - Data collection uses standardized measures and coding (e.g., BTO codes for species, age, fat scores) to enable cross-study comparability and clear interpretation.
