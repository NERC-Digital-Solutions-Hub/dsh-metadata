# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- A detailed soil profile and associated data for Block 4 at the Sourhope site, including horizon descriptions, laboratory analyses, auger samples, vegetation surveys, and ECOTRON site data, with barcoded sample management (MLURI Barcodes).

## Overview of content and purpose
- Describes the vertical soil sequence (horizon-by-horizon) from the surface down to Cg in Block 4, plus ancillary auger, vegetation, and ECOTRON data.
- Data are organized to support cross-plot comparisons, soil–vegetation relationships, and long-term biodiversity monitoring within the UK ECN framework.
- Includes site details, horizon-specific chemistry, moisture metrics, pH, and substrate characteristics (e.g., presence of igneous stones).

## Data collection and horizon descriptions (Block 4)
- Horizons and depths (example sequence):
  - LF: 0–1 cm; fibrous, moist; no mineral grains; boundary clear.
  - FH: 1–4 cm; fibrous, moist; abundant fine roots; boundary sharp.
  - H: 4–8 cm; dark color, amorphous; moist; weak blocky structure; roots present.
  - Ah: 8–29 cm; very dark, sandy silt loam; friable; many fine roots; intermediate igneous stones; boundary sharp.
  - Abg: 29–40 cm; pinkish/grey with mottles; coarse sandy silt loam; stones present; boundary smooth.
  - B sg: 40–61 cm; brown, mottled; sandy silt loam; moderate blocky structure; boundary sharp.
  - C gx: 61–95 cm; reddish-brown to brown; sandy clay loam; massive to platy structure; abundant igneous stones; boundary to lower horizons.
- Key soil properties (horizon-specific):
  - %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Notable patterns: upper horizons rich in organic matter (high %C and LOI) with acidic pH; deeper horizons show reduced exchangeable cations and variable moisture; Ca and Mg higher in surface horizons (e.g., FH) and generally decline with depth.
  - pH generally acidic to mildly acidic across horizons; Ca/Mg concentrations higher in surface horizons; LOI values high in Ah and FH regions, indicating substantial organic matter.
- Sample identification:
  - Samples are linked to MLURI Barcodes for traceability (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg).

## Auger samples (Block 4)
- Auger cores 4A–4F; measured properties include wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- General patterns:
  - %N and %C are modest in auger samples with C:N typically around 12–14.
  - Ca, Mg, and other cations show low to moderate values, with Mg often higher than Na.
  - pH values indicate acidic to borderline acidic conditions (pH(H2O) roughly 4.5–4.9; CaCl2 values around 3.5–4.2).
  - LOI and moisture loss reflect substantial organic matter and moisture storage in near-surface horizons.

## Vegetation survey (Block 4)
- Vegetation data organized by plots (e.g., 4A, 4B, 4C, etc.) and subplots, with species totals or counts recorded per subplot.
- Data structure supports analyses of species presence/absence, abundance, and associations across plots and microhabitats (edges vs interiors, moisture gradients).
- Enables linking vegetation patterns to soil chemistry and horizon characteristics recorded in Block 4.

## ECOTRON soil site (Block 4)
- ECOTRON plot soil chemistry: Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- ECOTRON vegetation survey data provided in the same framework as other plots, allowing controlled perturbation comparisons with the main Sourhope blocks.

## Block 5 context (siteDetails and profiles)
- Site details for Block 5:
  - Grid reference: NT8544019520; Altitude: 315 m; Slope: 5°; Soil drainage: Imperfect.
  - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous/andesite.
- Soil profile (Block 5):
  - Horizons LF (0–1 cm) to Cg (70–100 cm) with descriptions consistent with oxidic to gleyed horizons, including Ah and AB horizons beneath FH and H horizons.
  - Ah horizons are organic-rich (e.g., Ah %N ~0.65–0.65; %C up to ~9–10%; C:N ~14–15) and contain substantial igneous stones.
  - Surface horizons show higher Ca and Mg in some cases; pH generally acidic; LOI values indicate organic matter content.
- Auger samples (Block 5):
  - Samples 5A–5F show %N ~0.53–0.62, %C ~7–9%, C:N ~10–15, Ca ~1.0–5.1 meq/100 g, Mg ~0.6–3.5 meq/100 g, pH(H2O) ~4.3–4.9, pH(CaCl2) ~3.5–4.4.
  - LOI and moisture loss values contribute to assessing organic content and moisture regimes across blocks.
- Vegetation survey (Block 5):
  - Plot-level data (5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F) include subplots with species totals and distribution patterns, enabling comparison of plant communities across Block 5 microhabitats.

## Data accessibility, provenance, and formats
- Sample provenance and traceability:
  - MLURI Barcodes linked to horizon and auger samples to support repeatability and archival tracking.
- Data formats and outputs:
  - Horizon data sheets, auger sample data, and vegetation tallies prepared for integration with data analysis workflows (e.g., descriptive summaries, multivariate classifications, and cross-plot comparisons).
  - Appendices and data sheets accompany the dataset (e.g., horizon-level data, auger-sample sheets, and vegetation tallies) to support reproducible analyses.
- Context within a long-term monitoring framework:
  - Part of Sourhope field data within ECN networks and related projects; designed to support long-term grassland soil biodiversity studies and cross-plot modeling.

## Key observations for data use
- Soils across Blocks 4 and 5 are acidic with substantial organic-rich upper horizons and variable moisture storage; near-surface horizons are richer in Ca/Mg and LOI, while deeper horizons show reduced exchangeable cations.
- Vegetation data are structured to enable linking species assemblages to detailed horizon chemistry and physical properties, supporting self-serve data exploration and dashboard-style analyses.
- The dataset provides robust baselines for perturbation studies (lime, nitrogen, biocides) and for integrating soil chemistry with vegetation dynamics over time.

## End-user value and potential uses
- Supports cross-plot biodiversity and soil-chemistry analyses within the Sourhope site and with ECN Micronet data.
- Enables development of data products such as dashboards and reports that relate horizon chemistry, soil physics, and vegetation composition to environmental perturbations and management actions.
- Provides a traceable, well-documented data backbone (with barcodes and plot-specific records) suitable for policy discussions, land-management planning, and long-term ecological research.
