  - Depths show progressive reduction in organic matter and changes in structure with finer to coarser horizons.
  - Stone content (igneous) is common, affecting texture and root penetration.
- Vegetation data (Block 4 plots 4A–4F) indicate dominance by grasses such as Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, and Nardus stricta, with Poa pratensis and various forbs contributing to site diversity. Plot-level inventories show varying species richness and indicator assemblages across plots.

- Soil chemistry and properties (selected horizon values):
  - %N: horizon values range from ~0.65% (Ah) to ~2.17% (H); %C: Ah often high (up to ~9–33% in some horizons), other horizons around 30–34% in surface; C:N ratios typically 10–16 in upper horizons, higher in deeper horizons.
  - Ca (meq/100 g): surface horizons ~2–12 meq/100 g; deeper horizons variable, with low Ca in some subhorizons (Bg/BCg) and higher Ca in surface layers.
  - Na, K, Mg: water-extractable cations show typical upland soil patterns with low to moderate base cations; K often in the 0.5–1.0 meq/100 g range in several horizons; Mg ranges ~0.5–5.9 meq/100 g.
  - %Moisture loss and LOI: LOI values across horizons ~14–67% depending on horizon; moisture loss ~4–9% in many horizons; indicates substantial organic matter and mineral contributions in Ah and AB horizons.
  - pH: pH(H2O) typically 4.3–5.2; pH(CaCl2) approximately 3.5–4.4, reflecting strongly acidic conditions.
- Vegetation data (BLOCK 5, plots 5A–5F) show diverse assemblages with grasses, herbs, and forbs; plot-level tallies indicate variable presence of indicator species across subplots, consistent with a mosaic of upland grassland communities.

## Data scope, patterns, and analytical relevance

- The dataset provides a robust, multi-faceted basis for linking soil properties with vegetation communities in upland Sourhope grasslands.
- Dominant vegetation across blocks aligns with NVC classifications typical for acidic upland grasslands (primarily U4d with occasional U5b on moister upper slopes); bryophyte and forb components add subcommunity nuance.
- Strong correlations exist between soil organic matter, moisture, and cation chemistry (Ca, Mg, K) with horizon depth and landform, underpinning nutrient availability and vegetation patterns.
- Block-level differences (4 and 5) reflect variation in drainage, parent material, and horizon development, which influence both soil chemistry and plant community structure.
- The sampling design includes horizon-focused soil chemistry, soil profile descriptions, auger samples, and targeted vegetation surveys, with archival storage and metadata for long-term data discovery and reuse.
- Limitations:
  - Vegetation and soil sampling are partial snapshots within each block (not necessarily exhaustive for every subplot), so results are indicative rather than fully exhaustive of all plots.
  - Some horizons contain substantial igneous stone content that may influence bulk density and root penetration, complicating direct soil-plant comparisons without accounting for texture/stoniness.

## Data management and accessibility

- Archival samples are stored at -80°C; datasets are organized with horizon-level data, plot-level vegetation counts, and site metadata.
- Metadata accompany the soil and vegetation data, supporting discoverability and re-use, including grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, horizon descriptions, and lab measurements.
