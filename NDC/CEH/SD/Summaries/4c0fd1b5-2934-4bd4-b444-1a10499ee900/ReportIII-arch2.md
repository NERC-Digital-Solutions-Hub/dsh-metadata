# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Context and aims
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for more detailed groups, enabling year-to-year comparisons and links to other data.
- Monitoring data intended to be standardized, quality assured, and stored in appropriate data portals, supporting assessment of environmental health and policy-related outputs over time.

## Methods and data monitored
- Key monitoring areas: Automatic Weather Station data; above-ground biomass; soil pH; botanical (plant) composition via Point Analysis.
- Experimental design and management described in Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998); Table 1 lists types and dates of measurements.
- Field activities 1998–2001 included mowing, biomass sampling, soil sampling, and botanical surveys; use of standardized plots and subplots for treatment comparisons.
- Note on 2001 disruptions: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited site access Feb–May 2001; subsequent sampling followed a joint timetable with vet oversight and site protocol.
- Data quality checks included cross-surveyor consistency (two surveyors with similar results) and multivariate analyses (PCA) to interpret vegetation shifts.

## 2001 results highlights

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after very wet 2000.
- Radiation roughly unchanged; average temperatures slightly reduced; soil moisture modestly higher than in prior years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear hierarchical biomass response to treatments; peak biomass typically in July–August.
- 2001 biomass estimates increased substantially relative to previous years; possible explanations include a change in personnel and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- When normalised to a reference plot (C1), nitrogen and/or lime treatments showed the strongest positive impact on productivity.
- ANOVA results (log-transformed biomass) indicate significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots, significant year-by-treatment interaction, and no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime additions continued to raise surface soil pH (0–5 cm): ~6.19 in limed plots, ~6.38 in nitrogen-and-lime plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent; control plots showed little change since baseline (Aug 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis matched July 2000 protocol; high data reliability with no significant inter-surveyor difference.
- 2001 saw 58% more total hits than 2000, suggesting a denser sward (potentially due to reduced grazing since 1998).
- Treatment effects on species composition:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments in 2001.
  - Festuca species (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in nitrogen and/or lime plots (e.g., Festuca rubra in N&L).
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more prevalent in fertilised plots.
  - Untreated/unimproved plots preserved bryophyte-associated and less fertile species (e.g., Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
  - Diversity: unimproved plots contained 24 species vs 18 in the Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting possible diversity decline with greater fertility.
- Multivariate analysis:
  - PCA separated plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime from control/biocide plots.
  - Biomass and species abundances showed positive relationships for Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis with higher biomass; other species (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes) tended to decline as biomass increased.
  - Increased litter in N and/or lime plots indicated faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site heterogeneity
- Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition across site columns; suspected spatial heterogeneity with some columns (e.g., E and F) harboring more acidic plots, especially among nitrogen/limed plots.
- Biomass variation showed outliers with lower yields, while central plots tended to have higher biomass.
- There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant block-level differences detected.

## Data quality and interpretation notes
- Consistent methodology across years facilitates cross-year comparisons and linkage of outputs to standard environmental indicators.
- Observed 2001 disruptions due to FMD were managed via protocol-driven sampling, but some management activities (e.g., first biocide application) were affected.
- The document places emphasis on the relationship between management treatments, soil chemistry (pH), vegetation structure (biomass), and species composition, using standard statistical approaches (ANOVA, PCA).
