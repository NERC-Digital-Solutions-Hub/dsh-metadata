# RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- A NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) monitored weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition across a nutrient-lertiliser-biocide treatment matrix (including control plots) from 1999–2001.
- The study faced two management impacts in 2001: government-imposed restrictions during the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak limiting site access, and a change of Officer in Charge.
- A baseline document (Baseline Data Survey, Nov 1998) underpins design and comparisons; data collection followed a standardized protocol to support cross-year analyses and inter-group comparisons.

## Data and measurements

- Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 headline weather data broadly unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average (839 mm in 2001 after very wet 2000); radiation similar; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture marginally higher than previous years.

- Above-ground biomass
  - Treatments showed a consistent hierarchy of biomass, with peak production in July/August each year.
  - 2001 saw a substantial biomass increase versus earlier years, attributed to staff changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass analyses (normalized to C1) indicated significant differences between improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) and unimproved plots; significant year-by-treatment interactions; no significant block effects.
  - Across years, nitrogen and lime tended to promote biomass, with the strongest response in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.

- Soil pH
  - Lime addition raised topsoil pH (0–5 cm) to about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen-plus-lime plots by October 2001.
  - Nitrogen alone also raised pH to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots remained near baseline pH (as of August 1998).

- Botanical composition
  - Point Quadrat surveys in July 2001 showed a 58% increase in total hits compared with 2000, indicating denser swards, likely from reduced grazing since 1998.
  - Treatment differences emerged in the abundance of key species: Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased across treatments, especially Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina in fertilised plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed greater presence of Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, and Holcus mollis, whereas unimproved plots trended toward species like Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta.
  - Species richness was higher in unimproved treatments (24 species) compared with nitrogen-plus-lime plots (18 species), suggesting a possible decline in diversity with higher fertility.
  - Principal Components Analysis separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; abundance shifts correlated with biomass (e.g., higher Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis with higher biomass).

## Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns

- Variation in surface soil pH and plant community
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F showed more acidic conditions, potentially influenced by plot composition (more Controls or Biocide plots in those columns).
- Variation in vegetation biomass
  - Some plots consistently showed lower biomass (outliers), while central plots tended to have higher biomass across treatments.
  - There was a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, indicating fertility-related growth responses; no significant differences in biomass between blocks.

## Data collection methods and scheduling

- Measurement schedule
  - Detailed data collection across 1998–2001, including soil sampling, biomass harvests (May–Sept), and multiple mowing events.
  - Botanical surveys included full 0.5 m2 quadrat sampling with a Point Quadrat frame (100 cells) and subsequent species tallies.
  - Additional targeted surveys included minirhizotron-related assessments and disturbance/nutrient interaction plots (various subplots and projects).
- Data management
  - Automatic weather data routed to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at CEH Merlewood.
  - Plant species codes (Ac, Ao, Av, Cp, Cx, Cip, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hl, Hm, Liv, Ll, Lm, Lp, Ls, Mc, Ns, Pa, Pp, Pt, Rr, Ra, Rs, Tr, Vm, Vc) and other species observed listed to support reproducibility.
- Analyses
  - Biomass data were ln-transformed and analysed with split-plot ANOVA to assess treatment and year effects.
  - Multivariate analyses (PCA) used to explore shifts in plant community composition.
  - Correlations drawn between species abundance and above-ground biomass to interpret productivity drivers.

## Implications for data strategy and governance (from this study)

- Value of longitudinal, standardized data
  - The design enabled cross-year comparisons and links between soil fertility, biomass production, and plant community shifts, illustrating the value of consistent data collection protocols and documentation.
- Data quality and comparability
  - Normalization to a control (C1) and explicit transformations (ln) supported robust comparisons across years and treatments.
  - The demonstrated link between management actions (nitrogen, lime) and measurable outcomes (biomass, pH, species shifts) underscores the importance of recording management changes for data interpretation.
- Metadata and accessibility
  - Comprehensive metadata (measurement timings, soil depth, species codes) facilitated interpretation and reproducibility.
  - Weather data management and cross-project data sharing through a central data manager highlight the importance of data stewardship and centralized governance, especially under external disruptions.
- Risks to data continuity and comparability
  - FMD-related access restrictions and changes in site management introduced potential biases and data gaps; contingency measures and protocol adherence were necessary to maintain data integrity.
- Lessons for data systems
  - The project demonstrates the importance of documenting provenance, standard operating procedures, and cross-year comparability to support data-driven insights in complex, multi-treatment field experiments.
  - The integration of univariate (biomass, pH) and multivariate (species composition, PCA) analyses provides a roadmap for comprehensive data storytelling that links agronomic/fertility treatments to ecological outcomes.
