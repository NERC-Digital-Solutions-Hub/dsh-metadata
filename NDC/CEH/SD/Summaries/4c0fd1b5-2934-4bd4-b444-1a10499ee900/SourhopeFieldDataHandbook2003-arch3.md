# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Long-term soil-plant monitoring site at Sourhope (Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003) with detailed soil profiles, chemical analyses, and vegetation surveys designed to track environmental health and inform policy decisions.
- Integrates with ECN (Environment Change Network) and Micronet frameworks to enable cross-site comparisons and identification of environmental drivers.
- Data are organized around block-level soil profiles, horizon-by-horizon soil descriptions, core and auger samples, and plot-level vegetation surveys, with associated metadata and barcodes to support traceability, archiving, and longitudinal analyses.

## Data Components and Structure

- Block 4: Soil profile (Rigg Foot, Sourhope)
  - Depths and horizons: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm)
  - Soil descriptions: fibrous, moist; horizons with varying texture, colour (e.g., black Ah, pinkish grey Abg), structure, root abundance, and boundary types.
  - Soil analysis (profile): measured values across horizons for N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2), with horizon-specific results and barcodes.
  - Auger samples: complementary N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH data across multiple auger depths.
  - Vegetation survey: plot- and subplot-level species counts and totals; detailed subplot data (e.g., Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, etc.) across plots 4A–4F, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F.
- Block 5: Soil profile (Rigg Foot, Sourhope)
  - Depths and horizons: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm)
  - Soil descriptions: fibrous and semi-fibrous textures; detailed horizon colour, structure, roots, and presence of igneous stones; boundary descriptions.
  - Soil analysis (profile): horizon-by-horizon values for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH H2O, pH CaCl2 (for each horizon  FH–Cg).
  - Auger samples: auger data for 5A–5F with N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Vegetation survey: subplot and plot totals for 5A–5F with per-subplot species counts and totals (e.g., Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc).
- ECOTRON SOIL SITE
  - ECOTRON PLOT: soil analysis (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2) for ECOTRON plot horizon 1; context for Wright et al. style long-term monitoring.
  - Vegetation survey: plot-level counts for Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, P, with species totals per subplot.
- ECOTRON PLOT (VEGETATION)
  - Detailed subplot and plot tallies across Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, P, with per-subplot totals.
- ECOTRON SITE (SOIL)
  - Soil analysis for ECOTRON plot showing Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.

## Key Variables and Measurements

- Soil chemistry (horizons and auger samples): %N, %C, C:N ratio; cations Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g); %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition; pH in water and CaCl2; horizon-level variations and depth-dependent trends.
- Soil physical descriptors: horizon classifications, colour, texture (e.g., sandy silt loam, clay loam), structure (blocky, granular), presence of roots, mottling, moisture status.
- Vegetation data: presence/absence and abundance indicators across multiple subplots; species inventories and totals per plot/subplot; indicator and co-occurrence patterns embedded in the data.
- Metadata and traceability: MLURI barcodes for each horizon/soil sample and auger sample; grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material, and rock type; horizon labels (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.); block/plot identifiers enabling longitudinal tracking.

## Metadata, Archiving, and Data Management

- Rich site metadata: precise grid references, altitude, slope, drainage status, soil series, parent material, and rock types; horizon-by-horizon soil descriptions with depth ranges.
- Sample tracking: consistent use of MLURI barcodes for all horizons and auger samples; detailed labeling for each sample and sub-sample; archive-ready data structure for long-term monitoring.
- Data accessibility and interoperability: results and data tables prepared to support cross-site comparability within ECN and Micronet frameworks; emphasis on standardized methods and metadata to enable replication and future integration.

## Implications for Monitoring Framework Design

- Depth- and horizon-level data: the dataset demonstrates the value of recording horizon-specific soil descriptions and chemistry to understand vertical profiles and link to vegetation.
- Multi-block and micro-site representation: data show spatial heterogeneity (slope position, moisture gradients) that should be captured via stratified sampling and adequate replication.
- Harmonized data products: alignment with established soil classifications (e.g., NVC-like associations) and multivariate analyses supports cross-site benchmarking and trend detection over time.
- Data governance and openness: extensive metadata, archiving, and provenance information provide a strong basis for data quality assurance, provenance tracking, and transparent sharing within monitoring frameworks.
- Practical considerations: document sampling coverage and limitations (e.g., subset sampling in early years), and ensure consistent horizon labeling and boundary definitions to maintain longitudinal comparability.

## Data Products and References

- Horizon- and plot-level tables and appendices (e.g., Tables/Appendices corresponding to Block 4, Block 5, and ECOTRON data) provide detailed chemical, physical, and vegetation measurements.
- Baseline site details and long-form soil/vegetation descriptions support replication, future monitoring, and cross-site analyses within ECN and Micronet frameworks.
