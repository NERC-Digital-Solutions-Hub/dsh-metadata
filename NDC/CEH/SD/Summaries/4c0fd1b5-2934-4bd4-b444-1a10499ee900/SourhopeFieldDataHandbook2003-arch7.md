# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- This excerpt provides detailed soil and vegetation data for Sourhope, focusing on Blocks 4 and 5, plus an Ecotron plot.
- Data types include auger-sample soil chemistry, soil profile descriptions, horizon-specific analyses, vegetation survey results by plot/subplot, and site metadata.
- Measurements cover nutrient content (N, C, Ca, Mg, K, Na), carbon/nitrogen ratios, organic matter indicators (LOI), moisture loss, pH (H2O and CaCl2), and sample mass.
- Data are organized by block and plot, with associated MLURI barcodes and horizon-depth descriptions, enabling GIS-ready map layers and long-term ecological analyses.

## Block 4 Auger Samples (Soil Chemistry)
- Samples: 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F.
- Measured variables (per sample): Weight (mg), %N, %C, C:N, Ca (meq/100g), Na (meq/100g), K (meq/100g), Mg (meq/100g), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Observations: consistent %N and %C values across samples; Ca generally near 1–3 meq/100g with variability; pH values range around 4.5–4.8 in H2O, slightly higher in CaCl2 scenarios; moisture loss and LOI indicate organic-rich surface horizons varying by sample.

## Block 4 Vegetation Survey
- Plots: 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F with subplot-level data.
- Data types: species presence/absence and totals per subplot, with per-plot species totals.
- Notable patterns: data capture per subplot, enabling assessment of vegetation composition differences across micro-sites within Block 4.

## Block 5 Soil and Vegetation Data
- Site description: Block 5 with horizon-based soil profile and auger sampling (5A–5F).
- Soil profile data (Block 5): Detailed horizon descriptions and depths for FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; includes color, structure, root presence, and boundary characteristics.
- Auger sample analyses (5A–5F): Wt (mg), %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Vegetation data (Block 5): Plot-level and subplot-level data (5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F) with presence/absence totals, and species totals per subplot; numbers indicate diverse vegetation assemblages with varying species counts across subplots.

## ECOTRON PLOT
- Soils: Auger-sample-based analyses (ECOTRON PLOT 1) including Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Vegetation: Survey data by subplots (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, P, etc.), indicating presence and counts for various taxa within the ecotron unit.

## GIS-ready Data Layers and Mapping Implications
- Soil Layers
  - Horizon-based soil properties (pH, %N, %C, C:N, LOI/Moisture loss, Ca, Mg, K, Na) by plot (4A–4F, 5A–5F) and by horizon depth.
  - Horizon descriptions (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) enabling soil-type and drainage mapping (e.g., gleying features in certain blocks).
- Vegetation Layers
  - Plot- and subplot-level vegetation presence/absence and totals; horizon- or plot-level community indicators (e.g., dominant taxa across blocks).
- Data Layers on Management
  - Block/Plot treatments and grazing exclusions (where applicable) for Linkage to nutrient and disturbance experiments.
- Spatial Context
  - Block 4 and Block 5 layouts with detailed subplot grids support fine-scale spatial analyses and interpolation to block-scale maps.
- Quality Notes for GIS
  - Data completeness varies by block and plot; some horizons and samples may be missing or partial.
  - Horizon descriptions and core sampling density suggest caution when interpolating to fine resolution; use block- and horizon-level QA/QC where aggregating.

## Data Quality and Limitations
- Sampling coverage is variable, with partial subplot data and some missing values across blocks.
- Horizon-based data provide rich qualitative descriptions but may require careful standardization when used across blocks for cross-site comparisons.
- Some CaCl2 pH measurements include conventions (e.g., 5 g) that should be consistently applied in analyses.
- Anomalies in Block 4 and Block 5 datasets require cautious interpretation when aggregating or modeling soil-vegetation relationships.

## Practical Applications and Uses
- Baseline GIS layers for soil chemistry, horizon depth, and vegetation composition to monitor long-term changes under experimental treatments.
- Calibration datasets for models of upland grassland responses to nutrient inputs, liming, biocides, and disturbance.
- Integration with long-term Sourhope site networks (ECON/Micronet) for broader ecological and biogeochemical analyses.
- Facilitates site-specific decision support for land management and conservation planning within a mapped framework.

## Key Takeaways
- The data deliver a multi-block, horizon-aware view of soil chemistry and vegetation at Sourhope, with explicit Block 4 and Block 5 auger samples, horizon descriptions, and ecotron units.
- Vegetation and soil data are organized to support GIS-based mapping of communities, soil properties, and management impacts, though users should account for incomplete sampling in some blocks.
- The compiled datasets underpin long-term analyses of soil-vegetation interactions under experimental perturbations and provide a robust baseline for temporal comparisons.
