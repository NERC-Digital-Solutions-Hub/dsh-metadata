# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Macaulay Institute, Scottish Borders.
- Purpose: provide a broad monitoring context for other studies, enable year-to-year comparisons, and link site data to broader environmental health assessments.

## Monitoring measures and data collected
- Automatic Weather Station: headline measures (rainfall, radiation, temperature, soil moisture) collected 1999–2001; data downloaded and used for context.
- Above-ground biomass: annual estimates from five mowing occasions per summer (1999–2001); 0.5 m2 subplots; biomass dried and summed; data log-transformed for analyses.
- Soil pH: measurements of upper 5 cm; lime and nitrogen (N) effects on pH tracked over time.
- Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys in July 2001 (mirroring 2000 protocol); species hits recorded by plot; surveyors' results checked for consistency.
- Data management and protocols: detailed measurement schedule; data prepared for cross-year comparisons; integration with broader datasets (e.g., biomass vs species abundance).

## Key findings by measure
- Weather (2001): rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to previous years; slightly cooler air temperatures; higher soil moisture.
- Above-ground biomass: clear treatment hierarchy; nitrogen and/or lime increased biomass; peak production in July/August; 2001 biomass higher than earlier years, likely due to personnel change and shift from manual to mechanical cutting; biomass normalized to C1 maintained positive effects of N and lime.
- Soil pH: lime raised pH significantly (approx. 6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots); nitrogen alone raised pH modestly; controls remained near baseline since 1998.
- Botanical composition: 2001 survey showed 58% more total hits than 2000; Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments; Festuca spp. and Poa pratensis increased, especially in fertilized plots; biodiversity (species richness) tended to decline in the most improved plots (24 unimproved species vs 18 in improved plots); PCA separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from controls/biocide plots.
- Biomass and species relationships: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta declined as biomass increased; increased litter frequency associated with higher soil fertility, indicating faster vegetation turnover under fertility enhancements.

## Site heterogeneity and implications for interpretation
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: more acidic plots (columns E and F) associated with nitrogen and/or lime treatments; underlying spatial pattern influences pH and flora.
- Biomass distribution: higher biomass in central plots; positive correlation between surface pH and biomass.
- Statistical controls: no significant block effects detected; site heterogeneity underscores the need to account for spatial structure in analyses.

## Management, data quality, and governance notes
- Management disruptions: 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited site access; adjustments to sampling schedule; one biocide application missed in May 2001.
- Personnel changes: change in Officer in Charge; potential impact on measurements (notably biomass due to switch from manual to mechanical cutting).
- Data processing and quality: use of ln-transformed biomass; cross-year comparability between 2000 and 2001 Point Quadrat surveys; inter-surveyor consistency confirmed (no significant difference).
- Metadata and governance: robust documentation of measurement protocols and schedules; findings emphasize the importance of metadata quality and governance for long-term monitoring and data sharing.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a multi-indicator monitoring approach combining biophysical (biomass, soil pH, weather) and biodiversity (species composition) metrics.
- Highlights importance of accounting for site heterogeneity and methodological changes (e.g., cutting techniques) in interpreting treatment effects.
- Shows value of combining traditional statistics (ANOVA) with multivariate analyses (PCA) to detect treatment-driven ecological shifts.
- Underlines the need for robust data governance and metadata practices, especially in long-term monitoring with operational disruptions.
