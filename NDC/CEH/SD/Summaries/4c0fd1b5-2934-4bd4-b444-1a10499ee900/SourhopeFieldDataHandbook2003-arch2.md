# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Purpose
  - Documents long-term, site-based soil and vegetation data from Sourhope to monitor environmental health and inform management/policy in upland grasslands.
  - Emphasises standardized collection, verification, quality assurance, archiving, and data accessibility to support scrutiny of ecological change over time.

- Context of the data in this excerpt
  - Focused presentation of Block 4 and Block 5 data, including soil auger analyses, horizon-based soil profiles, vegetation surveys, and ancillary ecotron plot measurements.
  - Data are tied to ECN/MACAULAY/MLURI frameworks with unique MLURI barcodes for traceability and long-term storage.

- Data types included
  - Soil analysis (auger samples): weight, %N, %C, C:N ratio, extractable cations (Ca, Na, K, Mg), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (water and CaCl2), and related soil properties.
  - Vegetation surveys: species presence/absence (and inferred abundance) within plots; plots organized by subplot; species totals per plot; major grasses and indicator species identified.
  - Soil profiles (Block 5): horizon descriptions (e.g., Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with detailed physical and chemical descriptions.
  - Ecotron plot data: integrated soil and vegetation measurements for controlled-environment study plots.

- Data management and accessibility
  - Data archived with MLURI and ECN channels; barcodes and per-plot, per-horizon organization enable replication and cross-site comparability.
  - Apparent data quality considerations noted (block- and horizon-level anomalies; opportunities for cross-checking with other blocks or timepoints).

- Key findings and patterns (as presented in the excerpt)
  - Block 4 soil (auger samples 4A–4F)
    - %N generally ~0.51–0.58; %C ~6.8–8.02; C:N ratios ~12.6–14.3.
    - Ca.meq/100g ~1.0–2.96; Mg.meq/100g ~0.58–1.59; K.meq/100g ~0.61–0.81; Na.meq/100g ~0.12–0.15.
    - Moisture loss ~4.29–5.15%; LOI ~14.6–17.96%; pH(H2O) ~4.45–4.82; pH(CaCl2) ~3.64–4.05.
    - Vegetation: plots show dominance by upland grasses such as Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta, and Anthoxanthum odoratum, with 25 observed species across plots and higher species richness downslope; NVC alignment commonly with U4d grassland communities; indicator species include F. ovina, Rhytidiadelphus mosses, and other moisture-gradient associations.
  - Block 5 soils and auger samples
    - Detailed horizon data across FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg horizons, with sample-specific values for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, pH, LOI, and moisture loss.
    - Block 5 profile descriptions show a sequence from organic-rich Ah-AB zones to deeper, more strongly mottled B and C horizons with clay loams and mottling, reflecting a Brown Forest soil with gleying tendency.
    - Block 5 auger samples show horizon-specific variability in nutrients (e.g., Ca ranging from low in surface AB to higher in BCg/Cg in some horizons), C and N contents with horizon-depth trends, and pH values in the acidic range (H2O ~4.3–5.2; CaCl2 ~3.5–4.5 depending on horizon).
    - Vegetation surveys (Block 5) illustrate species totals and per-subplot species presence, highlighting gradient patterns in plant communities aligned with moisture and soil texture variations.
  - Block 5 profiles (detailed)
    - FH (fell horizon), H (humic horizon), Ah (A horizon with organic-rich topsoil), AB, Bg, BCg, Cg horizons with descriptive textures and notable stone content; elemental data show horizon-specific shifts in C, N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, moisture, LOI, and pH.
  - Ecotron plot
    - Soil analysis indicates typical upland soil chemistry and acidity within a controlled environment setting; vegetation surveys reflect limited to moderate species presence consistent with experimental design.

- Implications for environmental analysis
  - Demonstrates the value of standardized, multi-layer data (soil chemistry, horizon profiles, and vegetation surveys) for tracking environmental health and responses to management (nutrient inputs, liming, disturbance) over time.
  - Provides a framework for linking soil properties (nutrients, pH, organic content) with plant community structure and organismal interactions in hill grasslands.
  - Highlights data quality considerations and the need for cross-block comparability to strengthen long-term monitoring and policy-relevant assessments.

- Appendices and data resources
  - Site details, soil profiles, horizon-by-horizon chemistry, and vegetation data organized by block and plot (including per-horizon tables and block-level summaries).
  - Example data resources include MLURI barcodes (e.g., 603930–603963 for Block 5 analyses and Block 4 auger samples), with corresponding weights, chemical metrics, and pH measurements.
  - Functionality supports replication, cross-site comparisons, and integration into broader environmental-monitoring initiatives.
