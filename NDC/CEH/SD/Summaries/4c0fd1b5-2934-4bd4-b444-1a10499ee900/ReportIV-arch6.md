# SUMMARY

- Overview
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders), focusing on above-ground biomass production (productivity), plant species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) in a large field experiment.
  - Three main management processes drive botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and soil insecticide application; potential interaction with trampling pulses in 2002.

- Site, design, and data collection
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots with random treatment allocation.
  - Plot-level treatments (applied since 1999): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide (Dursban 4).
  - Management actions: monthly mowing to ~6 cm from May–September; insecticide applied after mowing; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime on designated plots.
  - Data collected:
    - Weather: continuous on-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999.
    - Above-ground productivity: annual biomass estimates from random 0.5 m2 cells per sub-plot; clippings dried and weighed.
    - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998 survey; annual/seasonal point analysis (2000, 2001, 2002) using 0.5 m2 cells with a 100-hole grid; bryophyte identification improved in 2002.
    - Soils: pH (0–5 cm depth) measured yearly; soil moisture in corners of point-analysis cells in 2002.
    - Additional small-scale surveys and species inventories; Appendix 3 provides a full species list.
  - Data management notes:
    - 2002 weather data included missing periods due to a weather-station malfunction; where needed, data from a nearby station (Konza) substituted for July–November periods.
    - Data across years used 1999–2002 for biomass comparisons and longer-term trends (1999–2002).

- Data analyses and products
  - Statistical approaches: split-plot ANOVA (treatment, year, and interactions) on ln-transformed biomass; PCA on point-analysis data with treatment-ranked inputs; calculation of Shannon diversity indices from point analyses.
  - Key data outputs:
    - Time-series biomass by treatment and year, including normalization against a Control 1 baseline.
    - Treatment-specific shifts in functional plant groups (based on CSR framework): stress tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (C-S-R), and SR/C-S-R combinations.
    - Relative abundance of key species (e.g., Festuca spp., Agrostis spp., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) across treatments from point analyses.
    - Bryophyte dynamics (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) and litter prevalence over time.
    - Relationships among soil pH, soil moisture, and above-ground productivity, including treatment-level nuances.
  - Notable patterns across analyses: improved vs unimproved plots separate in ordination; lime-treated plots cluster together; some nitrogen-treated plots align with limed plots; present evidence for treatment-by-year interactions.

- Main findings by management theme
  - Mowing effect
    - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline by about 40% since 2000 across most treatments, suggesting a site-level response to mowing rather than treatment-specific effects.
    - Festuca rubra expands, particularly in fertile plots (associated with lime and/or nitrogen); bryophytes (mosses) expand across the site, aided by the ~6 cm sward height and absence of grazing.
    - Moss expansion is linked to reduced disturbance and may dampen vascular plant diversity in less fertile plots.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently boost above-ground biomass; plots receiving both nitrogen and lime show the strongest productivity, though signs emerge that yield may have peaked in the highest-fertility plots (possibly due to very high soil pH ~7.0 and lower soil moisture).
    - Lime raises soil pH substantially; high pH interacts with moisture to influence productivity. In plots with both nitrogen and lime, the positive pH effect is pronounced but the biomass–pH relationship is complex and treatment-dependent.
    - Functional group shift: C-S-R species expand in N&L plots, while stress-tolerant species gain in unfertilised plots.
  - Insecticide effect
    - Shannon diversity tends to be higher in insecticide-treated plots, consistent with hypotheses that herbivore suppression can alter plant community structure.
    - The relationship between insecticide use and diversity is discussed with caution due to uncertainty about direct causal links and varying insect-control efficacies; results align with prior work suggesting complex plant–insect interactions.
  - Trampling effect
    - In 2002, the newly sampled C2 plots (Control with added trampling context from 13CO2 pulses) show marked productivity reductions, implying trampling-related suppression during intensive experimental activities likely contributed to lower biomass in those plots.
  - Functional plant groups (CSR framework)
    - Across years, unimproved plots favor stress-tolerant (S) species; fertilised plots (N and/or Lime) shift towards more competitive-stress-ruderals (C-S-R) with higher productivity.
    - SR/C-S-R groups decline in lime- and insecticide-treated plots, reflecting changes in disturbance and nutrient regimes.
    - By 2002, distinct treatment differences emerge in all three functional groups, with clear shifts aligned to soil fertility and disturbance conditions.

- 2002 snapshot and longer-term context
  - Biomass productivity in 2002 fell relative to 2001 across several treatments, but a longer-term rise in biomass is observed from 1999 to 2002 when normalized to controls.
  - Block position on the slope influences productivity, with lower blocks (down-slope) sometimes showing greater percentage changes than upper blocks.
  - Point-analysis results show differential abundance of grass species linked to fertility (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in fertilised plots) and declines in Agrostis spp.; bryophyte hits increase across treatments, especially in unimproved plots.
  - Shannon diversity generally increases over time in most treatments except notable declines in the N&L plots relative to baseline; some treatments (notably insecticide) show the strongest positive diversity changes.
  - PCA and species-hits analyses reveal clear separation between improved (fertilised/limed) and unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots forming a distinct cluster.

- Data resources and references
  - Appendices provide detailed data resources: site map and treatments (Appendix 2), species lists (Appendix 3), site activity (Appendix 4), weather data (Appendix 5), biomass data (Appendix 6), biomass rankings (Appendix 7), and species-hits comparisons (Appendix 8). Appendix 3 includes a comprehensive vascular bryophyte list captured in 2002.
  - Principal references underpinning functional-type classifications and relevant ecological context (CSR framework, plant-insect interactions, grazing and mowing effects) are cited throughout.

- Implications for data use
  - The dataset enables longitudinal analysis of how mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide use shape biomass productivity, species composition, bryophyte dynamics, and functional group structure in grassland plant communities.
  - The combination of time-series biomass, detailed point analyses, and CSR-based functional categorisation supports exploration of ecosystem-function linkages under different management regimes.
  - Data quality notes (e.g., 2002 weather-data gaps) should be considered when interpreting year-to-year comparisons, and cross-year normalization against controls improves comparability.
