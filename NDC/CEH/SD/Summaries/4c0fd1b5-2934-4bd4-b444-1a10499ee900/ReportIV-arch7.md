# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report 2002

## Overview
- Four-year summary of the Sourhope field experiment, focusing on above-ground productivity (biomass), plant species composition, and diversity under different management treatments.
- Three major drivers of botanical change identified: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and insecticide use; interactive effects with soil and moisture also explored.
- Emphasis on linking below-ground processes to above-ground plant community responses and functional plant groups.

## Experimental Design and Spatial Context (GIS framing)
- Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Design: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system allocates plots to research groups.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA).
- Site-level management: monthly mowing (May–Sept) to ~6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing on relevant plots.
- Data collection points align with GIS-like grids (sub-plots, cells) enabling spatially explicit analyses.

## Data Collected (Types and Temporal Coverage)
- Climate and weather: continuous on-site Automatic Weather Station data (1999–2002), including rainfall, radiation, and temperature.
- Above-ground biomass: annual biomass estimates from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots, harvested at five summer cuts per year, dried to 80°C, and weighed.
- Botanical surveys:
  - 1998 baseline vegetation survey (point quadrat, 25 points per sub-plot).
  - 2000, 2001, 2002 extensive Point Analysis in 0.5 m2 cells using a 100-hole grid and a pin-down method to record species at each touch point.
  - Bryophyte detail expanded in 2002 (species-level) for some surveys.
- Soil measurements: soil pH (0–5 cm), and soil moisture (theta probe) in 2002; pH measured across all plots (March 2002) and in the botanical survey cells (July/August 2002).
- Additional small-scale surveys: varying plots for cover, biomass sorting by species, and disturbance studies (Appendices 6–8 summarize data).
- Species catalog: Appendix 3 provides a full vascular plant and bryophyte species list observed in 2002.
- Data integration: 11621 soil samples collected since start; multiple appendices organize site activity, weather, biomass, species data, and treatment details.

## Key Analytical Approaches and Findings (GIS-relevant outputs)
- Biomass and treatment effects:
  - Nitrogen and Lime together produce the highest above-ground biomass; unfertilised plots generally lower productivity.
  - 2002 biomass declined from 2001 across most treatments; strongest declines in Control 2 plots; slope position affected productivity (lower on upslope blocks).
  - ANOVA shows significant treatment, year, and treatment×year interactions for biomass.
- Soil–productivity relationships:
  - Lime raises soil pH toward ~7.0; positive relation between higher pH and productivity, though potential moisture limitation and chlorosis observed in lime treatments.
  - Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH; stronger pH–biomass relationship when considering all treatments together than within some treatments.
  - In plots with both nitrogen and lime, higher pH correlates differently with biomass than plots with nitrogen-only or lime-only additions.
- Functional groups and CSR analysis (Grime CSR framework):
  - Treatments shift functional group composition: stress-tolerators flourish in unimproved plots; competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and related SR/CSR groups expand in nitrogen+lime plots.
  - Lime and/or nitrogen treatments reduce SR/CSR representation; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerant types.
- Insecticide effects:
  - Insecticide plots show patterns consistent with increased diversity in some cases, potentially via reduced herbivory enabling more palatable species; however, direct causation remains cautious due to data limitations.
- Trampling effects:
  - First-year C2 (insecticide) plots show reduced productivity linked to intense 13CO2 pulse activities, suggesting trampling effects during peak activity periods.
- Species composition and diversity (Point Analysis and PCA):
  - PCA distinguishes improved (fertilised) vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster with others showing higher fertility signals.
  - Relative abundance shifts: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis more common in fertilised plots; Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp. more common in unimproved plots.
  - Bryophyte expansion (mosses) observed across the site, more pronounced in unimproved plots; bryophytes contribute a growing share of total hits and biomass over time.
  - Shannon Diversity Index: treatment differences emerge in 2000, strengthening in 2001–2002; overall 2002 diversity index shows declines in nitrogen+lime plots relative to baseline, with increases in several other treatments.
- Functional group depth (Appendix 2/9 visuals):
  - Three dominant functional groups (stress tolerators S; competitive-stress-ruderals CSR; SR/CSR) consistently represent the majority of vascular plant hits (69–95% across years); shifts over time reflect treatment effects.

## Practical Implications for GIS and Data Products
- Spatially explicit data framework:
  - Grid-based design (plots, sub-plots, 0.5 m2 cells) supports high-resolution, map-based visualization of biomass, species distribution, and bryophyte encroachment.
  - Ability to map treatment effects, down-slope spatial gradients, and microhabitat variation (soil pH and moisture) across the site.
- Multi-temporal and multi-source data integration:
  - Combines climatology, soil chemistry, vegetation surveys, biomass harvesting, and point analysis data for longitudinal GIS analyses.
  - Data organization through appendices (maps, species lists, weather, biomass, rank data) facilitates reproducible geospatial analyses and visualization.
- Data quality and provenance:
  - Clear documentation of sampling methods, plot layouts, and treatment schedules enables reproducible GIS analytics and overlay with external datasets.
- Potential map-based outputs:
  - Spatial maps of biomass productivity by treatment and year; pH and moisture distribution maps linked to productivity.
  - Species distribution maps showing shifts in Festuca/Festuca rubra, Agrostis spp., bryophytes, and CSR-functional groups.
  - PCA and diversity metric visualizations spatially layered by treatment to identify hotspots or gradients.
  - Temporal change maps highlighting mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide effects on community composition.

## Appendices and Data Resources (GIS-friendly references)
- Appendix 1: Site map showing orientation and plot treatments (useful for GIS layer alignment).
- Appendix 2: Detailed site- and plot-level treatments (nitrogen, lime, insecticide timings and rates).
- Appendix 3: Species lists (vascular plants and bryophytes) observed in 2002.
- Appendix 4–8: Site activity, weather, biomass, rank analyses, and species ranking data (facilitates time-series and multivariate GIS analyses).
- Appendix 5: Automatic Weather Station headline measures (environmental context for spatial climate analyses).

## Endnotes and Context
- The report integrates ecological theory (CSR plant functional types) with empirical measurements to interpret how management regimes reshape plant communities and productivity.
- While some causal links (e.g., insecticide effects on diversity) are cautious due to data limitations, the document provides a rich, geospatially navigable dataset for map-based exploration of treatment effects and spatial patterns over time.
