# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- An intensive field study at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, documenting year-by-year context data to support broader research groups.
- Focus on broad monitoring across weather, biomass production, soil chemistry, and plant community composition to enable comparisons and data linking across years and projects.
- 1999–2001: data collection continued with some management disruptions in 2001 due to Foot and Mouth restrictions and a change of site officer.

## Data Collected and Measurements

- Automatic Weather Station data (1999–2001): headline measures including rainfall, radiation, soil moisture, and average air/soil temperatures.
- Above-ground biomass: annual productivity measured via five summer harvests per year (May–Sept), using 0.5 m² subplots per plot; dried weighed biomass; data normalised to a reference plot (C1) to compare treatment effects across years.
- Soil pH: upper 5 cm soil measured; pH changes tracked over time, including effects of lime and nitrogen additions.
- Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July) to determine species hits per plot; long-term species trends across treatments; PCA used to examine community shifts.
- Experimental design data: treatment matrix across plots including Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Biocide; mowing methods recorded (noting a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001).

## Experimental Design and Management Context

- Treatments and monitoring: six main treatments across plots, with five blocks; data presented per plot and per treatment, plus cross-year comparisons.
- Data handling notes:
  - Biomass data transformed (ln) for ANOVA analyses.
  - Outputs normalised against C1 to identify treatment effects across years.
- Management events affecting data:
  - 2001 FMD restrictions limited site access February–May; subsequent sampling conducted under approved protocols.
  - Change of officer in charge occurred in May 2001.
  - Biocide application in May 2001 was missed, others completed as planned.

## Key Results

- Above-ground biomass (2001):
  - Clear hierarchy of biomass by treatment maintained; 2001 biomass higher than previous years, likely due to personnel changes and the switch to mechanical cutting.
  - Nitrogen and Lime (especially Nitrogen + Lime) most effective at increasing biomass; results consistent with prior year trends.
  - ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant block effects.
- Soil pH:
  - Lime raises pH; October 2001 values: limed plots ~6.19; Nitrogen & Lime plots ~6.38; Nitrogen alone raises pH modestly; Control plots show little change since 1998 baseline.
- Botanical composition:
  - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) vs. 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting reduced diversity with enhanced fertility.
  - 2001 shifts: Agrostis capillaris declines across most treatments; Festuca spp. increase; fertilised plots show more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; Bryophyte-associated species more common in unimproved plots.
  - PCA indicates distinct separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; biomass correlates with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while some grasses and bryophytes decline as biomass increases.
  - Increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots implies faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
- Site heterogeneity:
  - Spatial variation in surface pH and plant composition across columns, with some columns showing more acidic conditions, especially where N and/or Lime treatments are concentrated.
  - Biomass variation shows central plots typically higher in productivity; a strong positive correlation exists between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No significant difference in biomass between blocks overall; some outlier plots show notably low or high biomass across treatments.

## Data Quality and Limitations

- Inter-surveyor reliability is high; no significant difference between surveyors in 2001.
- 2001 disruptions (FMD, officer change, partial missed application) are acknowledged as factors influencing data comparability and management of the field site.
- Data interpretation relies on normalisation to C1 and year-on-year ANOVA to discern true treatment effects amid site heterogeneity.

## Implications for Data Use and Potential Data Products

- Time-series dashboards:
  - Track biomass by treatment (1999–2001) with year-over-year change and normalised values.
  - Overlay soil pH trends by plot/treatment to visualize liming effects.
- Spatial and multivariate products:
  - Plot-level pH and biomass maps to illustrate site heterogeneity and central vs. edge effects.
  - PCA biplots and species abundance heatmaps to explore treatment-driven plant community shifts.
- Data products for end users:
  - Summary tables of biomass, pH, and species hits by treatment and year.
  - Correlation analyses linking biomass with pH, and with key species (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis).
- Data quality notes for reuse:
  - Document year-specific management events (FMD restrictions, mowing method changes) when interpreting cross-year comparisons.
  - Include metadata on surveyors and any deviations in protocols to support reproducibility and cross-study integration.
