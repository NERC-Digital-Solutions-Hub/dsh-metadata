# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- The block provides a detailed soil profile from 0 to 95 cm, with horizon descriptions showing a largely fibrous, organic-rich upper profile transitioning to mineral horizons.
- Key horizons and features:
  - LF (0–1 cm): No mineral grains; fibrous; moist; smooth boundary.
  - FH (1–4 cm): No mineral grains; fibrous; abundant fine roots; sharp boundary.
  - H (4–8 cm): Black, amorphous mineral content; weak blocky structure; dense fibrous roots; boundary.
  - Ah (8–29 cm): Dark reddish brown sandy silt loam; weak to moderate blocky structure; many fine roots; many stones; sharp boundary.
  - Abg (29–40 cm): Pinkish grey with brown mottles; coarse sandy silt loam; mixed mottling; stones present; sharp boundary.
  - B sg (40–61 cm): Brown with mottles; sandy silt loam; blocky to platy structure; stones common; boundary sharp.
  - C gx (61–95 cm): Reddish brown clay loam; massive to platy structure; few roots; many stones.
- Overall soil interpretation: Brown Forest soil with igneous stones; relatively acid to mildly acidic; notable organic enrichment in surface horizons with substantial stone content in subsoil.

## BLOCK 4 Soil Analysis Highlights

- Horizons and sampled sub-sites: FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx; each horizon analyzed for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O), and pH (CaCl2).
- Representative ranges and observations:
  - %N: approximately 0.12 to 2.14 across horizons (surface horizons richer in N).
  - %C: broad range from <1% in mineral horizons to ~38% in surface-organic horizon (FH has very high C, ~38%).
  - C:N: roughly 12 to 20, with surface horizons showing lower C:N due to high carbon content in organic layer.
  - Ca: generally elevated in upper horizons (FH) and variable down the profile.
  - Na, K, Mg: variable; Mg shows some higher values in surface horizons.
  - %Moisture loss and LOI: LOI values range widely, with high organic matter in surface horizons (elevated LOI in FH/H) and substantial values in deeper horizons.
  - pH (H2O): broadly acidic, typical values around 4.5–5.0 in several horizons.
  - pH (CaCl2): slightly more acidic readings, often in the 3.8–4.2 range.
- Notable observations: high organic matter content and carbon in the upper horizons; presence of igneous stones throughout; pH and nutrient patterns reflect acidic Brown Forest soil conditions with variabilities by horizon.

## BLOCK 4 Auger Samples (4A–4F)

- Parameters measured per auger sample: weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Example ranges:
  - %N: ~0.51–0.58
  - %C: ~6.8–8.0
  - C:N: ~12.6–14.3
  - Ca: ~1.0–5.1 meq/100g
  - Mg: ~0.58–3.5 meq/100g
  - K: ~0.58–0.83 meq/100g
  - %Moisture loss: ~4.1–5.2
  - LOI: ~14.6–17.9
  - pH(H2O): ~4.45–4.95
  - pH(CaCl2): ~3.53–4.14
- Interpretation: Auger samples show consistent surface-to-subsoil gradients in nutrients and acidity, with modest organic content and low pH values characteristic of acidic forest soils.

## BLOCK 4 Vegetation Survey (Plot 4A)

- Subplot-level vegetation data captured for plots 4A across multiple subplots (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, etc.) with counts of species totals per subplot.
- Observations: species totals per subplot vary considerably (from single-digit to higher counts), reflecting spatial heterogeneity in vegetation within Block 4 main plot.
- Indication: data support classification of vegetation patterns by subplot and facilitate cross-plot comparisons with other blocks.

## ECOTRON SITE (Block 4)

- Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT): Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76; Na 0.15; K 0.62; Mg 1.7; Moisture loss 4.79; LOI 17.42; pH(H2O) 4.79; pH(CaCl2) 3.82.
- Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT): list of species counts per subplot; overall totals indicate a smaller, separate subplot replicate within the ecotron for controlled environment study.

## DATA GOVERNANCE & METADATA (BLOCK 4)

- Data support: grid-based reference framework, horizon labeling (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.), and a structured set of soil-chemistry and physical properties.
- Repositories and identifiers: MLURI barcodes provided for each horizon and for auger samples, enabling traceability and long-term archiving (e.g., FH 603951; H 603952; Ah 603953; AB 603954; Bg 603961; BCg 603962; Cg 603963; Ecotron 603930).
- Metadata depth: explicit horizon-by-horizon descriptions, sample IDs, and multiple analytical measurements, suitable for cross-block comparisons and inter-site data synthesis.

## BLOCK 5 CONTEXT (summary)

- Site details confirm Block 5 as part of the same Sourhope site with grid reference NT8544019520, about 315 m altitude, 5° slope, imperfect drainage, and Brown Forest soil with gleying.
- Soil profile (0–100 cm): LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg horizons with igneous stone content and clear boundaries; horizon-specific descriptions indicate a progressive depletive/mineralization pattern typical of Brown Forest soils with gley features.
- Soil analyses (Block 5 profile and auger samples 5A–5F): similar variables to Block 4, with pH, LOI, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, Na, K across horizons; higher stone content and persistent acidity noted in subsoil horizons.
- Vegetation surveys (Block 5 plots 5A–5F): detailed subplot-species data showing variable species totals; patterns consistent with block-to-block ecological differences.
- ECOTRON DATA (Block 5): ECOTRON plot soil analysis (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, pH) and vegetation data, enabling controlled comparisons with Block 4 and cross-block synthesis.

## RELEVANCE FOR DATA LEADERS

- Data assets encompass multi-layered soil and vegetation data across Blocks 4 and 5, with thorough horizon-level metadata, enabling long-term biodiversity and soil research.
- Standardized approaches (horizon labeling, soil-chemistry panels, vegetation presence/absence and totals) support cross-site synthesis and alignment with broader ecological data standards.
- Data governance is strengthened by explicit identifiers (MLURI barcodes) and archived samples (e.g., LOI-rich horizons, -80°C storage), supporting reproducibility and future re-analysis.
- The dataset highlights data quality considerations (gaps in Na data in some horizons; block-specific anomalies; sampling variance in vegetation surveys) that data leaders should address to ensure robust cross-block comparisons and reliable network-wide insights.
- Overall, Sourhope Block 4 (and Block 5) provides a scalable, well-documented data platform for ecological monitoring, with potential for integration into ECN/Micronet and other data communities to study soil-vegetation dynamics and responses to management.
