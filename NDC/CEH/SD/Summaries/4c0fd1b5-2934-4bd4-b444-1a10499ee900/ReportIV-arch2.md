# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Overview
  - Four-year update from the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope field site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders).
  - Focus on above-ground productivity, plant community composition, and diversity in response to five main management factors: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), insecticide application, trampling, and control treatments.
  - Emphasis on linking above-ground responses to soil conditions (pH, moisture) and functional plant groups (CSR framework).

- Site management and treatments
  - Site-wide mowing: monthly cuts to ~6 cm from May to September (since 1999).
  - Insecticide treatment: Dursban 4 (chlorpyrifos) applied to designated plots after mowing.
  - Fertility treatments: nitrogen and/or lime applied to plots in spring (two annual doses for nitrogen; lime applied once annually).
  - Plot structure: 5 replicate blocks across a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into sub-plots, with specific treatments randomised.
  - 2002 field activities included major lab-based tracing (e.g., labeled 13CO2 pulses) by CEH researchers.

- Data collection and analysis
  - Weather, soil, and site data collected via on-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999.
  - Above-ground productivity measured by harvesting random 0.5 m2 cells prior to each mow; samples oven-dried and weighed.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline (1998) and annual July/August point analyses using 0.5 m2 cells and 25-point grids; bryophyte identification improved in 2002.
  - Soil monitoring: pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe) measured periodically.
  - Data analyses: biomass ANOVA (split-plot), PCA for species hit data, diversity indices (Shannon), and examination of functional groups (CSR categories).

- Key results
  - Biomass productivity
    - Net increase in biomass across most treatments since 1999, with the strongest gains where nitrogen and lime are combined.
    - 2002 saw a general decline in biomass relative to 2001, with reductions up to ~31% in Control 2 plots; fertility plots maintained higher productivity than unfertilised ones.
    - Spatial pattern: slope position influenced productivity, with lower blocks showing larger declines.
  - Fertilisation effects
    - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently boost productivity; plots with both nitrogen and lime most productive, though signs of potential peak in these plots by 2002.
    - High lime application raised soil pH toward ~7.0, potentially reducing moisture availability and impacting productivity under some conditions.
  - Soil chemistry and productivity
    - Lime strongly increases soil pH; nitrogen has a smaller positive effect on pH.
    - Positive relationship between higher pH and biomass observed overall, but the relationship weakens within singly fertilised plots and may become negative when both N and lime are applied (suggesting a complex pH-moisture-growth interaction).
    - Strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (r ≈ -0.68).
  - Plant functional groups (CSR framework)
    - In unfertilised/un-disturbed plots (unfertilised): stress-tolerant (S) species favored; disturbance reduces but nutrient loss from mowing gradually shifts community.
    - In fertilised plots (N and/or Lime, especially N+L): competitive (C) and stress-ruderal (SR) types become more prevalent; C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups expand, particularly where lime is applied.
    - Lime-only plots show distinct shifts in functional composition compared to other treatments.
  - Insecticide effects
    - Insecticide-treated plots show higher Shannon diversity increases over time compared to some other treatments, though attribution to reduced herbivory is not definitive without further controlled evidence.
    - Hypothesised that reduced herbivory may enable certain palatable species to persist, maintaining higher diversity under infertile conditions.
  - Trampling effect
    - 2002 C2 plots (where trampling from lab activities occurred) show pronounced reductions in productivity, suggesting trampling suppressed vegetation growth in those plots.
  - Plant species composition and diversity
    - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declines (>40% since 2000) across most treatments, potentially due to mowing homogenisation rather than a specific treatment.
    - Festuca rubra expands markedly in fertile plots; Festuca ovina declines; overall Festuca spp. increase linked to lime and nitrogen additions.
    - Bryophytes (mosses) expand across the site, notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus; bryophyte hits rise from 6.5% (2000) to ~20% (2002) overall, especially in unimproved plots.
    - Point Analysis indicates clearer separation of improved vs unimproved plots in 2002; limed plots cluster together; nitrogen-treated plots show mixed affinities with limed plots.
  - Diversity and community structure
    - Shannon diversity indices fall in nitrogen+lime plots by 2002 relative to baseline, whereas other treatments show increases (up to 29% in some insecticide-treated plots).
    - PCA of 2002 point data demonstrates treatment-driven grouping, with bryophytes increasing in unimproved plots and vascular plant responses aligning with fertility gradients.
    - Bryophyte dominance increases overall; monocot hits decline in certain treatments, while dicots and bryophytes fill niches left by reduced dominance of certain grasses.

- End-user implications for monitoring
  - Monitoring demonstrates how management choices (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) drive functional shifts in plant communities and productivity over time.
  - Evidence suggests larger long-term value in datasets when combined with soil chemistry and moisture data to interpret productivity and diversity changes.
  - The project highlights the need to consider both above- and below-ground feedbacks, including soil pH/moisture interactions, in interpreting above-ground responses.

- Appendices and data context
  - Detailed treatment maps, species lists, and methodological appendices accompany the study (e.g., Appendix 2 on treatment specifics; Appendix 5 weather data; Appendix 8 species hit comparisons; Appendix 6 biomass totals; Appendix 8 PCA results).
  - The site maintains extensive historical data (1998–2002) enabling trend analyses and cross-year comparisons across treatments.

- Conclusions relevant to monitoring practice
  - Mowing without grazing promotes stress-tolerant and bryophyte expansion; fertility boosts production but may reduce diversity in high-N and high-lime contexts.
  - Lime-driven pH increases can enhance growth up to a point, after which moisture stress may offset gains.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are complex and may be context-dependent; direct causation to diversity changes remains cautious.
  - Trampling during intensive experimental activities can confound productivity measures and should be accounted for in experimental design.
  - Functional classification (CSR) provides a useful lens for predicting community responses to nutrient, disturbance, and pH changes, aiding interpretation of monitoring data and informing land-management decisions.
