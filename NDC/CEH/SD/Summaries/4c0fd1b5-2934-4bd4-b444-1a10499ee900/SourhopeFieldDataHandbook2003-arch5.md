- Scope and content
  - Detailed soil profile description for Block 4 (Rigg Foot, Sourhope) including horizon sequence and descriptive soil text.
  - Accompanying soil chemistry and physical data across horizons: LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx.
  - Includes auger-sample data (4A–4F) and corresponding horizon-level measurements.
  - Vegetation survey data associated with Block 4 plots.
  - Adds context with Block 5 and ECOTRON data sections for broader site data.

- Horizons and descriptive sequence
  - Horizons and depths (Block 4): LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Soil descriptions emphasize organic-rich, fibrous, moist surface horizons with fine roots; transition to subsoil horizons with loamy textures and increasing stone content; visible mottling and structure changes across horizons.

- Key measurements per horizon
  - Chemical and physical properties tracked: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2), plus moisture-related metrics.
  - Representative values (selected examples):
    - FH: %N 1.88, %C 38.12, C:N 20.24, Ca 10.05 meq/100g, pH(H2O) 4.76, pH(CaCl2) 4.01.
    - Ah: %N 0.42, %C 6.41, C:N 15.30, Ca 0.92 meq/100g, pH(H2O) 4.57, pH(CaCl2) 3.95.
    - C gx: %N 0.02, %C 0.27, C:N 12.43, Ca 0.34 meq/100g, pH(H2O) 5.02, pH(CaCl2) 3.88.
  - Notable patterns include higher C and low N in surface horizons, increasing groundmass carbonate and cation changes with depth, and relatively acidic pH across horizons.

- Auger samples (Block 4)
  - Samples 4A–4F with depth-integrated measures: %N (0.56–0.58), %C (7.00–8.02), C:N ratios (12.62–14.26), Ca (2.96–5.08 meq/100g), Mg (0.58–1.59 meq/100g), %Moisture loss (4.11–5.15), LOI (4.47–17.56), pH(H2O) (4.45–4.82), pH(CaCl2) (3.53–4.09).
  - Range and distribution indicate horizon-to-horizon variability and some block-level differences (e.g., higher Ca in FH and Ah in Block 4 compared to deeper horizons).

- Vegetation data (Block 4)
  - Subplots and species tallies per plot (4A–4F) with counts of indicator species and total species per plot.
  - Data show variable plant community composition across plots, with species totals and presence/absence patterns used to relate vegetation to soil properties.

- Data provenance and storage
  - Tie-ins to specimen identifiers: MLURI Barcodes for horizon-level samples (e.g., FH 603951, H 603952, Ah 603953, AB 603954, Bs 603955, Cx 603956).
  - Weights of samples recorded in mg for each horizon (e.g., FH 5.827 mg, H 5.869 mg, Ah 5.141 mg, etc.).
  - Archiving practices implied (soil samples archived at site with horizon-specific identifiers).

- Block 5 context (summary for continuity with Block 4)
  - Site details and horizon sequence: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Similar suite of measurements as Block 4: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2) across horizons.
  - Auger samples (5A–5F) show horizon-specific chemistry with notable variation in Ca, Mg, and C content; pH values generally acidic to neutral (H2O ~4.5–5.2; CaCl2 ~3.5–4.2).
  - Vegetation data (Plot 5A–5F) and species totals indicate distinct community composition patterns across Block 5 plots.

- ECOTRON PLOT data (supporting site-wide context)
  - Soil analysis: Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59, %C 8.22, C:N 13.83, Ca 2.76, Mg 1.7, pH(H2O) 4.79, pH(CaCl2) 3.82.
  - Vegetation data accompanying the ECOTRON plot with presence/absence and counts of taxa.

- Data quality, limitations, and governance notes relevant to data stewards
  - Coverage and granularity: Vegetation surveys are present but may be incomplete for some subplots; horizon data are rich but block-to-block heterogeneity exists.
  - Metadata and traceability: Horizon identifiers, depths, and barcodes are clearly documented; MLURI barcodes and horizon codes enable traceability and reproducibility.
  - Data formats and interoperability: Datasets include numerous tabular blocks (horizons, auger samples, vegetation plots) and cross-referenced by plot, horizon, and block; legacy formats and varying nomenclature across blocks may require harmonization for cross-site analyses.
  - Archiving and governance: Soil samples archived at -80°C; provenance and horizon-level data captured; intention to upload datasets to portals with appropriate metadata and documentation.

- Governance and program context
  - Data arise from long-term environmental and biodiversity monitoring at Sourhope, linked to ECN and related research programs.
  - Emphasis on data usability with metadata breadth, enabling discovery, reuse, and cross-site comparisons within a broader environmental network.
  - Data handling aligned with centralized stewardship approaches (standardized provenance, documentation of processing/workflows, and cataloging for external access).

- Key takeaways for data stewardship
  - Maintain and harmonize horizon-level metadata: horizon names, depths, texture, colour, structure, and stone content.
  - Preserve horizon-specific chemical and physical data with clear units and lab methods (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, LOI, LOI, pH, moisture loss).
  - Ensure traceability through barcodes and linkage to plot, block, and horizon identifiers; preserve sample weights and analytical indices.
  - Store and document vegetation data alongside soil data to support soil-vegetation–microbe analyses.
  - Address data gaps and variability by capturing meta-notes on sampling coverage and any anomalies across blocks.
