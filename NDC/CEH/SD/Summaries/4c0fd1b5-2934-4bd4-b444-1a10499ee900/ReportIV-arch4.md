# SUMMARY

- Context and scope
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders), focusing on links between soil biodiversity and above-ground plant communities.
  - Long-term, multi-project dataset spanning site management, plant productivity, species composition, and diversity, with attention to below-ground–above-ground feedbacks.

- Data assets and collection framework
  - Site setup and treatments
    - 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
    - Five plot-level treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime; and an Insecticide (biocide) treatment (renamed Insecticide plots in 2002).
    - Site-wide management includes monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept) and insecticide application after mowing; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime on designated plots.
  - Data streams collected (since 1998–1999, with intensive 2000–2002 activity)
    - Above-ground biomass: regular clipping and weighing from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within subplots S, T, U, V; samples dried and weighed.
    - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998; annual July/August point analyses (0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid; 25-point pin-down at each point); bryophyte identification advanced in 2002.
    - Soil and microclimate: soil pH (5 cm depth), soil moisture (theta probe in 2002), and on-site Automatic Weather Station data (1999–2002); some missing data in 2002 due to equipment issues.
    - Species lists and functional groups: vascular plants and bryophytes; CSR functional classification (stress-tolerant, competitive, ruderal) tracked across years.
  - Data volume and access
    - Over 11,600 soil samples collected to date; extensive appendices and species lists accompany the publication.
    - Data and methodological details disseminated through the Soil Biodiversity website and CEH contact points.
  - Data quality and standards
    - Baseline and follow-up surveys standardized (0.5 m2 cells, 25-point quadrats in 1998; 0.5 m2 cells for annual point analyses 2000–2002).
    - Bryophytes identified to species level in 2002; plant functional types assigned (CSR system) to interpret community responses.
    - Statistical analyses include split-plot ANOVA, regression, and PCA to distinguish treatment effects and community structure shifts.

- Key findings and data-driven insights
  - Productivity and treatment effects
    - Nitrogen and lime fertilization consistently increase above-ground biomass; combined N & Lime yields the highest productivity, though signs of potential plateau or moisture-limitation in the most fertile plots by 2002.
    - Unfertilised plots show reduced productivity over time, likely due to nutrient loss through clipping and reduced fertility.
  - Plant community and diversity dynamics
    - Mowing (site-level disturbance reduction) favours stress-tolerant and moss-dominated communities; declines observed for Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across all treatments.
    - Bryophyte expansion (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) is pronounced across the site, particularly in unimproved plots, and associated with reduced vascular plant monocots in some treatments.
  - Functional classification and ecological interpretation
    - CSR analysis shows a shift from stress-tolerant (S) toward more competitive (C) and stress-ruderal (SR/CSR) species in fertilised plots; unimproved plots favour S species.
    - Insecticide treatment may indirectly influence diversity by altering herbivory pressures, potentially benefiting certain palatable species; overall diversity remains relatively high where nutrients remain limited.
  - Interactions with soil properties and moisture
    - Lime raises soil pH toward ~7.0 in the upper soil profile; higher pH coupled with lime and/or nitrogen affects plant composition and productivity.
    - Positive correlations exist between soil pH and biomass production when considering all plots; treatment-by-plot isolation shows varied relationships, with some plots showing weakened or negative pH–biomass links under combined nutrient amendments.
    - Soil moisture content negatively correlates with pH; higher pH plots tend to be drier, which can modulate productivity responses.
  - Data-driven population and community structure analyses
    - Point analysis and PCA reveal clear separation between improved (fertilised) and unimproved plots; limed and nitrogen-treated plots show distinct but overlapping groupings.
    - Bryophyte abundance increases over time, disproportionately affecting unimproved plots; vascular plant hits shift away from Agrostis/Festuca dominance in certain treatments.
  - Temporal and spatial dynamics
    - Longitudinal biomass data show a general upward trend in productivity from 1999 through 2002, but with annual fluctuations and a notable 2002 dip in several treatments.
    - Block-level slope position influences productivity (lower blocks often show greater gains in earlier years; 2002 shows pronounced declines in lower/elevated blocks for some treatments).

- Data limitations and challenges
  - 2002 weather data gaps due to a station malfunction (July–November), with some data substituted from Konza station for missing periods.
  - New data streams (e.g., detailed bryophyte species data) required adapting analytical frameworks and metadata practices.
  - Complex, multi-factor experimental design (five main plots, five treatments, five blocks across years) necessitates careful statistical interpretation to separate treatment effects from site-level or climatic variation.

- Implications for data governance and practice (takeaways for Data Leaders)
  - Emphasize robust metadata and documentation, given multi-year, multi-treatment, multi-plot data with environmental covariates.
  - Maintain centralized data management for cross-cutting data streams (biomass, species lists, functional types, soil properties, weather) to enable integrative analyses.
  - Ensure data quality checks and versioning, especially when integrating legacy data with new taxonomic or functional classifications (e.g., CSR grouping, bryophyte identifications).
  - Plan for data continuity and contingency (e.g., sensor outages) and have clear protocols for data substitution or gap-filling.
  - Leverage data partnerships and dissemination channels (e.g., Soil Biodiversity website, CEH communications) to support transparency, reuse, and cross-site learning.
  - Use the dataset to inform data strategy beyond this site, highlighting the value of long-term biodiversity and ecosystem-function data for policy-relevant questions and cross-sector collaboration.
