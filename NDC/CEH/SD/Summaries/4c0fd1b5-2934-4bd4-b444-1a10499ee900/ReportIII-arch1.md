# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Location and purpose
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on intensive study of Sourhope field site (Macaulay Institute) in the Scottish Borders.
  - A baseline monitoring framework was established to contextualize detailed studies; includes a schedule of measurements (Table 1) and a description in Baseline Data Survey (1998).
  - 2001 events affected management: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions curtailed site access (Feb–May 2001), with protocol-driven resumption afterward; 2001 also saw a change in the officer in charge.

- 2. RESULTS
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather largely unremarkable; rainfall near the long-term average after a very wet previous year.
    - Total annual radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower; mean soil moisture modestly higher than in earlier years.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass across the sampling period; peak biomass consistently in July or August.
    - 2001 biomass was higher than in previous years, likely due to a combination of staff changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - When normalized against the C1 control, nitrogen and/or lime additions continued to show stronger positive effects on productivity.
    - Separate analyses (ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass) show:
      - Significant differences between improved plots (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots.
      - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
      - No significant differences between blocks.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime addition raised surface soil pH (top 5 cm) to about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen-plus-lime plots (N&L) by Oct 2001.
    - Nitrogen addition alone also raised pH, but less than lime; control plots showed no significant change since baseline (Aug 1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) mirrored 2000 methodology; surveyors’ results were not significantly different.
    - Total plant hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000, suggesting greater sward density, possibly from prior grazing exclusion (1998).
    - Treatment effects on species composition:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments (except remaining most abundant in Control 1 and Limed plots).
      - Festuca species increased across all treatments; Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina were prominent in fertilised plots (notably N and/or Lime).
      - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) showed more Poa pratensis and Poa trivialis; unimproved plots showed species typical of poorer pastures (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
      - 24 species identified in unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) versus 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting reduced diversity with some treatments.
    - Multivariate analysis (PCA) largely separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; improved plots were associated with Festuca rubra and related species.
    - Relative abundance correlations:
      - Higher biomass plots show greater abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
      - Relative abundances of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) decline as biomass increases.
      - Greater litter incidence in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

- 3. SITE HETEROGENEITY
  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity across the site is evident; columns E and F (right-hand slope) tend to contain more acidic plots.
    - This pattern is amplified by the higher proportion of Controls or Biocide plots in those columns.
    - There is suppressed pH in nitrogen- and/or lime-improved plots within these columns, suggesting underlying spatial variability.

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Total biomass per plot shows outliers with low biomass (e.g., certain Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide plots).
    - Higher biomass generally occurs in more centrally located plots (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
    - A strong positive correlation exists between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant biomass difference between blocks (statistical note: F-statistics/N values provided in the report).

- Acknowledgements
  - Thanks expressed to staff and researchers (e.g., Sarah Buckland) for enabling field activities, data collection, and support during 2001.

- Data collection and analysis notes
  - Field measurements included automatic weather data, above-ground biomass (multiple cuts), soil pH (top 5 cm), and a July point-quadrat botanical survey.
  - Analyses included general ANOVA on biomass (with ln transformation), PCA of botanical data, and correlation analyses between biomass and species abundances.
  - The study emphasizes linking plot-level treatments to both above-ground productivity and plant community composition while accounting for site heterogeneity and annual variation.
