# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Report

- Four years into the Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, monitoring above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity under five main plot-level treatments plus controls.
- Treatments include: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Insecticide; mowing is performed regularly, and a soil insecticide is applied on Insecticide plots after mowing.
- Data collection spans weather data, above-ground biomass/sampling, point analysis surveys for plant presence, soil pH, soil moisture, and bryophyte assessments; higher-tier plant functional analyses (CSR framework) are used to interpret community responses.

## Experimental Setup and Data Collected

- Site layout: 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots with randomized treatments.
- Management
  - Site-wide mowing to ~6 cm from May to September each year.
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4) applied after mowing on Insecticide plots.
  - Fertility treatments: Nitrogen and/or Lime applied in spring to designated plots.
- Data collected
  - Automatic Weather Station records (precipitation, temperature, radiation, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground biomass: yearly 5 summer cuts per plot, dried and weighed.
  - Point Analysis: yearly 0.5 m2 cell surveys with 100-point grid to identify species hits; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
  - Soil measurements: soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (via theta probe) at designated times.
  - Additional small-scale surveys: vegetation cover in micro-squares, biomass sorting by species, and other targeted surveys.
- Data analysis: split-plot ANOVA, PCA of point analysis data, and Shannon diversity indices to track diversity changes over time.

## Key Findings by Theme

- Mowing effect
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across all treatments, suggesting a site-level response to mowing (e.g., homogeneous cuts) rather than to a specific treatment.
  - Festuca rubra expanded, especially in fertilised plots, linking to improved nutrient conditions.
  - Bryophytes expanded across the site, possibly aided by ~6 cm sward height from mowing and lack of grazing; bryophyte increases partly dampen in fertile plots due to higher vascular plant productivity.
  - Stress-tolerant (S) species expanded across nearly all plots except some nitrogen+lime plots; ruderal (R) and SR-C-S-R groups declined with reduced disturbance from grazing.
- Fertilisation effect
  - Productivity (above-ground biomass) consistently higher in fertilised plots (Nitrogen and/or Lime), with the strongest response in plots receiving both Nitrogen and Lime.
  - Some signs of productivity peaking in N+L plots, potentially linked to high soil pH (~7.0) and reduced soil moisture stress.
  - Soil pH: lime markedly raises pH; nitrogen also raises pH but to a lesser extent; higher pH correlated with lower soil moisture and with changes in plant functional composition.
  - Functional shift: N+L plots show increased competitive (C) and C-S-R species; unimproved plots (no fertiliser) favour stress-tolerant species.
- Insecticide effect
  - Plant diversity (Shannon index) highest in Insecticide plots, suggesting complex plant–herbivore interactions; however, direct causation through reduced herbivory is not definitively established.
  - The observed diversity pattern aligns with earlier work suggesting insect herbivory can influence diversity, but caution is needed due to incomplete knowledge of insecticide-specific impacts.
- Trampling effect (C2 plots)
  - First-year C2 plots (added in 2002) showed marked productivity declines, likely due to trampling during intense sampling and 13CO2 pulse experiments.
- Plant community structure and diversity (2002 data)
  - Biomass: overall 2002 production declined relative to 2001 across many treatments, though long-term productivity trends since 1999 show an overall increase.
  - Nitrogen and Lime plots remain among the most productive; Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1 in several years.
  - Two dominant grass species (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) dominate improved plots, while Agrostis spp. remain common but less dominant in 2002.
  - Point Analysis: treatment differences evident in species hit frequencies; bryophytes (especially Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increased in 2002, with bryophyte hits highest in unimproved plots.
  - Diversity indices (Shannon) show treatment-related differences since 2000, increasing through 2002 in most treatments, with a notable 15% decline in 2002 for the N&L plots compared to baseline.
  - Functional group dominance: stress-tolerant (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and SR/CSR groups consistently account for a large share of hits; by 2002, CSR and SR/CSR groups show significant treatment-driven shifts, with C-S-R species expanding in N and/or Lime treatments and S species expanding in unimproved plots.

## Functional Groups and Taxa Shifts

- CSR framework results
  - 2002 data show significant treatment-driven differences in CSR-related functional groups.
  - C-S-R and SR/C-S-R species increasingly dominate in nitrogen- and lime-enhanced plots; stress-tolerant species dominate unimproved plots.
- Bryophyte dynamics
  - Bryophytes become more abundant across treatments, with a notable rise in the unimproved plots; overall bryophyte hits increase from 2000 to 2002 across most treatments.
  - Some bryophyte species show sensitivity to nitrogen and lime applications, with certain bryophytes less frequent in N- or lime-treated plots.

## End-of-Period Implications

- Nutrient management strongly drives productivity and community composition; combining nitrogen and lime yields the strongest biomass response but may risk higher soil pH and moisture stress under some conditions.
- Disturbance regime (grazing exclusion and mowing) shifts the community toward stress-tolerant and bryophytic communities, with mowing contributing to a less diverse understory in fertilised plots.
- Insecticide treatment may support higher plant diversity over time, but causality with reduced herbivory requires further evidence.
- Trampling events can substantially dampen productivity in plots subject to intensive sampling activities, highlighting the sensitivity of trampling pressures on experiments with heavy sampling regimes.
- Long-term monitoring reveals a trend of increasing biomass across treatments since 1999, but year-to-year fluctuations (notably 2002 declines) reflect complex interactions among fertilisation, moisture, pH, disturbance, and plant competition.

## Data Transparency and Access

- The project emphasizes tracking data sources, sharing datasets with metadata, and maintaining transparency in methods and analyses to support reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
