# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

Summary of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope

- Purpose and scope
  - Four years into the Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on above-ground productivity, species composition, and biodiversity at the Sourhope field site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders).
  - Examines how management practices affect plant communities and their functional traits, with implications for environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.

- Monitoring design and site setup
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site layout: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block; 10 sub-plots per plot; treatments allocated at random across plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells used to assign treatments to research groups.
  - Treatments (field-level and plot-level): a site-wide mowing regime plus three plot-level treatments (Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime) and an Insecticide treatment (historically Biocide/Dursban 4 OPA).
  - Data collection regime (ongoing since 1999):
    - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station.
    - Above-ground productivity: biomass from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots, clipped prior to mowing, oven-dried, weighed.
    - Botanical surveys: baseline (1998) and annual 0.5 m2 point analyses (2000–2002) using a 100-point grid to record species presence; bryophytes recorded to species level in 2002.
    - Soil monitoring: soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe in 2002); additional soil samples collected regularly since 1998.
    - Additional targeted surveys: small-scale vegetation cover estimates, biomass sampling by species, and other project-specific surveys.
  - Longitudinal activity: Phase I (1998–2001) and Phase II (starting 2002) funded projects, with major fieldwork by Phase II groups and field campaigns, including labelled 13CO2 pulses and trace gas measurements.
  - Data management backdrop: extensive appendices and data catalogs (Appendices 1–8) documenting site activity, species lists, weather data, biomass records, and analytical outputs; data collected totalled over 11,621 soil samples by 2002.

- Key measurements and indicators
  - Productivity indicators: annual above-ground biomass per plot; relative productivity by treatment normalized to a control.
  - Biodiversity indicators: species composition, relative abundance, and Shannon diversity index from point analyses; bryophyte abundance over time.
  - Functional groups: categorization of plant species into stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR) to assess shifts in functional composition.
  - Soil environment: soil pH changes (in relation to lime and nitrogen), soil moisture, and their relationships with productivity.
  - Community structure analyses: principal components analysis (PCA) of point-analysis hits to differentiate improved vs unimproved plots and treatment groupings.

- Major findings by management factor
  - Mowing effect
    - Reduction in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across years, likely due to mowing regime rather than a single treatment.
    - Festuca rubra expands in more fertile, lime- and nitrogen-amended plots.
    - Bryophyte expansion (mosses) across the site, associated with a stable sward height around 6 cm and reduced grazing disturbance.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently boost above-ground biomass; plots with both nitrogen and lime show the strongest productivity but may approach a peak due to high pH and potential moisture limitations.
    - Lime drives soil pH toward ~7.0; higher pH correlates with changes in productivity; potential moisture stress in lime-rich plots during dry periods.
    - Functional shift: nitrogen + lime plots show dominance by competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) species; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerators (S); lime- and insecticide-treated plots show reduced SR/CSR representation.
  - Insecticide effect
    - Insecticide-treated plots show higher diversity indices in some years; literature suggests herbivore pressure can influence plant diversity, with potential short-term increases in palatable, more diverse assemblages.
    - The exact causal link between reduced herbivory and diversity remains cautious due to limited direct herbivory data.
  - Trampling effect
    - First-year trampling in the C2 (certain plots) coincided with reduced productivity, likely linked to intense activity during 13CO2 pulse experiments; trampling suppresses vegetation growth in affected plots.
  - Community and biodiversity dynamics
    - Shannon diversity declined in nitrogen + lime plots relative to others (2002 vs baseline), while other treatments showed stability or increases.
    - Bryophyte hits increased across treatments, especially in unimproved plots, contributing to substantial shifts in ground cover and biomass partitioning.
    - Disturbance regime (reduced grazing, regular mowing) favored stress-tolerant species across most treatments, while nutrient enrichment favored competitive species.
    - PCA and species-rank analyses illustrate clear separation between improved (fertilised) vs unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots clustering with nitrogen-treated plots in some respects, indicating overlapping responses to soil improvements.
  - Temporal trends
    - Long-term biomass increased from 1999 to 2002 across treatments, with the steepest gains in fertilised plots; 2002 saw some overall reductions in biomass relative to 2001, with block- and slope-related variability.

- Data quality, metadata, and governance considerations
  - Data richness: multi-year, multi-parameter monitoring across a designed field experiment with nested plots and sub-plots; rich metadata alongside appendices detailing treatments, species lists, and methodology.
  - Metadata and data quality challenges (relevant to monitoring frameworks)
    - Ensuring consistent metadata across numerous projects and datasets; integration across phase boundaries and multiple research groups.
    Data gaps and data accessibility issues:
      - Public sharing of underlying data can be a barrier; the project recognizes the need for data governance, data cleaning, and clear presentation of findings.
    - Data transformation and standardization: data required normalization (e.g., biomass relative to controls) and handling of missing or inconsistent data (notably 2002 weather data gaps due to a station malfunction).
  - Data governance implications
    - The programme demonstrates the value of transparent, documented data management and governance to support cross-project synthesis and policy-relevant interpretation.
    - The extensive appendices illustrate how outputs (biomass, diversity indices, functional-group distributions) can be shared with stakeholders via reports, charts, and dashboards, provided metadata and provenance are clear.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy relevance
  - Long-term, multi-factor monitoring is essential to detect complex interactions between management practices (mowing, fertilisation, insecticides, trampling) and above- and below-ground ecosystem responses.
  - Functional-type frameworks (CSR, S, SR/CSR) offer a robust lens to interpret ecological responses to nutrient status and disturbance regimes in policy-relevant terms.
  - Data governance and metadata quality are critical to ensuring that such monitoring datasets remain usable, sharable, and comparable across sites and over time.
  - Handling data gaps (e.g., weather station outages) and integrating ancillary datasets (e.g., data from CEH mobile labs) are important considerations for maintaining continuity in monitoring outputs.

- Summary takeaways for monitoring authors and governance
  - A well-designed, long-term monitoring framework with clear treatments, structured data collection, and transparent metadata enables robust interpretation of how land-use changes and management affect plant productivity, diversity, and functional traits.
  - Data sharing and governance must balance openness with data provenance, ensuring that complex, multi-source datasets remain interoperable for policy evaluation and future decision-making.
  - Ongoing observation of key indicators (biomass productivity, species composition, diversity indices, and functional-group dynamics) alongside soil and microclimate variables provides a comprehensive basis for assessing environmental health and the consequences of management choices.
