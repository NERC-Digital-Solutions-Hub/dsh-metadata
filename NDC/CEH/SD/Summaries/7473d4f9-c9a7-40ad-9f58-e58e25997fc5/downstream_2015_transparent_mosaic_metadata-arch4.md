Geolocated orthomosaics of the South Saskatchewan River near Outlook, Canada (2015-2017)

## Overview
- Set of geolocated aerial orthomosaic TIFFs of the South Saskatchewan River near Outlook, Canada.
- Acquired in 2015, 2016, and 2017 for two river sections (upstream and downstream); four acquisition dates: 13 May 2015; 2 Sept 2016; 8 Jun 2017; 12 Jun 2017.
- Eight files total: downstream/upstream for each of 2015, 2016, 2017a, 2017b.
- Ground sample distance: 0.06 m; flight height approximately 1500 m from a fixed-wing aircraft.
- Sensor: UltraCamXp; imagery processed to orthomosaic using Pix4D with structure-from-motion (SfM).
- Up to 160 source images per mosaic; bundle adjustment performed; camera properties fixed using calibration certificates.

## Data Details
- Authors: Phil Ashworth, Andrew Nicholas, Dan Parsons, Greg Sambrook Smith.
- Spatial information included: orthomosaic files embed UTM Easting/Northing; viewable in GIS.
- UTM coordinates provided for the location: 356500 E, 5712400 N; Latitude/Longitude ~ 51.5 N, 107.07 W.
- Spatial scope: two sections of the river (upstream and downstream).

## Acquisition and Processing
- Photography method: conventional aerial plane photography.
- Processing workflow: automated image matching and SfM using Pix4D; large-frame workflow; key-point matching optimized for nadir imagery.
- Georeferencing: calibration certificates used to fix camera properties; properties not varied during processing.

## Metadata and Provenance
- Data format: TIFF orthomosaics.
- Metadata highlights: acquisition dates, platform, sensor, ground resolution, and embedded geolocation coordinates.
- Proximity to GIS workflows: coordinates included in image metadata for easy mapping and discovery.

## Use, Access, and Reuse
- Intended use: high-resolution imagery for analysis of river bed and valley floor features; suitable for hydrology and river morphology studies.
- Discoverability: geolocated TIFFs with embedded coordinates; accessible via GIS platforms.
- Licensing and access details: not specified in the document; data is provided as TIFFs with embedded metadata.

## Quality, Limitations, and Data Leader Considerations
- Strengths: high spatial resolution (0.06 m), precise geolocation, multi-year coverage for two river sections.
- Limitations: temporal coverage is limited to four discrete dates; potential inconsistencies across years or sections; relies on calibration and fixed camera properties.
- Data governance considerations: ensure consistent naming, complete metadata (dates, sensor, processing steps), and documentation of processing chain for reproducibility.
- Data interoperability: ensure a consistent coordinate reference system (CRS) and provide clear access paths to the TIFFs for downstream analysis.

## Stewardship and Next Steps
- Maintain provenance: preserve authorship, dates, sensor, and processing details; document processing parameters used in Pix4D.
- Enhance metadata: include CRS, transformation details, and any quality flags or cloud cover notes if available.
- Plan for updates: if new mosaics are produced, align naming conventions and metadata to support cross-year analyses.
