# South Saskatchewan River orthomosaics near Outlook, Canada (2015–2017)

## Overview
- Geolocated aerial orthomosaics of the South Saskatchewan River near Outlook, Canada, produced for environmental monitoring.
- Acquisition dates: 13 May 2015; 2 Sept 2016; 8 Jun 2017; 12 Jun 2017.
- Two river sections (upstream and downstream) with eight TIFF orthomosaic files in total:
  - downstream_2015_transparent_mosaic.tif
  - downstream_2016_transparent_mosaic.tif
  - downstream_2017a_transparent_mosaic.tif
  - downstream_2017b_transparent_mosaic.tif
  - upstream_2015_transparent_mosaic.tif
  - upstream_2016_transparent_mosaic.tif
  - upstream_2017a_transparent_mosaic.tif
  - upstream_2017b_transparent_mosaic.tif
- High spatial resolution of 0.06 m ground sampling distance (GSD).

## Location and georeferencing
- Coordinates embedded in the orthomosaics for GIS use:
  - UTM Easting: 356500
  - UTM Northing: 5712400
  - Latitude: 51.5 N
  - Longitude: 107.07 W

## Acquisition details
- Platform: fixed-wing aircraft; sensor: UltraCamXp.
- Altitude during capture: approximately 1500 m.
- Coverage focused on river bed and surrounding valley floor; two sections imaged per dataset.

## Data and processing contents
- Each mosaic produced from up to 160 individual images.
- Processing method: automated image matching using Pix4D (Structure from Motion) with a large frame workflow; bundle adjustment optimized for aerial nadir imagery.
- Camera properties fixed and specified using calibration certificates; no variation in camera parameters during processing.

## Outputs and metadata
- Outputs are geolocated TIFF orthomosaics suitable for GIS analyses and environmental monitoring.
- Metadata includes capture dates, sensor details, platform, and precise geolocation within each file.

## Monitoring relevance
- Provides high-resolution baselines to assess river morphology and changes over time.
- Enables time-series analyses for environmental health and policy performance monitoring.

## Access, reuse, and challenges
- Data are designed to be combined with other datasets for enhanced value (e.g., integrated environmental datasets).
- Underlying imagery and geolocation metadata are accessible via GIS-compatible formats to facilitate broader data access and reuse.
