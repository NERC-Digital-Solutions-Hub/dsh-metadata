## Provenance and Authors
- Authors: Phil Ashworth, Andrew Nicholas, Dan Parsons, Greg Sambrook Smith.
- Imagery captured using conventional aerial photography from a fixed-wing aircraft at ~1500 m altitude.
- Sensor: UltraCamXp.
- Processing: orthomosaics generated from up to 160 input images per mosaic using SfM with Pix4D; bundle adjustment optimized for nadir imagery.
- Camera calibration certificates used; parameters fixed during processing.

## Acquisition Details
- Dates of photography:
  - 13 May 2015
  - 2 Sept 2016
  - 8 Jun 2017
  - 12 Jun 2017
- Coverage: two sections of the South Saskatchewan River valley near Outlook, Canada.
- Intent: provide high-resolution imagery of river bed and surrounding valley floor.

## Processing and Metadata
- Processing workflow: automated image matching (Pix4D) with large-frame package; bundle adjustment; calibration certificates governing camera properties.
- Orthomosaic includes coordinate information suitable for GIS analysis.

## Data Access, Use, and Governance
- Data format: geolocated TIFF orthomosaics.
- Licensing and explicit usage rights not specified in the provided metadata; users should verify rights before reuse.
- Suitable for detailed riverine and valley-floor analyses, change detection, and GIS-based mapping across multiple years.

## Data Stewardship Considerations
- Recommend documenting licensing, data access rights, and explicit provenance (software versions, processing parameters, and certificate IDs).
- Ensure consistent coordinate reference system (CRS) specification and vertical datum in metadata.
- Consider data versioning and updating policies if new acquisitions are added (e.g., additional years or sections).
- Improve discoverability with standardized metadata fields and portal hosting (including thumbnails/previews and citation info).
