## Data description
- Geolocated aerial orthomosaics of the river bed and surrounding valley floor.
- Spatial context embedded: UTM Easting 356500, Northing 5712400; Latitude 51.5 N, Longitude 107.07 W.
- High-resolution imagery with 0.06 m ground sampling distance.

## Contextual metadata
- Acquisition area: South Saskatchewan River near Outlook, Canada.
- Coverage for two river sections across two time periods (four dates total).

## Acquisition details
- Platform: fixed-wing aircraft.
- Sensor: UltraCamXp.
- Flight altitude: approximately 1500 m above ground.
- Acquisition dates: 13 May 2015; 2 Sept 2016; 8 June 2017; 12 June 2017.
- Each orthomosaic compiled from up to 160 individual photos.

## Processing details
- Orthomosaics produced from aerial photographs using Pix4D.
- Processing workflow: structure-from-motion (SfM) with large-frame option, followed by bundle adjustment.
- Camera parameters constrained using calibration certificates; not varied during processing.

## Usage and integration
- Orthomosaics include viewable coordinate data in GIS software.
- Suitable for GIS-based analysis of river morphology, bed & floodplain features, and changes over time.
- Can serve as a data product for mapping, environmental monitoring, and planning applications.

## Access considerations
- Large TIFF raster files; ensure GIS software and hardware can handle high-resolution imagery.
- Temporal notes: data spans multiple years; consider potential changes between acquisition dates when analyzing trends.
