## Acquisition and processing
- Dates of photography: 13 May 2015; 2 Sept 2016; 8 Jun 2017; 12 Jun 2017.
- Two river sections imaged; four acquisition events across the years.
- Sensor and resolution: UltraCamXp; ground sampling distance approximately 0.06 m; flown at ~1500 m above ground.
- Imaging approach: conventional aerial plane photography; up to 160 individual images per orthomosaic.
- Processing: automated image matching using Pix4D SfM with bundle adjustment optimized for nadir imagery.
- Camera properties were specified using calibration certificates and kept fixed during calculation.
- The orthomosaic includes georeferencing information (UTM coordinates) viewable in GIS.

## Spatial reference and metadata
- Spatial extent near Outlook, Canada: UTM Easting 356500, Northing 5712400; geographic coordinates approximately 51.5 N, -107.07 W.
- Orthomosaics are geolocated and can be viewed and analyzed in GIS tools.

## Authors and provenance

## Usage notes for GIS visualization
- Suitable for map-based data visualisations of river morphology, bed and valley floor features.
- Useful for cross-temporal analysis across years and two river sections.
- Requires GIS or image-handling software to view the included UTM coordinates and to integrate with other spatial datasets.
