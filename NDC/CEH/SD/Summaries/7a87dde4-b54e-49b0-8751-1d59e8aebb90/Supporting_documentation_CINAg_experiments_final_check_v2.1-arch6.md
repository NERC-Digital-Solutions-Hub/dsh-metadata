# Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy Supporting documentation for data

## Aim and scope
- International CINAg project (China-UK) to optimise farm practices and soil management for more effective use of nitrogen sources and reduced environmental Nr losses.
- Objectives:
  - Develop novel indicators of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and holistic soil health/quality metrics.
  - Test and develop on-field experiments and farm platforms for sustainable intensification.
  - Translate developments to Chinese farmers via the Science and Technology Backyard programme.
- Structure: four work packages (WP1–WP4) addressing fundamental N cycling, novel N technologies, agronomic practices, and predictive capacity plus knowledge exchange.

## Work packages
- WP1: Improved fundamental understanding of N cycling
- WP2: Harnessing novel N technologies
- WP3: Improved agronomic practices
- WP4: Predictive capacity and knowledge exchange

## Locations and platforms
- Four UK farm platforms (2016–2017): North Wyke (NW), Harpenden (HA), Henfaes Farm (HF), Easter Bush (EB).
  - NW and HF operated by Rothamsted Research; EB by CEH; HA by Rothamsted Research.
  - 2016: inorganic fertiliser grass trials; 2017: digestate trials on winter wheat; additional grass trials at EB and HA.
- UK-wide soil sampling (2018): nine sites across Scotland, Wales, and England with at least two land uses per site.

## Meteorological and site data
- On-site weather data: daily rainfall, daily mean/min/max temperatures (NW, HF); site-specific meteorological stations at EB; soil moisture sensors for water-filled pore space (WFPS).
- Site characteristics captured: soil type, texture, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Inorganic fertiliser experiments (grass, 2016; also EB 2017)
  - Complete randomised block design (NW and HF); EB with 4 controls and 4 replicates per treatment.
  - Treatments: Urea (U), Urea with urease inhibitor (IU), Ammonium-nitrate (AN), Control.
  - Total N application across CP fields: 240 kg N ha−1 with P, K, S per guidelines.
  - Plot sub-division for NH3, N2O, and biomass measurements (varying by site/year).
- Digestate experiment (winter wheat, 2017)
  - Complete randomised block design at NW and HF; five replicates per digestate treatment plus controls.
  - Treatments: Digestate; Digestate + nitrification inhibitor (DMPP); Acidified digestate; Acidified digestate + DMPP; Control.
  - Target digestate N application ~190 kg N ha−1 (actual rates varied); bands and harvest/sub-sampling subplots defined.
- UK-wide sampling (2018)
  - Sites with diverse land uses; multiple plots per site to capture variability.
  - Biomass measurements taken at grazed and utilized land uses; sampling aligned with UGRASS-related protocols where applicable.

## Measurements and data types

- Yields and biomass
  - Grass: dry matter (tonnes/ha); quality metrics (CP, ME, NDF, ADF, digestibility, etc.); metabolizable energy; D value.
  - Winter wheat: grain and straw yields; grain moisture; thousand-grain weight; harvest area-based estimates.
- Nitrogen metrics
  - Herbage N content and N offtake; NUEc (crop NUE) and NUEg (grain NUE).
  - Soil N metrics: NH4+, NO3−, amino acids, peptides, mineralisable N; soil inorganic N pools under various extraction methods.
  - Soil dissolved organic C (DOC) and total dissolved N (TDN); DON estimation.
- Soil properties and carbon/nutrient pools
  - Microbial biomass C and N (MBC/MBN); aggregate size distribution; soil texture (sand/silt/clay).
  - Soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM; LOI method); pH and electrical conductivity (EC).
  - Base cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg); total soil C and N; total P.
  - Phosphorus pools: permanganate oxidisable carbon (POXC); citrate extractable P, acetic acid extractable P; Olsen-P.
- Molecular and microbial analyses
  - DNA extractions; qPCR targets for nitrogen-cycling genes: nifH, amoA (AOB/AOA), nirK, nirS, nosZ (clade I/II), ureC.
  - 16S rRNA (bacteria/archaea) and ITS (fungal) amplicon sequencing; OTUs and diversity indices; Shannon index and richness.
- Gas emissions (greenhouse gases)
  - Ammonia (NH3) emissions: fluxes measured with wind tunnels and passive samplers; concentrations analyzed colorimetrically (AMFIA) or via dispersion models (FIDES) at EB.
  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions: measured with static manual and automatic chambers; analysis via gas chromatography or isotopic analyser; cumulative fluxes estimated using area-under-curve methods and Bayesian approaches.
- Soil hydrology
  - Soil water infiltration (mini-disk infiltrometer); soil water release curves using HYPRO-FIT and related models; hydraulic conductivity at different suctions.
- Protocols and data processing
  - Data collection schedules differ for WP1 vs WP2; efforts to harvest at peak biomass; QA/QC with laboratory standards and cross-site checks.
  - Data stored in Excel, LIMS; treatment plots sampled synchronously within sites; N-use calculations based on harvested outputs and applied N.
  - NH3 emissions: cumulative fluxes computed via area under the curve; N2O: fluxes computed per chamber method and aggregated over application periods.

## Data processing, QA, and availability
- Protocol separation for WP1 vs WP2 data; dates aligned to treatment events and harvests.
- Data processing and quality control include use of standards, replication, and cross-lab verification.
- Outputs linked to published datasets and papers:
  - Carswell et al. 2018: Assessing benefits and costs of different N fertilisers for grassland.
  - Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. 2018: Advanced processing of food waste-based digestate for mitigating nitrogen losses in winter wheat.

## Key outputs and implications for data support
- Comprehensive multi-site, multi-year datasets linking fertiliser type, digestate use, soil N dynamics, plant N use efficiency, and environmental emissions.
