# Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy Supporting documentation for data

- The CINAg project aims to use data to demonstrate environmental condition and policy performance related to nitrogen management, with UK-China collaboration to optimise farm practices and soil management to use nitrogen efficiently and reduce environmental Nr losses.
- Objectives include developing novel indicators of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and holistic soil-health metrics, testing these in on-field farm platforms, and translating findings to Chinese farmers through established programmes.

## Project structure and work packages

- WP1: Improved fundamental understanding of N cycling
- WP2: Harnessing novel N technologies
- WP3: Improved agronomic practices
- WP4: Predictive capacity and knowledge exchange

## Study sites, platforms and experimental designs

- Four UK farm platforms (North Wyke NW, Harpenden HA, Henfaes HF, Easter Bush EB) used for fertiliser experiments in 2016–2017; EB and HA also used for additional grass trials in 2017.
- 2018 UK-wide soil sampling conducted at nine sites across Scotland, Wales, and England with multiple land uses per site.
- Experimental layouts:
  - 2016 inorganic fertiliser experiments on grassland at NW, HF, EB with a complete randomized block design; treatments: Urea (U), Urea with inhibitor (IU), Ammonium-Nitrate (AN), and Control; N application total ~240 kg N ha-1.
  - 2017 digestate experiment on winter wheat at NW and HF with five replicates per digestate treatment (digestate alone, digestate + nitrification inhibitor DMPP, acidified digestate, acidified digestate + DMPP, control); target N from digestate ~190 kg N ha-1 (rates varied by plot).
  - 2018 UK-wide sampling included soil and aboveground biomass measurements across diverse land uses.
- Site and soil context:
  - NW: grass trial (Stagni-vertic Cambisol) and free-draining soils; climate and soil data provided.
  - HF: free-draining Chromic Luvisol/Alisol; clay-loam textures.
  - EB: imperfectly-drained Eutric Cambisol; clay loam.
  - EB, HA, HF, NW collectively cover varied soils, temperatures and rainfall patterns to support cross-site comparisons.

## Meteorological and environmental data

- At NW and HF: daily rainfall, daily min/max temperatures; soil moisture sensors (SDI-12) at shallow depths for water-filled pore space (WFPS).
- At EB: soil temperature and WFPS measured with handheld probes; long-term meteorological data from Easter Bush measurement station (air and soil temperatures, rainfall at 30-minute intervals).

## Protocols and data processing (WP alignment)

- Sampling timing varied by site due to weather; crops harvested after full growing season per farm managers’ guidance.
- Yields and biomass
  - Grass: dry matter yields, forage quality parameters (crude protein, metabolisable energy, NDF/ADF, digestibility) via NIR; site-specific harvest methods and plot sub-division described.
  - Winter wheat: grain and straw biomass separated and weighed; grain moisture determined; TGW reported on 85% DM.
- NUE and N content
  - Grass NUE calculated from total N content and N offtake; NUEc (crop) and NUEg (grain) equations specified.
  - N content derived from crude protein and standard conversion factors; N offtake combines N content with yield.
- Greenhouse gas sampling (NH3 and N2O)
  - NH3: wind tunnel systems at NW and HF; acid traps analyzed colorimetrically; cumulative NH3 emissions calculated per plot; EB used a dispersion model (FIDES) for NH3 flux estimates.
  - N2O: static chambers (manual and automatic) across sites; sampling frequency increased after fertilizer events; concentrations analyzed by GC or isotopic analyser; cumulative fluxes via area-under-curve methods and Bayesian models at EB.
- Soil sampling (WP1 and WP2)
  - 0–15 cm topsoil cores (0–15 cm, 15–30 cm, etc.) with segment-specific sampling dates for grass/digestate experiments; 2018 sampling across land uses included topsoil 0–15 cm with pooled plots.
  - Nr metrics: NH4+, NO3-, amino acids, peptides, mineralisable N via incubation; DOC and TDN measured in sulfate extracts; DON calculated.
  - Microbial and biological analyses: MBC and MBN; DNA/DNA-based analyses for nitrogen-cycling genes (nifH, amoA, nirK, nirS, nosZ, ureC) and OTUs; qPCR conditions and QA/QC details provided.
  - Soil physical/chemical properties: aggregate size distribution, texture (sand/silt/clay), soil moisture, SOM (LOI), pH, EC; base cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg); total C and N; total P; POXC; extractable P (CEH Bangor/CHE different fractions), Olsen-P; QA/QC protocols described.
  - P and C pools: POXC, Olsen-P and CE-P measurements with detailed digestion/extraction and colorimetric methods.
  - Infiltration and water retention: soil infiltration with mini-disk infiltrometer; water release curves (HYPRO-FIT modeling, Mualem-Durner, Peters & Durner).
- Data management and quality control
  - QA/QC included use of laboratory standards, blanks, replicates, cross-lab validation, and data checks before release.
  - Data compiled in Excel; specialized instruments and LIMS used for data capture and QC.

## Data products, outputs and accessibility

- Outputs include standardized datasets for NUE indicators, soil health metrics, gas fluxes (NH3, N2O), yields, and detailed soil/property characterisations across multiple UK platforms.
- Project webpage: www.rothamsted.ac.uk/international/china/cinag
- Publications deriving from datasets:
  - Assessing the benefits and wider costs of different N fertilisers for grassland agriculture (Archives of Agronomy and Soil Science, 2018)
  - Advanced processing of food waste based digestate for mitigating nitrogen losses in a winter wheat crop (Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, 2018)
- Emphasis on creating reusable, cross-site datasets and translating findings to farming practice and policy evaluation.

## Key challenges and data-value considerations for Analysts Monitoring the Environment

- Increasing the value of monitored datasets by integrating nitrogen, soil health, and gas-emissions data with other relevant environmental datasets.
- Ensuring broad access to underlying data and knowledge products to support transparency, policy evaluation, and wider scientific use.
- Focus on standardised indicators (NUE, soil-health metrics) and reproducible processing pipelines to enable longitudinal monitoring and cross-site comparisons.
