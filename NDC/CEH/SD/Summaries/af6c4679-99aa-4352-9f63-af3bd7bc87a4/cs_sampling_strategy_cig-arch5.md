# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Long-running framework for the field survey element of Countryside Survey (CS), rooted in the ITE Land Classification first used in 1978.
  - Emphasizes a stratified, random sampling design to ensure representative coverage across Great Britain and its constituent countries.
  - The document documents the historical development, methodological changes, and country-specific adaptations up to CS2007, with clear links to policy and national reporting needs.

- Data Model and Classification
  - ITE Land Classification origins
    - Based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) and spatial stratification to classify land into distinct types.
    - Initial version (1978) used 32 land classes derived from 1 km squares (center squares of a 15x15 km grid) plus surrounding squares; eight samples per class were surveyed.
  - Evolution of classifications and sampling
    - 1984: Land classification expanded to 40 classes; sample size increased to 12 squares per class.
    - 1990 CS: All GB squares reclassified under an all-squares approach; 508 squares surveyed; inclusion of the first Land Cover Map linkage.
    - 1998–2000: Introduction of a revised Land Classification to enable Scotland and later England–Wales reporting; class counts increased (up to 40 in 1990, 45 by 2000); representation adjustments to improve country-specific estimates.
    - 2007: Welsh reporting formalized; country-unit subdivisions created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) expanding to 45 strata; Wales received additional samples (minimum of 6 per Welsh class); England adjustments made to retain precision.
  - Sampling framework specifics
    - Core unit: 1 km squares stratified by the Land Classification.
    - Sampling goal: balance coverage across strata with adequate numbers per class to support national and country-level estimates.
    - Country units: England with Wales, Scotland, and Wales (and Isle of Man adjustments) to support country-specific environmental reporting.

- Data Collection, Processing, and Management
  - Field survey modules
    - 1978: Vegetation quadrats (monitored using ISA-based classification) and soils; habitat areas mapped.
    - 1984: Emphasis shifts toward land use and habitat mapping; still within the 32–40 class framework.
    - 1990: Incorporates Land Cover mapping (satellite-derived) and repeats of key field measurements; continues use of Land Classification as sampling framework.
    - 2000–2007: Additional modules and sub-classifications to support Wales-only and upland reporting; inclusion of upland habitat modules to improve country-level precision.
  - Data processing and comparability
    - Changes to classifications affect national estimates; the document discusses maintaining consistency across surveys while adopting latest classifications for country reporting.
    Maps and tables referenced throughout document (e.g., revised class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland; figures illustrating sampling squares) support data governance and reproducibility.
  - Documentation and provenance
    - Appendices and extensive references provide a detailed history of the ITE Land Classification and the CS sampling program, supporting traceability of changes over time.

- Access, Usage, and Outputs
  - Key outputs
    - Countryside Survey reports (CS1990 main report; CS2000; CS2007 UK results) and associated datasets.
    - Wales-only reporting and Scotland/England country estimates as separate outputs, reflecting devolution and policy needs.
  - Data governance and stewardship implications
    - Clear rationale for updating classifications to reflect policy needs (country-specific reporting) while recognizing impacts on cross-survey comparability.
    Emphasizes maintaining a consistent methodological core (stratified random sampling by land class) across time, with well-documented changes to support data users.

- Challenges and Considerations for Data Stewards
  - Representativeness and sampling density
    - Wales historically under-represented in 2000 framework; additional Welsh samples and Welsh-specific class subdivisions implemented for CS2007.
  - Cross-survey comparability
    - Revisions to Land Classification can alter national estimates; guidance favors using the latest classification for country estimates but notes potential inconsistencies with earlier surveys.
  - Data integration and interoperability
    - Transition from per-class, per-country stratifications to country-unit stratifications; needs robust metadata to enable users to align datasets across years.
  - Metadata and documentation needs
    - Extensive historical documentation (Appendix i and referenced literature) is essential for understanding lineage, classification schemes, and sampling decisions.
  - Data access and long-term preservation
    - Outputs span multiple reports and formats; governance should ensure archival of classification maps, sampling frames, and processing steps to sustain discoverability and re-use.
