# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise utility of CS spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
- CS partners (as of 2007) include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protects sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the survey’s scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permissions.
- Requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Circumstances and precision of release
- Four-digit grid references (10 km x 10 km) may be released under licence to indicate which grid square contains each CS square.
- Precise six-digit locations are only considered in very exceptional cases; UKCEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing exact locations, and licence requests must show the external data has equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could help identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit locations.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organisational responsibilities.
- At licensing end, licensees must confirm destruction of location data.
- No release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult UKCEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Evidence of project management standards (at least equivalent to JCOP) may be required.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Decisions, including denials, follow statutory Act and Regulations; UKCEH supports decisions accordingly.
- UKCEH provides an annual report on access applications and decision grounds.
- For practical use, UKCEH aims to provide timely pre-processing support within moderate demand; case-by-case basis for other organisations.
- Partners are encouraged to consult UKCEH before using CS location data; may involve UKCEH scientific leads to help define requirements or support use, with negotiation of potential collaboration or payment.

## Process for potential users
- Engage with UKCEH early to define requirements, assess need for pre-processing, and explore potential collaboration or support.
