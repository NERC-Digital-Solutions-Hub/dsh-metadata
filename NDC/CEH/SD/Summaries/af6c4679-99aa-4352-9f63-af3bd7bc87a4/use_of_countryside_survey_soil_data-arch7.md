# Sampling design

## Overview
- Soils were sampled in Countryside Survey (CS) across years 1978, 1998, 2007 and 2019; 2019 starts a rolling survey aiming to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
- In 1978 and 1998, the same 256 squares were sampled; 2007 covered all 591 CS squares, but not all measurements were made on all samples.
- A pilot survey occurred in 2018; rolling survey began in 2019.

## Sampling framework
- Soils are sampled from CS X-plots, with 5 X-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates; they may represent very different land uses or soil types.
- Over time X-plots can be relocated due to plot destruction, access denial, or relocation uncertainties; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Identical repeat identifiers refer to the same location, though exact sampling coordinates shift by ~2–3 m within a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

## Sampling methods and depth
- Depth: top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998, 2007, and rolling CS surveys use soil cores hammered into the soil and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm.
- Full 15 cm cores may be unattainable due to stones or shallow soils; core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were made in 2007 on selected cores.

## Measurements and data collected
- 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1998, 2007, and rolling surveys collect multiple cores per X-plot; different cores may have different measurements.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 and again in 2018/19–2023, though not using ISO bulk density method (which would require a complete core). A fuller description and implications are documented (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Statistical analysis considerations
- Analyses should consider CS structure to avoid biased interpretations:
  - If land class structure is ignored, results reflect stock/change of the population.
  - If land classes are included, results become weighted national estimates of stock/change.
- Bootstrapping is not consistently used; a mixed model is recommended with square as a random factor to account for up to five X-plots per CS square.
- For CS, design-based approaches often favor a dispersed set of observations to improve regional estimates, rather than focusing on spatial structure.
- Only one core per location is typically taken; despite this, dispersion and broad sampling improve overall precision and coverage for regional estimates.
- Users are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and to review CS publications listed on the CS website for context.

## Practical guidance
- If using CS soils data, consult UKCEH prior to analysis and check published CS data products and methodologies (Emmett et al. 2008).
