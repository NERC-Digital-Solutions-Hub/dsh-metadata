# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim
- Maximise the utility of CS spatial data in the public interest while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Background and scope
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling programme funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.
- 2007 CS partners include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
- Confidentiality stance is in the public interest; requests handled by UKCEH under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When locations may be released and at what precision
- Location data can be used to determine whether CS squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10 km x 10 km grid square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing by UKCEH; very exceptional access may be granted if the requester proves IP/data confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration and linked to specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- At licensing end, licensees must confirm destruction of location data in writing.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult UKCEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must evidence project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality threshold; users must not attempt to identify precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases following policy principles.
- Approved releases are issued as hardcopy licences by UKCEH, signed by a senior authorising official.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH will follow FOI Act and Regulations in the decision process.
- UKCEH must provide CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS partnership use, UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with UKCEH before using CS location data; UKCEH involvement isn't mandatory but can help define requirements and support appropriate use, with potential negotiation on collaboration or payment.
