# Notes on the downloadable data

- Confidentiality: The precise locations of Countryside Survey squares are kept confidential by UKCEH; external users cannot identify squares with precision finer than 100 square km, making it impossible to determine whether squares fall within defined areas below this threshold.
- Data structure: Field Survey data come from a sample of 1-km squares across GB; each square is mapped and measured at two levels—whole square and within-square features. Measurements include binary and continuous variables (e.g., vegetation, soils).
- Sampling design: The 1-km squares are not a random subset; the sample is stratified within designated strata defined by the ITE Land Classification. The land classification has evolved (32 → 42 → 45 classes) to accommodate country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland). Estimates without accounting for stratification may be unrepresentative and exhibit incorrect variation.
- Exclusions and representativeness: Not all GB squares were surveyed; squares with more than 90% sea area or more than 75% urban area were excluded. Official estimates assume excluded squares have similar vegetative land composition to sampled squares; bias is generally negligible unless a region has a high proportion of sea/urban squares.
- Estimation method: Official estimates are produced using ratio estimates for each land class, weighted by the vegetative land area of each class. Since 1998, standard errors and confidence intervals are estimated using bootstrap methods due to skewness in some features.
- Implications for use: When analyzing CS data, account for stratification and weighting by vegetative land area; recognize the non-random sampling design and potential limitations in regions with high sea/urban coverage. Bootstrapped uncertainty should be used for inference.
