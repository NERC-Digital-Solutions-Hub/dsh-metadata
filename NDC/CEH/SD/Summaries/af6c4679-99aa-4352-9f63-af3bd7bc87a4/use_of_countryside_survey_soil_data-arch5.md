# Sampling design

## Overview
- Soils were sampled as part of Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019.
- In 1978 and 1998 the same 256 squares were sampled; in 2007 soils were collected from all 591 CS squares (not all measurements on all samples).
- A pilot survey occurred in 2018, with rolling survey starting in 2019 to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
- Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sample location and design
- Soils are sampled from CS X-plots; each CS square contains 5 randomly spaced X-plots.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates (they may differ in land use or soil type).
- Over time, X-plots may be relocated due to destruction, access denial, or relocation uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) referring to square 2, repeat plot 1.
- Samples with the same unique identifier are from the same location, though exact sampling positions are ~2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

## Sampling protocol
- Soil is collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998, 2007, and the rolling CS survey used a soil core hammered in and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm.
- In some soils, a full 15 cm could not be collected due to stones or shallow soils.
- Core photographs and dimensions were recorded by lab staff in 2007 for some cores.
- The rolling CS survey adopted the current core-based method.

## Measurements and data handling
- In 1978, laboratory measurements were limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- In 1990, some soil mapping was undertaken.
- Multiple cores were taken from each X-plot in 1998, 2007, and during the rolling survey (2018/2019–2023); different cores have different measurements.
- No chemical analyses are performed by soil horizon; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
- Bulk density was measured in 2007 and in 2018/19–2023, but not using ISO bulk density methods (which would require a whole core).
- Full methodological details are documented (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Statistical analysis considerations
- Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring it yields unweighted stock/change of the population, whereas including land classes provides national estimates weighted by land class.
- Bootstrapping is not always used; the CS structure should be considered, with a mixed model including square as a random factor to account for multiple X-plots per square.
- Only one core is taken per location; design-based approaches (dispersed observations) increase efficiency, precision, and regional coverage.
- For regional estimates, widespread sampling improves overall precision.
- Users of CS soils data are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and to review existing publications exploiting the data (listed on the CS website).
