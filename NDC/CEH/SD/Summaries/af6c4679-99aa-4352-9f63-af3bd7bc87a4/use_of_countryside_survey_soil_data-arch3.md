# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Overview
- Documents the methodology for soils monitoring within the Countryside Survey (CS).
- Covers sampling design, locations, collection methods, measurements, and statistical approaches used to detect significant change over time.
- Describes progression from earlier surveys to a rolling 2018/2019–2023 approach, aiming to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
- Highlights reliance on power analyses to determine sample sizes and the need for consistent protocols to enable national-scale estimates.

## Sampling design
- Soils sampled in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019; early years used fixed sets of squares (1978/1998: 256 squares; 2007: all 591 CS squares).
- Power analyses conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).
- Rolling survey introduced in 2019 to steadily build data, with a target of sampling ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.

## Sample location
- Sampling occurs from CS X-plots within each CS square; five X-plots per square, randomly spaced.
- X-plots within a square are not treated as replicates due to variation in land use, soil types, etc.
- Some X-plots are relocated over time due to plot destruction, access issues, or uncertainty about original locations.
- Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1); repeats refer to the same location, though actual sampling positions may be 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

## Sampling
- Soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples) of the profile.
- 1998, 2007, and 2019 rolling survey used a soil core hammered in and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Full 15 cm recovery not always possible (stones, shallow soils).
- Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken in 2007 for some cores.
- The rolling CS survey adopted the later core-based approach.

## Measurements
- 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
- 1998, 2007, 2018/19–2023: multiple cores per X-plot; different cores with different measurements.
- No chemical analyses by soil horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI analyses.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 and in 2018/19–2023, but not using ISO bulk density method (would require a whole core).
- A dedicated report on implications of these methods and full methodological detail is available (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Statistical analysis
- Analyses should account for statistical structure and land class effects.
  - If land classes are not considered, results reflect stock and change of the population.
  - If land classes are considered, results are weighted by land classes, yielding national estimates of stock and change.
- Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses.
- Recommended approach: use mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple X-plots per CS square.
- Design-based approaches with dispersed observations can improve overall precision and regional coverage, especially when spatial structure is not of primary interest.
- Users are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and to review CS publications listed on the CS website for context and previously exploited data.

## Data governance and dissemination
- Emphasizes consistent data collection and the need for metadata and data provenance to be interpretable for future analyses.
- Notes that findings are typically presented via reports, charts, or dashboards, with a preference for broad dissemination and transparency about data sources.
- Encourages consultation with data originators and adherence to data-sharing and data-management practices outlined by CS and UKCEH.
