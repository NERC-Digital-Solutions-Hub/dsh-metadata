# Sampling design

- Timeline and scope
  - Soils sampled in Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 sampled all 591 CS squares (not all measurements on all samples); rolling survey began in 2019 to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
  - Power analyses conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).
  - Pilot survey in 2018; rolling survey from 2019 onward.

- Sample location and tracking
  - Soils sampled from CS X-plots; each CS square contains 5 X-plots randomly spaced.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates (different land uses, soil types, etc.).
  - Some X-plots relocated over time due to destruction, access issues, or uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Samples with the same unique identifier are from the same location, typically 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m x 2 m plot.

- Sampling procedures
  - Top 15 cm of soil sampled (8 cm for invertebrate samples); 1998, 2007, and rolling survey used a hammered soil core; 1978 used a soil pit for the top 15 cm.
  - Full 15-cm core not always possible due to stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions taken in 2007 on select cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).
  - Rolling CS survey adopted standard core-based sampling.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling survey (2018/2019–2023): multiple cores taken per X-plot; different cores have different measurements.
  - No chemical analyses conducted by soil horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and again in 2018/19–2023, but not using ISO bulk density method (would require entire core).

- Data analysis considerations
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock/change of the population, while including land classes yields weighted national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not always used; structure of CS should be considered.
  - Recommended approach: use a mixed model with square as a random factor to reflect multiple X-plots (up to 5) within each CS square.
  - Design-based perspective: only one core per location is used, but dispersed sampling across many locations increases precision and regional coverage.
  - For analysis and interpretation, consult UK CEH prior to analysis and review CS publications exploiting the data (listed on the CS website).
