# Sampling design

## Overview
- Long-term soil monitoring through Countryside Survey (CS) aims to show environmental condition in a consistent format for assessing environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Analyses are based on standardized approaches to maintain comparability across years.
- A rolling survey started in 2019 to measure roughly 100 squares per year for five years before repeating.

## Sampling history and rolling survey
- 1978 and 1998: same 256 CS squares sampled.
- 2007: soils collected from all 591 CS squares, with not all measurements made on every sample.
- 2018: pilot survey conducted.
- 2019 onward: rolling survey to build a continuous, time-series dataset.

## Sample location and plot structure
- Samples come from CS X-plots; each CS square contains 5 X-plots.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses, soils, etc.
- Some X-plots are relocated over time (due to destruction, access denial, or uncertainty in location).
- Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating square 2, repeat plot 1.
- Within a sampling location, exact sampling points are about 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot corners.

## Field sampling design and procedures
- Soil is sampled from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998, 2007, and the rolling 2018/2019–2023 surveys use a soil core hammered into the soil and then pulled out.
- 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm of the profile.
- Stones or shallow soils can prevent full 15 cm cores; core photographs and dimensions were recorded in 2007 for some cores.
- Rolling CS uses the same core-based approach.

## Measurements and laboratory analyses
- 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998, 2007, and rolling 2018/2019–2023: multiple cores per X-plot with various measurements; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI analyses (no chemical analyses by horizon).
- Bulk density measured in 2007 and 2018/19–2023, but not by ISO bulk-density method (which would require a whole core).
- A detailed methods report (Emmett et al. 2008) documents implications and methodology.

## Statistical analysis considerations
- Analyses should account for data structure, including land-class composition; ignoring land classes yields stock and change of the population, whereas including them provides national estimates of stock and change.
- Bootstrapping is not always used in CS soil analyses.
- Recommended to use a mixed model with square as a random factor to reflect multiple X-plots within each CS square.
- Design-based approach favors dispersed sampling when spatial structure is not of primary interest; increases precision and regional coverage for national estimates.
- Users are advised to consult UKCEH before analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications listed on the CS website for prior analyses.
