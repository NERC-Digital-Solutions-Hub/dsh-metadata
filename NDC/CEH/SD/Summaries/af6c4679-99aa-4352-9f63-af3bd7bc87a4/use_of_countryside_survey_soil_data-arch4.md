# Sampling design

- The Countryside Survey (CS) soils have been sampled in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019, with a shift to a rolling survey starting in 2019 to measure about 100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
- In 1978 and 1998 the same 256 squares were sampled; in 2007 soils were collected from all 591 CS squares, though not all measurements were made on every sample.
- Pilot survey occurred in 2018, guiding the rolling survey approach.
- Sampling locations: soils are collected from CS X-plots within each CS square; each square contains 5 randomly spaced X-plots that are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types. Some plots are relocated over time due to destruction, access permissions, or uncertainty about original locations. Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) to link repeated sampling at the same site; exact sampling points are typically 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m x 2 m plot.
- Sampling design implications: while multiple X-plots exist per square, they are treated as non-replicates in interpretation; the true location may shift slightly but remains traceable via the repeat ID.
- Sampling method and depth: soils are collected from the top 15 cm of the profile (8 cm for invertebrates). In 1998, 2007, and the rolling survey (2018/2019–2023), soil cores are hammered in and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit with sampling from the top 15 cm. Some stones or shallow soils prevented a full 15 cm core. Core photographs and dimensions were recorded in 2007, particularly for two of the four cores (black cores and N mineralization cores). The rolling CS survey adopted the core-based method.
- Measurements and lab analyses: 
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling survey: multiple cores per X-plot with different measurements; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI analyses; no chemical analyses by soil horizon.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and again in 2018/19–2023, but not using ISO bulk density methods (which would require a whole core). A full discussion of implications is published (Emmett et al. 2008).
- Statistical analysis considerations:
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring this can yield population stock/change estimates rather than national estimates weighted by land classes.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; the CS structure should be considered, and at minimum a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for multiple X-plots within each square.
  - CS uses a design-based approach rather than focusing on spatial structure; widespread sampling improves regional estimates.
  - Users are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications listed on the CS website for context.
