# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- Context and governance
  - Funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE program (rolling 2018/2019–2024; award NE/R016429/1).
  - Original CS partners include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

- Confidentiality rationale
  - Locations are confidential to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Protects the survey’s scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- Release circumstances and precision levels
  - Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to indicate which 10 km x 10 km grid square contains each CS square.
  - Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external preprocessing by UKCEH to avoid direct release; must prove equal/higher IP confidentiality than CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent risk and follow same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
  - In all cases, licensing aims to prevent identification or misuse of exact locations; additional constraints apply to derived information.

- Specific conditions of release (licence terms)
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to authorized individuals for the approved project.
  - Licences are finite in duration; data must not be retained for other organisational responsibilities after expiry.
  - Post-licence, organisations must confirm destruction or secure handling of location data.
  - No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.
  - If required, licencees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have somewhat relaxed IP/confidentiality requirements compared to six-digit releases; both prohibit attempting to derive precise locations.

- Responsibilities and process
  - UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - Licence decisions are compliant with the Act/Regulations; denial procedures followed accordingly.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report summarising access requests, decisions, and grounds.
  - To support practical timing, UKCEH aims to provide reasonable preprocessing for CS partners within moderate demand; other organisations are handled case-by-case.
  - Data users are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; involvement from UKCEH may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case by case.

- Practical guidance for data stewardship
  - Embed data access controls and licensing within the data governance framework for spatial CS data.
  - Document and track approvals, license scopes, durations, and destruction confirmations.
  - Maintain secure storage and restricted access, with clear defined roles.
  - Include guidance on preprocessing workflows to minimize the need for exposing precise locations.
  - Establish a liaison point (UKCEH) for pre-processing support, case-by-case assessments, and annual reporting obligations.
