The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Purpose and scope
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007 and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification underlying the sampling framework.
- Aims to produce representative, policy-relevant estimates of habitat and land features for Great Britain, with attention to data quality, stratification, and cross-country reporting (England, Wales, Scotland).

## Core concept: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling
- The ITE Land Classification stratifies land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to ensure representative sampling across GB.
- Early approach used a 1 km square sampling unit and a centre-square classification, with additional surrounding squares assigned to classes.
- Stratification reduces bias from purely random samples and captures regional variation in ecological characteristics.

## Timeline and key developments

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & first field survey)
  - 32 Land Classes derived from 1228 centre 1 km squares; 4 surrounding squares per centre classified (total around 6,039 km squares).
  - 8 squares per Land Class surveyed (256 total).
  - National estimates computed as mean habitat area per square in each class times the class area.

- 1984 (Second field survey)
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total).
  - National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
  - Expanded classification to cover all 1 km squares in GB; 3rd survey with 508 squares.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; repeat of certain vegetation data.
  - Results published in CS1990 main report.

- 1998/2000 (Revised Land Classification; fourth field survey)
  - Land Classification extended to classify every GB square; major surrogates used for a comprehensive, regional/local estimation framework.
  - Separate country reporting explored; 40 Land Classes (expanded from 32).
  - Sampling adjustments reflected in England, Scotland, and changes to enable more robust regional estimates.

- 2000 (CS2000; fifth field survey)
  - Introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales vs Scotland) with country-unit versions of Land Classes.
  - Created 40 strata; added 19 extra squares to ensure representation of new classes; ensured Wales had adequate representation with additional Welsh-specific sampling.
  - Additional upland habitat module proposed to improve upland estimates.

- 2007 (CS2007; adjustments for Wales-only reporting)
  - Wales required Welsh-only reporting post-devolution; added Welsh class subdivisions (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), producing 45 strata.
  - Added 43 Welsh squares to meet representation targets; some English classes reduced to four squares per class due to distribution and precision considerations.
  - England did not receive equivalent increases; impact on some English class precision deemed acceptable by scoping studies.
  - Uplands module retained to improve country-specific upland estimates.
  - Revised Land Class maps for England with Wales and Scotland used for CS2007 framework.

## Sampling design and outputs

- GB-wide sampling framework
  - GB-wide totals of Land Classes used to allocate samples; national estimates derived from class-level data and class areas.
  - Tables and figures (CS2000/CS2007) illustrate square counts, class distributions, and sampling rates by country.
- Country-specific reporting
  - England, Wales, Scotland reporting evolved separately; England with Wales and Scotland treated as distinct units for estimates.
  - Isle of Man sampling adjustments: Manx squares removed from country-unit estimates; replaced by new England squares.
- Upland module
  - Adds targeted sampling in upland and marginal upland areas to improve precision for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Data governance and consistency
  - Shifting classifications across surveys can affect cross-survey comparability; approach favored for consistency within a survey while acknowledging cross-survey differences.
  - The document discusses balancing classification updates with the need for comparable national estimates over time.

## Practical implications for data leaders
- Build a coherent data system around a stable, interpretable stratification (ITE Land Classification) to ensure representative sampling and robust national estimates.
- Plan for country-specific reporting needs and adjust sampling density accordingly to maintain precision across England, Wales, and Scotland.
- Maintain metadata and documentation on classification changes, sampling rates, and how estimates are derived to support transparency and reproducibility.
- Use upland-focused modules and targeted sampling to address biases from under-sampled habitats or geographies.
- Anticipate impacts of reclassification on trend analyses and ensure consistent reporting practices across surveys.
