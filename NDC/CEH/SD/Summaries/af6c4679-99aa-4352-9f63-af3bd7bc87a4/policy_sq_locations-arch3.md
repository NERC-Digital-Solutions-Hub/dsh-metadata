# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

- Scope and aim
  - Policy governs access to Countryside Survey (CS) square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
  - All other CS data are publicly accessible.
  - Goal: maximise public-interest utility of CS data while protecting future surveys, sampling representativeness, and landowner goodwill.

- Background and governance
  - 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.
  - 2007 CS partners include UKCEH, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.
  - Decisions on exceptional releases made by UKCEH on behalf of NERC; FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations apply.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Protect future surveying, scientific integrity, environmental safeguards, and permission from landowners.

- Circumstances for release and precision level
  - Approximate locations: four-digit grid references may be released under licence (identifies 10 km × 10 km grid square).
  - Precise locations: six-digit grid references require pre-processing by UKCEH if possible to avoid release; very exceptional cases may involve external release under licence.
  - Spatial data inside squares (habitat maps, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and are released only under the same exceptional-terms conditions as six-digit locations.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences issued for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other purposes.
  - End-of-license: written confirmation of data destruction and continued confidentiality.
  - No third-party release that could compromise square locations; licensees must not attempt to identify exact square locations from data.
  - Prohibition on using data to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases.

- Responsibilities and practicalities
  - UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, issues hardcopy licences and applies policy terms; approval decisions are documented.
  - Annual report from UKCEH summarises licensing applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - To facilitate practice, CS partners may expect UKCEH to perform necessary pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes (moderate demand).
  - Requests from non-CS organizations are considered case-by-case.
  - It is recommended that potential data users consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; involvement by UKCEH may be beneficial (collaborative or paid arrangements negotiated case-by-case).
