# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- It aims to maximise the public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
- Governing bodies and funders: 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability; UKCEH acts on behalf of NERC; partners include Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NI Environment Agency, FC, CCW, SNH, among others.

- Why locations are confidential:
  - To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - To protect the integrity of the sampling strategy, the environment, and future surveying permissions.

- Release circumstances and precision levels:
  - Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to indicate which 10 km x 10 km grid square contains each CS square.
  - Six-digit grid references: released only under VERY exceptional circumstances, via an external licence, after demonstrating that related IP/data requires equal or higher confidentiality.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
  - If possible, UKCEH should perform pre-processing analyses to avoid releasing precise locations.

- Conditions of release (licence terms):
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organisational responsibilities.
  - Upon licence expiry, organisations must confirm in writing that data was secure and has been destroyed.
  - No data or derived information may be shared with third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; risk of inadvertent location derivation must be avoided.
  - Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to audit landowners.
  - If needed, licence applicants may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases, but both prohibit attempts to identify exact square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases according to the policy.
  - UKCEH issues hardcopy licences containing the policy terms, signed by authorised representatives of the licensee.
  - If approval is denied, decisions follow FOIA and Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - For practical implementation, CS partners should have reasonable expectations that UKCEH can support pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe; requests from non-partner organisations are considered case-by-case.
  - Partners are strongly encouraged to consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; UKCEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
  - Depending on demand, UKCEH may provide pre-processing support within the CS partnership to facilitate practical use.
