# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework for Countryside Survey field work from 1978 to 2007.
  - Emphasises that current sampling is built on decades of methodological development and remains linked to its predecessors.
  - Aims to produce representative, comparable ecological and land-use estimates for Great Britain, with evolving capacity to report by country (England, Wales, Scotland) and, later, upland habitats.

- The beginning: 1970s concept and stratified sampling
  - Stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage across varied land types.
  - Early work by Bunce and Shaw led to a national approach: divide land into strata (Land Classes) based on environmental attributes rather than purely geographic units.

- The first Land Classification (mid-1970s to 1978)
  - Creation of a 1 km square sampling framework using a centre-square approach within a 15 x 15 km grid.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to group quadrats into 32 Land Classes from 1228 central squares.
  - Sampling: eight 1 km squares per class (256 total) for the 1978 survey.
  - Outputs included national estimates of habitat areas derived by applying class-level statistics to class-area proportions.

- 1984 expansion and CS1990 planning
  - 1984 field survey increased to 12 squares per class (total 384) to improve precision.
  - 1990 CS initiated with a revised Land Classification that encompassed all GB 1 km squares, allowing a full-scope, all-squares approach.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation and habitat mapping data collected from earlier surveys; first linkage to a Land Cover Map from satellite data.

- Mid-1990s: extending the classification and regional representation
  - Recognised need to classify every GB square for regional and local estimates; developed surrogates for consistent classification, since computing power could not classify all squares at full detail.
  - 62% correspondence between original 1228-square classification and new, surrogate-based classification; most mismatches fell into neighboring classes, preserving overall class means.
  - Result: adjustments to sampling distribution across land classes to maintain representativeness; some distortions in class representation noted.

- CS2000: separate country estimates and upland emphasis
  - Addressed policy needs to report England & Wales separately from Scotland; confirmed the requirement for country-specific estimates.
  - Implemented class sub-division into country-unit versions and class aggregation where necessary, creating 40 strata (then expanded to 40-45 with subdivisions).
  - Added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes, plus 11 additional squares to balance England and Wales sampling rates.
  - Wales-focused enhancements included subdividing certain classes (notably Land Class 17) to improve Wales-specific estimates.
  - Introduced an upland habitat module (30 extra squares) to improve accuracy for uplands in England and Wales.

- CS2007: Wales-only reporting and further refinements
  - Wales needed Wales-only habitat reporting; Welsh sampling expanded to 43 additional squares, and new country-unit class subdivisions created five new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Resulted in 45 strata; England did not receive corresponding increases in English-class squares to maintain overall framework.
  - Wales received at least a minimum of six squares per Welsh class; English classes 5e and 15e remained with fewer squares due to assessed precision tolerances.
  - Provided a revised England-Wales-Scotland framework map and updated sampling table.

- Data products and outputs
  - Land Classification maps for each reporting framework (original GB-wide and country-specific versions).
  - Tables detailing the number of squares surveyed per class and per country for each survey round (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - National estimates methodology: mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total land area of that class; adjustments made for country-specific reporting and class reconfiguration.
  - Acknowledges methodological notes on consistency of national estimates across different classifications and the preference for using the latest classification for country-unit estimates.

- Key challenges and considerations
  - Ensuring adequate representation of all Land Classes, especially Wales, to support country-specific reporting.
  - Balancing precision versus practical sampling effort across England, Wales, and Scotland after devolution.
  - Dealing with changes in classification over time and maintaining cross-survey comparability.

- Endnotes and references
  - Includes historical appendix summarising the evolution of the Land Classification (1978–2007) and references detailing methodological developments and applications.
  - Emphasises that the sampling strategy is tightly coupled with the Land Classification, with ongoing adaptations to meet policy and reporting needs.
