# Continuous measurements of meteorological parameters (2002-2006) [LOCAR]

## Overview
- LOCAR baseline meteorological datasets collected across seven sites to provide comparable data across the LOCAR catchments (Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern).
- Data were recorded hourly via automatic weather stations (AWS) from 2002 to 2006.

## What was measured
- Soil heat flux at 5 cm (W/m²)
- Relative humidity (percentage)
- Atmospheric pressure (mbar)
- Longwave radiation (in, net, and out) (W/m²)
- Shortwave radiation (in, net, and out) (W/m²)
- Rainfall total (mm)
- Temperature variables:
  - Dry bulb air temperature (°C)
  - Radiometer temperature (°C)
  - Soil temperature at 10 cm (°C)
  - Soil temperature at 30 cm (°C)
- Wind:
  - Wind direction (true mean)
  - Wind speed at 2 m (m/s)

## Measurement approach
- Hourly measurements captured by automatic weather stations and stored on connected loggers.
- Data are raw and have not undergone quality control.

## Locations and timeframe
- Sites (AWST - Automatic Weather Station):
  - CEH Winfrith, FP04
  - Telegraph Hill, FP28
  - Warren Farm, PL06
  - Frilsham Meadow, PL11
  - Bowling Green, TE10
  - Halshaw Grange, TE11
  - Oakley Folly, TE17
- Catchment codes: FP = Frome/Piddle, PL = Pang/Lambourn, TE = Tern
- Measurement period: October 2002 to December 2006 (hourly data)

## Data quality and stewardship
- Data are raw and have not been quality controlled.
- Catchment Service Team was responsible for installation, maintenance, and downloading of loggers.
