# Continuous measurements of meteorological parameters (2002-2006) [LOCAR]

- Purpose and scope
  - Baseline meteorological data collection across LOCAR catchments to provide comparable hourly measurements.
  - Data collected at 7 sites within Frome and Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, Tern catchments.

- Variables measured (hourly)
  - Soil heat flux at 5 cm (W/m2)
  - Relative humidity (percent)
  - Atmospheric pressure (mBar)
  - Long-wave radiation (in, net, out) (W/m2)
  - Short-wave radiation (in, net, out) (W/m2)
  - Rainfall total (mm)
  - Dry-bulb air temperature (C)
  - Radiometer temperature (C)
  - Soil temperature (10 cm and 30 cm) (C)
  - Wind direction (true mean)
  - Wind speed at 2 m (m/s)

- Variable definitions (examples)
  - Heat flux soil 5 cm: energy flow through soil at 5 cm depth
  - Relative humidity: average humidity over measuring interval
  - Atmospheric pressure: actual pressure, not sea-level corrected, over interval
  - Radiation values: incoming, net, and outgoing for long and short waves
  - Rainfall total: total rainfall over measuring interval
  - Temperature: air and radiometer/soil temperatures over interval
  - Wind: direction and speed averaged over interval

- Where measured
  - Sites (site code – site name – catchment code – site type AWST)
    - FP04 – CEH Winfrith – Frome/Piddle Catchment
    - FP28 – Telegraph Hill – Frome/Piddle Catchment
    - PL06 – Warren Farm – Pang/Lambourn Catchment
    - PL11 – Frilsham Meadow – Pang/Lambourn Catchment
    - TE10 – Bowling Green – Tern Catchment
    - TE11 – Halshaw Grange – Tern Catchment
    - TE17 – Oakley Folly – Tern Catchment

- When measured
  - Data collected hourly, with periods varying by site from October 2002 to December 2006.

- How measured
  - Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) recorded all listed readings hourly and stored them on connected loggers.

- Data quality and stewardship
  - Data are raw and have not been quality controlled.
  - Catchment Service Team responsible for installation, maintenance, and data downloads from loggers.

- Considerations for data use and integration
  - Variability in the period of record by site may affect cross-site comparisons.
  - Raw data require quality control before analysis or integration into broader datasets.
  - Units and definitions are provided; ensure consistent interpretation during transformation and dashboarding.
  - Potential for creating self-serve data products (e.g., dashboards, tables) once QA is completed and data are harmonized across sites.
