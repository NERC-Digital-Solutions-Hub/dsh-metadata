# Continuous measurements of meteorological parameters (2002-2006) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Aim
- Provide comparable baseline meteorological data across LOCAR catchments to support environmental monitoring, hydrological analyses, and policy evaluation.

## What was measured
- Automatic Weather Stations at 7 sites recorded hourly measurements of:
  - Soil heat flux at 5 cm
  - Relative humidity
  - Atmospheric pressure
  - Solar and net radiation (longwave and shortwave; both in, net, and out)
  - Rainfall total
  - Dry-bulb air temperature
  - Radiometer temperature
  - Soil temperature at 10 cm and 30 cm
  - Wind direction (true mean)
  - Wind speed at 2 m
- Units and definitions are provided for each variable.

## Sites and timing
- Sites: CEH Winfrith (FP04), Telegraph Hill (FP28), Warren Farm (PL06), Frilsham Meadow (PL11), Bowling Green (TE10), Halshaw Grange (TE11), Oakley Folly (TE17)
- Catchments: FP = Frome/Piddle; PL = Pang/Lambourn; TE = Tern
- Measurement period: October 2002 to December 2006
- Data frequency: hourly

## Methodology and governance
- Measurement system: Automatic Weather Stations stored readings on connected loggers.
- Responsibility: Catchment Service Team installed, maintained, and downloaded loggers at each site.

## Data quality and metadata
- The data are raw and have not been quality controlled.
- Metadata quality and completeness are not detailed in the document.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates the need for clear data governance, standardised high-frequency variables, and site-level documentation to support monitoring frameworks.
- Highlights challenges such as raw data requiring QC, metadata availability, and consistent data management practices.

## Gaps and considerations for future monitoring
- Gaps in data coverage by site (varying recording periods) and lack of QC/standardized metadata.
- Indicates a need for data validation, quality assurance protocols, and comprehensive metadata to enable reuse and governance.

## Accessibility and sharing
- The document does not specify public data availability; governance and sharing obligations are not defined.
