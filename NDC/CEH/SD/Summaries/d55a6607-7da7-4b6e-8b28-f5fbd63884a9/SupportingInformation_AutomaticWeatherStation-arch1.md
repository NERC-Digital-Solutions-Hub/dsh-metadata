# Continuous measurements of meteorological parameters (2002-2006) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Establishes baseline meteorological data across LOCAR catchments (Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, Tern) using seven automatic weather stations.
- Data aimed to provide comparable, hourly meteorological measurements across catchments for the LOCAR programme (2002–2006).

## What was measured (Variables)
- Soil heat flux at 5 cm (W/m2), hourly
- Relative humidity (percent), hourly
- Atmospheric pressure (mbar), hourly
- Radiation: long wave (in, net, out) and short wave (in, net, out) – all hourly (W/m2)
- Rainfall total (mm), hourly
- Air temperature (dry bulb, °C), hourly
- Radiometer temperature (°C), hourly
- Soil temperature at 10 cm and 30 cm (°C), hourly
- Wind direction (true mean, degrees) and wind speed at 2 m (m/s), hourly

## Where measurements were taken (Sites)
- CEH Winfrith, FP04 (AWST)
- Telegraph Hill, FP28 (AWST)
- Warren Farm, PL06 (AWST)
- Frilsham Meadow, PL11 (AWST)
- Bowling Green, TE10 (AWST)
- Halshaw Grange, TE11 (AWST)
- Oakley Folly, TE17 (AWST)

## When measurements occurred
- Data collected hourly between October 2002 and December 2006.
- Periods of recording varied by site.

## How measurements were collected
- Automatic Weather Stations (AWST) recorded readings hourly and stored on connected loggers.

## Who measured and maintained the data
- Catchment Service Team installed, maintained, and downloaded loggers at each site.

## Data quality and accessibility
- Data are raw and have not been quality controlled.
- Definitions for each variable are provided within the dataset documentation.
