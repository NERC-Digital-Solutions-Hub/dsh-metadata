# Continuous measurements of meteorological parameters (2002-2006) [LOCAR]
LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS
LOCAR

## Overview
- Automatic weather stations were installed as part of the LOCAR programme to provide baseline meteorological data across LOCAR catchments.
- Data were collected at 7 sites within the Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern catchments.
- Measurements were taken hourly, with the recording periods varying by site between October 2002 and December 2006.

## Variables measured (frequency)
- Heat flux soil 5 cm (W/m2) — hourly
- Humidity relative (%) — hourly
- Pressure atmospheric (mBar) — hourly
- Radiation long wave in hour (W/m2) — hourly
- Radiation long wave net (W/m2) — hourly
- Radiation long wave out hour (W/m2) — hourly
- Radiation short wave in hour (W/m2) — hourly
- Radiation short wave net (W/m2) — hourly
- Radiation short wave out hour (W/m2) — hourly
- Rainfall total (mm) — hourly
- Temperature dry bulb (°C) — hourly
- Temperature of radiometer (°C) — hourly
- Temperature soil 10 cm (°C) — hourly
- Temperature soil 30 cm (°C) — hourly
- Wind direction true mean — hourly
- Wind speed at 2 m (m/s) — hourly

## Definitions of variables
- Heat flux soil 5 cm: energy flow through soil upwards or downwards at 5 cm depth.
- Humidity relative: relative humidity averaged over the measuring interval.
- Pressure atmospheric: atmospheric pressure (not sea-level corrected) averaged over the measuring interval.
- Radiation long wave / short wave: incoming, net, and outgoing long/short wave radiation averaged over the measuring interval.
- Rainfall total: total rainfall accumulated over the measuring interval.
- Temperature dry bulb: air temperature averaged over the measuring interval.
- Temperature radiometer: radiometer temperature.
- Temperature soil 10 cm / 30 cm: soil temperatures at specified depths.
- Wind direction true mean: mean wind direction over the measuring interval.
- Wind speed at 2 m: wind speed averaged over the measuring interval.

## Where they were measured
- CEH Winfrith, Site Code FP04, Site Type AWST
- Telegraph Hill, Site Code FP28, Site Type AWST
- Warren Farm, Site Code PL06, Site Type AWST
- Frilsham Meadow, Site Code PL11, Site Type AWST
- Bowling Green, Site Code TE10, Site Type AWST
- Halshaw Grange, Site Code TE11, Site Type AWST
- Oakley Folly, Site Code TE17, Site Type AWST
- Catchments: FP = Frome/Piddle Catchment, PL = Pang/Lambourn Catchment, TE = Tern Catchment
- AWST = Automatic Weather Station

## When they were measured
- Data recorded hourly for differing periods at the sites between October 2002 and December 2006.

## How measurements were taken
- Automatic weather stations routinely captured all listed readings on an hourly basis and stored them on connected loggers.

## Who collected the data
- The Catchment Service Team installed, maintained, and downloaded the loggers at each site on a regular basis.

## Data quality and caveats
- The data are raw and have not been quality controlled.
