# Continuous measurements of meteorological parameters (2002-2006) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

- Overview
  - Baseline meteorological dataset collected across LOCAR catchments to provide comparable hourly data across sites between 2002 and 2006.
  - Data comprise automatic weather station measurements at 7 sites within Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern catchments.

- Variables measured (with units and frequency)
  - Heat flux soil 5 cm — Watts per metre squared (W/m2) — Hourly
  - Humidity relative — percent (%) — Hourly
  - Pressure atmospheric — millibar (mBar) — Hourly
  - Radiation long wave in hour — W/m2 — Hourly
  - Radiation long wave net — W/m2 — Hourly
  - Radiation long wave out hour — W/m2 — Hourly
  - Radiation short wave in hour — W/m2 — Hourly
  - Radiation short wave net — W/m2 — Hourly
  - Radiation short wave out hour — W/m2 — Hourly
  - Rainfall total — millimetres (mm) — Hourly
  - Temperature dry bulb — degrees Celsius (C) — Hourly
  - Temperature radiometer — degrees Celsius (C) — Hourly
  - Temperature soil 10 cm — degrees Celsius (C) — Hourly
  - Temperature soil 30 cm — degrees Celsius (C) — Hourly
  - Wind direction true mean — Units not specified — Hourly
  - Wind speed at 2m — metres per second (m/s) — Hourly

- Variable definitions (summary)
  - Heat flux soil 5 cm: Energy flow through soil upwards or downwards at 5 cm depth.
  - Humidity relative: Relative humidity averaged over the measuring interval.
  - Pressure atmospheric: Actual atmospheric pressure (not sea-level corrected) averaged over the interval.
  - Radiation variables: Incoming, net, and outgoing long and short wave radiation averaged over the interval.
  - Rainfall total: Total rainfall accumulated over the measuring interval.
  - Temperatures: Air (dry bulb), radiometer, and soil temperatures at 10 cm and 30 cm.
  - Wind: Direction (true mean) and speed averaged over the interval.

- Where measured
  - CEH Winfrith, Site Code FP04 (AWST)
  - Telegraph Hill, Site Code FP28 (AWST)
  - Warren Farm, Site Code PL06 (AWST)
  - Frilsham Meadow, Site Code PL11 (AWST)
  - Bowling Green, Site Code TE10 (AWST)
  - Halshaw Grange, Site Code TE11 (AWST)
  - Oakley Folly, Site Code TE17 (AWST)

- When measured
  - Data recorded hourly between October 2002 and December 2006, with differing site-specific time spans.

- How measured
  - Measurements taken by Automatic Weather Stations, readings stored hourly on a connected logger.

- Who measured
  - Catchment Service Team in each catchment: installation, maintenance, and downloading of loggers.

- Data quality and governance
  - Data are raw and have not been quality controlled.
  - Clear site identifiers and variable definitions support traceability and reuse, but the lack of QA/QC indicates a need for subsequent data processing and metadata enrichment before broad sharing or downstream analyses.
