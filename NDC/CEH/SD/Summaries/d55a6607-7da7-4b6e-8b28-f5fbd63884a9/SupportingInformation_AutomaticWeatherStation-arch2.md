# Continuous measurements of meteorological parameters (2002-2006) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Automatic weather stations were installed across 7 sites within the LOCAR catchments to provide comparable baseline meteorological data from 2002 to 2006.
- Aimed to create a consistent baseline dataset for Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern catchments.

## Variables measured
- Soil heat flux at 5 cm (W/m2)
- Relative humidity (percent)
- Atmospheric pressure (mbar)
- Longwave radiation (incoming, net, and outgoing) (W/m2)
- Shortwave radiation (incoming, net, and outgoing) (W/m2)
- Rainfall total (mm)
- Temperature (dry bulb, radiometer, soil at 10 cm and 30 cm) (°C)
- Wind direction (true mean)
- Wind speed at 2 m (m/s)

## Measurement details
- Frequency: Hourly
- Period: 2002–2006 (varying lengths by site)
- Data format: Hourly readings stored on connected loggers

## Locations (Sites)
- CEH Winfrith, FP04 (AWST)
- Telegraph Hill, FP28 (AWST)
- Warren Farm, PL06 (AWST)
- Frilsham Meadow, PL11 (AWST)
- Bowling Green, TE10 (AWST)
- Halshaw Grange, TE11 (AWST)
- Oakley Folly, TE17 (AWST)

Site/catchment codes:
- FP = Frome/Piddle Catchment
- PL = Pang/Lambourn Catchment
- TE = Tern Catchment
- AWST = Automatic Weather Station

## How measurements were made
- Readings obtained via automatic weather stations installed, maintained, and downloaded by Catchment Service Teams at each site.

## Data quality and availability
- The data are raw and have not been quality controlled.
- Collected to support baseline comparisons across LOCAR catchments and inform environmental monitoring efforts.

## Notes for analysts
- Since data are raw, pre-processing and QA/QC steps are required before integration with other datasets or policy performance assessments.
- Data structure supports cross-site comparability for baseline meteorological conditions across catchments.
