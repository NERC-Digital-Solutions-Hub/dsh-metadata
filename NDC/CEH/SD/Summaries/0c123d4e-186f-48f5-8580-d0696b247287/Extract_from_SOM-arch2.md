## Overview
- Describes a farm-scale study (Norwood Farm, Somerset, UK) constructing multiple interconnected ecological networks across 10 habitats to express species and interactions in farm-abundance units.
- Aims to standardize data collection, verification, and aggregation to enable cross-habitat and cross-year comparisons of network structure and robustness.
- Uses GIS-based habitat mapping, standardized sampling protocols, and data scaling to produce farm-wide interaction networks for 2007 and 2008, later aggregated.

## Study site and habitats
- Norwood Farm: 125 hectares; mixed-use with ~50% arable and 50% grass/ley pasture; organic since 1990; participated in agri-environment schemes since 2003–2005.
- Ten habitats defined by vegetation; includes arable rotations (e.g., cereal, ley, lucerne), hedgerows, woodlands, margins, and grass margins.
- Habitats mapped via GIS; area estimates updated between 2007 and 2008 due to management changes; habitat areas used to scale species abundances to farm-wide networks.

## Data collection and scaling to farm abundance
- All species and interactions expressed as farm-abundance units by aggregating across habitats and sampling periods.
- Field sampling conducted within each of 10 habitats; data summed across habitats and either across sampling periods (insects) or averaged across sampling periods (vertebrates and plants) to reflect presence/continuity.
- Two-year construction window (2007 and 2008) with networks described and illustrated in the main text (Fig. 1).

## Vegetation and floral measurements
- Vegetation quantified as leaf area per unit ground area (leaf area index, LAI) for herbaceous and woody vegetation.
- Herbaceous: 327 transects (9×1 m) across habitats; ground cover, height, and leaf area indices measured; estimates scaled to habitat area and then farm-wide.
- Hedgerows/woody vegetation: LAI measured and allocated by species based on field surveys; tree canopy dimensions recorded to estimate leaf area.
- Leaf area used to derive relative importance of plant taxa in networks (max monthly estimates for Jun–Aug 2007).

## Floral resources
- Flowers quantified along 361 transects (25×1 m in 2007; 50×1 m in 2008) across habitats.
- Flowers counted as “floral units,” representing discrete foraging units for flower visitors.

## Seed resources
- Soil-surface seeds quantified via suction sampling (approximately 250 samples in 2007); seeds dried, weighed, and identified by specialists.
- Sampling points allocated across habitats using GIS; seeds scaled to habitat area for farm-wide totals.

## Interaction networks
- Networks constructed for Norwood Farm in 2007 and 2008 using field data and literature-based interaction strengths where necessary.
- All networks scaled to farm abundance by summing across habitats and months, then aggregating across years as needed.

### Network 1: Flower–flower visitor network
- Flower visitors surveyed along 361 transects; insects captured, host plant recorded, individuals identified.
- Abundances scaled by habitat area to yield farm-wide monthly totals; then summed across habitats and months; results averaged across years.

### Network 2: Flower–butterfly network
- Twice-monthly butterfly transects (7138 m total); butterflies counted within 2 m on either side and up to 3 m ahead.
- Nectar sources assigned to each butterfly species from transect data and literature; nectar plant abundances used to compute interactions.
- Farm-wide total derived by summing across months and habitats; final network averaged across years.

### Network 3: Plant–leaf-miner parasitoid network
- Leaf miners sampled in 230 transects; leaves with miners reared to parasitoids; leaves trees sampled in hedgerows/woodland to capture additional parasitoids.
- Leaf area-based scaling to habitat totals; networks combined across transects and months.
- Early 2007 identification constraints led to combining miners from different hosts; 2008 follow-up confirmed generalist parasitoids on leaf-miners at the plant-taxon level.

### Network 4: Plant–aphid–parasitoid network
- Aphids and parasitoids sampled in 94 transects (2007–2008); aphid abundances recorded; aphids and parasitoids reared in labs; parasitized aphids (mummies) allocated to host aphids.
- Secondary parasitoids treated as generalists and assigned to hosts proportionally to observed host abundance.

### Network 5: Seed–seed-feeding invertebrate–parasitoid network
- Seed heads collected from Carduoideae, Fabaceae, and hedgerow berries (Aug–Dec 2007); seeds/berries reared for seed-feeders and associated parasitoids.
- Parasitoids assigned based on literature as generalists or specialists; interactions summed across sampling periods, scaled by habitat area.

### Vertebrate networks

#### Network 6: Seed–seed-feeding rodent–ectoparasite network
- Rodent abundances estimated from spatially explicit capture–recapture models; diet-based seed selection for each rodent species using known seed types and relative profitability.
- Foraging rules: frequency-dependent predation with host-seed profitability and seed abundance; seeds scaled to habitat area and averaged across August and November.
- Ectoparasites sampled on captured rodents and aggregated across habitats.

#### Network 7: Seed–seed-feeding bird network
- Granivorous birds enumerated across the farm in August and November; refined by excluding certain abundant but non-ground-foraging birds.
- Seed resources assigned by plant-family diet data; energy content of seeds used to allocate interactions within families.
- Birds move across habitats; farm-wide estimates derived by aggregating across habitats with adjustments for woodland and rough ground where necessary.

## Temporal integration and data handling
- Networks constructed separately for 2007 and 2008 and then aggregated to farm-scale totals.
- For insects, monthly sampling periods treated as discrete units; for vertebrates and plants, presence was treated as continuous across the sampling window.
- Data supported by extensive supplementary references and methods, with figure references indicating network illustrations in the main paper.

## Data structure and accessibility considerations for analysts
- The approach demonstrates standardised data integration across diverse taxa and interaction types, enabling comparative analysis of network structure and robustness.
- Ecological interactions are represented on a common farm-abundance axis, facilitating cross-network comparisons and potential integration with other environmental datasets.
- The study highlights explicit assumptions (e.g., decomposition of complex interactions into farm-scale abundances, use of literature-based interaction strengths where field data are lacking) and explicit scaling by habitat area to support reproducibility and transparency.
