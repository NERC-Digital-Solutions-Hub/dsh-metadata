- Context and aim
  - Describes methods for constructing and quantifying a suite of ecological interaction networks on a farm to assess robustness and restoration potential.
  - Uses farm-scale data to express species and interactions in uniform units (abundance on the farm) to enable cross-habitat integration and comparison over time.

- Study site and habitat definitions
  - Norwood Farm, Somerset, UK (125 ha) with 10 defined habitats based on vegetation: cereals, ley, lucerne, hedges, woodland, margins, pastures, etc.
  - Organic since 1990; participation in Countryside Stewardship and Organic Entry Level Stewardship schemes; habitat areas mapped with GIS and updated between 2007 and 2008.
  - Data aggregated across habitats to yield farm-wide networks; habitat areas drive scaling of abundances.

- Overview of network construction approach
  - Networks created for 2007 and 2008 using field data on interaction strengths or inferred from abundance and literature.
  - Abundances summed across habitats and sampling periods to produce farm-scale monthly totals; networks then averaged across months and years to yield final farm-scale networks.
  - Multiple sampling methods employed across taxa; habitat and time variation accounted for via aggregation and scaling.

- Vegetation and floral resources quantification
  - Vegetation quantified as species-specific leaf area for the farm (leaf area index, LAI).
  - Herbaceous vegetation: 327 transects (9×1 m), monthly sampling, ground cover and height recorded; LAI measured and apportioned to species; for hedgerows/woodland, canopy characteristics used to estimate leaf area.
  - Floral resources: flowers counted as floral units along 361 transects; transect lengths differed by year (2007: 25×1 m; 2008: 50×1 m); floral units linked to visitors as nectar sources.

- Seed resource quantification
  - Soil-surface seeds estimated via suction sampling (~250 samples in 2007); seeds dried, weighed, identified; samples scaled up to habitat area.
  - Seed abundance used to inform seed-related networks and overall resource availability.

- Network 1: Flower-flower visitor network
  - Flower visitors surveyed along 361 transects; insects captured and identified; host plants recorded.
  - Densities scaled by habitat area and summed across habitats and months for farm-scale totals; final network averaged across years.

- Network 2: Flower-butterfly network
  - Twice-monthly butterfly transects (2007) covering 2% of farm area; butterflies counted along transects.
  - Nectar sources for butterflies assigned from transect data and literature; interactions scaled to provide farm-wide totals.

- Network 3: Plant-Leaf-miner parasitoid network
  - Leaf miners sampled in herbaceous and hedgerow vegetation (230 transects); leaves with mines reared to parasitoids.
  - Total leaf area used to scale parasitoid counts by plant species; additional sampling on trees (157 branches) to capture tree-associated parasitoids.
  - 2007 constraints led to combining miners from different hosts; 2008 follow-up confirmed generalist patterns, leading to an approximate plant–leaf-miner parasitoid network.

- Network 4: Plant-aphid-parasitoid network
  - Aphids and parasitoids sampled in 94–97 transects across habitats (2008 due to prior workload constraints).
  - Aphids counted; parasitoids reared; secondary parasitoids assigned to their hosts; densities scaled to habitat area and summed across months.

- Network 5: Seed-seed-feeding invertebrate-parasitoid network
  - Seed heads collected from selected hosts (Carduoideae, Fabaceae, hedgerow berries) August–December 2007; seeds/berries reared for insects and parasitoids.
  - Interactions inferred from reared species; parasitoids assigned to hosts based on generalist/specialist patterns; densities scaled by habitat area and summed across habitats.

- Vertebrate seed-feeders networks
  - Network 6: Seed-seed-feeding rodent-ectoparasite network
    - Rodent species and habitat-specific abundances estimated from capture–recapture data; seeds per habitat allocated to rodent species based on frequency-dependent foraging and seed profitability (handling time related to seed size).
    - Ectoparasites counted on captured mammals and scaled to habitat abundances; results combined across habitats and months.

  - Network 7: Seed-seed-feeding bird network
    - Granivorous birds identified; abundance across the farm estimated from counts in August and November 2007.
    - Seeds assigned to birds by family and energy content; where quantified data were missing, imputed using related species’ diets.
    - Birds’ movements across habitats acknowledged; energy-based weighting used to distribute plant seeds across diets; habitat-specific totals aggregated to farm scale.

- Data sources, integration, and methodological notes
  - Integration relies on field data, literature-derived diet/interaction information, and GIS-based habitat area estimates.
  - Use of leaf area index, transects, and suction sampling to standardize resource and interaction metrics across habitats.
  - Some taxa identifications and interactions rely on generalist assumptions or literature, with explicit notes on limitations and assumptions.
  - Timescales and sampling intensity varied by year and habitat; final networks represent farm-scale aggregates across months and years.
