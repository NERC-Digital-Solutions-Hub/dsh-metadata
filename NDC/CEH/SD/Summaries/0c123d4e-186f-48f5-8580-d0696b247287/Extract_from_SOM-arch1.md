## Part 1. Details of the study site
- Study site: Norwood Farm, Somerset, UK (125 ha) with 10 defined habitats based on current vegetation; arable and grassland components; organic management since 1990; participation in Countryside Stewardship (2003) and Organic Entry Level Stewardship (2005).
- Farm management schemes provided payments for environmental options (hedgerow management, in-field trees, field margins, species-rich meadow, grazed pasture, organic status).
- Hedgerows and margins: total hedge lengths 11.0 km mature and 1.4 km new; mean hedge dimensions: mature hedges ~4.1 m high, 3.6 m wide; new hedges ~1.9 m high, 1.3 m wide.
- Habitat mapping: habitats mapped with GIS for 2007 and 2008; areas changed due to management, enabling farm-wide quantitative networks by area scaling.
- Abundance data: species abundance and interaction frequencies scaled to farm area to yield farm-wide networks.

## Part 2. Constructing the interaction networks
- Primary aim: express all species and interactions on the farm site in farm-abundance units; data collected across 10 habitats; networks built for 2007 and 2008 using field data and literature-derived interaction strengths.
- Data collection approach: multiple field sampling methods across habitats and periods; data aggregated across habitats and over time (summing or averaging depending on organism group).
- Networks constructed: seven distinct networks, covering plant-arthropod, plant-vertebrate, and seed/parasitoid interactions; some interaction strengths drawn from literature where direct field data were unavailable.

### Quantifying vegetation
- Leaf area quantified farm-wide as leaf area index (LAI) per species; herbaceous vegetation measured along 327 transects (9×1 m) per habitat; woody vegetation measured using tree heights and canopy radii; LAI multipliers applied to habitat areas; maximum monthly LAI used for leaf-area weighting.

### Quantifying floral units
- Flowers counted as floral units; transects totaling 361 (2007) and 361 (2008) across habitats (transect lengths varied by year: 25×1 m in 2007, 50×1 m in 2008).
- Floral units used to represent potential pollinator foraging opportunities; densities scaled by habitat area to farm totals.

### Quantifying seeds
- Soil-surface seeds collected via suction sampling (≈250 samples in 2007); seeds dried, weighed, and identified; sampling points chosen randomly within habitats; seed data scaled to habitat area.

### Network 1: Flower-flower visitor network
- Flower-visitors surveyed along 361 transects; insects captured and host plant recorded; data scaled to farm totals by habitat area and summed across months; farm-wide monthly totals averaged across 2007 and 2008.

### Network 2: Flower-butterfly network
- Twice-monthly butterfly transects in 2007; total transect length 7,138 m; butterflies counted within 2 m on each side and up to 3 m ahead; transect covered ~2% of farm.
- Nectar sources assigned to butterflies using transect data and literature; interactions aggregated across months and habitats to farm totals.

### Network 3: Plant-Leaf-miner parasitoid network
- Leaf miners sampled in 230 transects (2007) with lab rearing of parasitoids; additional tree sampling (157 branches) for leaf area and parasitoid counts.
- In 2007, miners from different hosts combined due to time constraints; 2008 follow-up indicated generalist parasitoids with plant-specific leaf-miner associations; network assembled from transect and tree data.

### Network 4: Plant-aphid-parasitoid network
- Aphids and parasitoids sampled in 94 transects (2008); aphid counts and parasitized aphids collected; mummies reared in lab; secondary parasitoids assigned to hosts due to generalism; totals scaled by habitat area and summed across months.

### Network 5: Seed-Seed-feeding invertebrate-parasitoid network
- Seed heads collected from Carduoideae, Fabaceae, and hedgerow berries (Aug–Dec 2007); emergence of seed-feeders, fungi-feeders, predators, and parasitoids recorded; parasitoids assigned via literature as generalists or specialists; interactions summed across sampling periods and scaled by habitat area.

### Vertebrate networks (Networks 6 and 7)
- Network 6: Seed-seed-feeding rodent-ectoparasite network
  - Rodent abundances per habitat estimated from spatially explicit capture-recapture models; foraging on seeds modeled with frequency-dependent rules incorporating seed profitability and handling time; ectoparasites per rodent recorded and scaled by rodent abundance to yield final network.
- Network 7: Seed-seed-feeding bird network
  - Granivorous birds enumerated across the farm via August and November counts; seeds consumed assigned using literature-based dietary information; energy content of seeds used to allocate diet; bird foraging across habitats addressed by farm-wide estimates, with separate treatment for woodland and rough ground as needed.
- For birds, energy-based allocation was used due to variability in seed sizes and handling times, rather than strictly foraging frequency alone.

### Data sources and references
- Interaction strengths for some networks sourced from literature; farm-specific data collected from 2007 and 2008 fieldwork.
- Supplementary references (numbers provided in the document) detail methods and prior work underpinning network construction.

### Notable methodological notes
- Cross-habitat aggregation: data from multiple habitats and sampling periods were summed or averaged to produce farm-scale networks.
- Adaptations and assumptions: certain host-parasitoid relationships were inferred or generalized where direct rearing data were not available; 2007 time constraints necessitated some approximate groupings, later refined with 2008 data.
- Scaling to farm level: all abundance and interaction data were scaled by habitat area to generate farm-wide networks, enabling assessment of network structure and potential robustness across the entire farm system.
