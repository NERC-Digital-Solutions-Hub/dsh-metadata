# The Robustness and Restoration of a Network of Ecological Networks

- Purpose of the referenced material: to document the Materials and Methods for constructing and scaling a suite of ecological interaction networks on a single farm (Norwood Farm, Somerset, UK) across 2007–2008, expressed in uniform farm-scale abundance units to enable cross-network comparisons.

## Study site and data scope

- Location and size: Norwood Farm, 125 hectares in Somerset, UK.
- Habitat definition: 10 distinct habitats chosen by current vegetation; arable crops and various grassland/woodland elements treated as separate habitats (e.g., cereal, ley, lucerne; hedges; woodland).
- Management context: organically managed since 1990; involved in countryside Stewardship and organic entry-level schemes since the mid-2000s.
- Spatial data: habitats mapped in GIS; habitat areas recalculated yearly due to management changes.
- Data aggregation goal: convert species abundance and interaction measures to a single farm-wide abundance unit for each network, enabling integration across habitats and time.

## Data collection and measurement approaches

- Vegetation quantification: leaf area for both herbaceous and woody vegetation; transect-based surveys (327 transects for herbaceous; additional canopy measurements for hedgerows and woodland); leaf area indices (LAI) calculated and scaled to habitat areas; maximum monthly LAI values used for relative importance.
- Floral resources: flowers counted as floral units along transects (361 total); transect lengths varied by year (2007: 25 m × 1 m; 2008: 50 m × 1 m) but scaled to farm area; nectar sources linked to pollinator data from transects and literature.
- Seed abundance: soil-surface seeds collected via suction sampling (≈250 samples in 2007); seeds dried, weighed, and identified; random point selection within habitats; seeds scaled to habitat area.
- Data harmonization across taxa: estimates from multiple habitats and sampling periods were summed or averaged depending on taxa (e.g., insects scaled across habitats and months; vertebrates/plants averaged over presence on the farm across the study duration).

## Network construction and scaling (Networks 1–7)

- Common framework: all networks are built to reflect interactions on the farm in abundance units, aggregated across habitats and time, then combined to yield farm-scale networks.

- Network 1: Flower-flower visitor network
  - Data: flower-visiting insects captured along 361 transects; host plant recorded; abundances scaled to farm-area totals.
  - Temporal scope: data from 2007 and 2008, combined to farm-scale monthly totals and then averaged across years.

- Network 2: Flower-butterfly network
  - Data: twice-monthly butterfly transects (7138 m total); butterflies counted and assigned to habitats.
  - Nectar sourcing: nectar plants determined from transects and literature; interactions inferred by proportional nectar plant abundance.
  - Spatial scope: transects covered ~2% of farm area; farm-scale totals derived by summing months and habitats.

- Network 3: Plant-Leaf-miner parasitoid network
  - Data: leaf miners surveyed via 230 herbaceous/hedgerow transects; leaves with miners reared for parasitoids.
  - Additional sampling: 157 branches from standing trees for parasitoids; leaf area used to scale parasitoid numbers to tree/host leaf area.
  - Special consideration: 2007 identification constraints led to combining miners from different hosts; 2008 follow-up suggested generalist parasitoids with plant-specific mining, informing network structure.

- Network 4: Plant-aphid-parasitoid network
  - Data: aphid counts and parasitized aphids collected from 94 transects (across habitats and months) in 2008; mummies reared for parasitoids; secondary parasitoids assigned to aphid hosts.
  - Scaling: densities multiplied by habitat area and summed across habitats and months.

- Network 5: Seed-Seed-feeding invertebrate-parasitoid network
  - Data: collected seeds/seed heads from Carduoideae, Fabaceae, and hedgerow berries across transects (Aug–Dec 2007); reared for seed-feeders and parasitoids.
  - Host assignment: parasitoids assigned based on literature and host abundance; interactions summed across sampling periods and scaled by habitat area.

- Network 6: Seed-seed-feeding rodent-ectoparasite network
  - Data: rodent abundances per habitat from spatially explicit capture-recapture data; seed abundances per habitat from seed studies.
  - Foraging model: modified frequency-dependent predation with foraging profitability (seed energy per unit handling time) guiding seed selection.
  - Parasites: ectoparasite counts per rodent recorded and scaled by rodent abundance to yield the final network.

- Network 7: Seed-seed-feeding bird network
  - Data: abundances of granivorous birds from August/November 2007 field surveys; seeds consumed by birds inferred from literature and adjusted by habitat context.
  - Diet quantification: energies of seeds used to allocate diet by family and species; within-family proportions guided by seed-energy estimates from suction samples.
  - Movement scope: birds often move across habitats; farm-scale estimates produced with adjustments for woodland and rough ground habitats.

## Vegetation and resource quantification details

- Vegetation metrics: leaf area and leaf area index (LAI) used to determine the relative importance of plant taxa; woody plant leaf area estimated via canopy height/radius relationships and woodland composition surveys.
- Floral resources: floral units measured across a large transect network; nectar plant associations established per habitat and month.
- Seed resources: suction-sampled seeds quantified to inform seed-based interactions across networks.

## Temporal and spatial synthesis

- Temporal scaling: sampling across multiple months and years (2007–2008) with decisions to sum or average depending on organism presence and lifecycles.
- Spatial scaling: habitat-level data aggregated to farm-scale totals; habitat area changes accounted for; GIS used to maintain consistent spatial context.

## Data quality, limitations, and governance notes

- Assumptions and approximations: several networks relied on literature-derived interaction strengths or generalist/parasitism patterns when direct interaction data were not available; some taxa were pooled (e.g., miners from different hosts) due to identification constraints.
- Sampling constraints: 2007 fieldwork faced time limitations; subsequent adjustments in 2008 (e.g., for parasitoids, butterfly sampling) helped refine network estimates.
- Data integration: extensive cross-habitat and cross-year integration required careful standardization to maintain comparability across networks.

## Metadata and sources

- Supplementary materials include Table S1 describing habitats and a Figure S1 showing sampling times; numerous references accompany method details (Tables and figures cited in the text).
- The integrated approach provides a comprehensive dataset linking vegetation, floral resources, seed availability, and multi-trophic interactions across a real farm system.

- Note: The document provides a detailed blueprint for converting complex, heterogeneous field data into standardized, farm-scale interaction networks suitable for comparative ecological analysis and robustness/restoration studies.
