- Purpose and scope
  - Detailed methods for a farm-scale study at Norwood Farm, Somerset, UK, describing the study site, data collection across multiple habitats, and construction of interconnected ecological networks.
  - Networks are expressed in farm-abundance units and integrated across habitat patches and time periods.

- Part 1: Details of the study site
  - Location and extent: Norwood Farm, 125 ha, 51.3128° N, 2.3206° W.
  - Habitat framework: 10 habitats defined by vegetation (e.g., cereal, ley, lucerne; hedgerow and woodland elements).
  - Management context: organic since 1990; involved in Countryside Stewardship (since 2003) and Organic Entry Level Stewardship (since 2005).
  - Hedges: 11.0 km mature, 1.4 km new; mean hedge dimensions described.
  - GIS mapping and area estimation: habitats mapped in GIS; areas re-estimated in 2007 and 2008 due to management changes; habitat areas used to scale species abundance and interactions to farm level.

- Part 2: Constructing the interaction networks
  - Core aim: unify all species and interactions in farm-wide abundance units; data collected from 10 habitats; multiple sampling periods; networks for 2007 and 2008.
  - Data sources and approaches: field surveys and literature-derived interaction strengths for certain taxa; data aggregated across habitats and sampling periods (insects summed monthly; vertebrates and plants averaged across presence duration).
  - Vegetation quantification
    - Leaf area as a key plant metric; herbaceous vegetation measured via 327 transects (9×1 m) across habitats; LAI measured with LI-COR LAI-2000; leaf area allocated to present species and scaled to habitat area.
    - Woodland canopy: trees measured (height, canopy radius); canopy leaf area estimated from allometric relationships; woodland LAI taken from literature and scaled by woodland area; use of June–August 2007 monthly maximum for leaf-area values.
  - Quantifying floral units
    - Flowers counted as floral units along 361 transects (differing lengths between years: 2007 = 25×1 m; 2008 = 50×1 m).
    - Transects run in randomly selected locations; density scaled by habitat area to yield farm-wide totals; nectar sources assigned for pollinator interactions.
  - Quantifying seeds
    - Soil-surface seeds collected via suction sampling (~250 samples in 2007); seeds identified by specialists; dry-weight used to estimate seed abundance; area-based scaling applied.
  - Network 1: Flower–flower visitor network
    - Flower visitors sampled along 361 transects; insects captured, host plant recorded; densities scaled to farm area; monthly farm totals summed across habitats and years; final network averaged over years.
  - Network 2: Flower–butterfly network
    - Twice-monthly butterfly transects (2007) totaling 7138 m; 2 m on either side of transect; 2% of farm area covered; nectar plant associations assigned per habitat and month; networks aggregated across months and habitats.
  - Network 3: Plant–leaf-miner parasitoid network
    - Leaf-miner sampling across 230 transects; leaves with miners reared for parasitoids; leaf area estimated per plant species; additional sampling from trees in hedgerows/woodlands; 2007 constraints acknowledged; 2008 indicated parasitoids were generalists on leaf miners with plant-specific tendencies.
  - Network 4: Plant–aphid–parasitoid network
    - Aphids and parasitoids sampled in 94 transects in 2008; aphid counts and mummy parasitism recorded; secondary parasitoids assigned to hosts; counts scaled by habitat area and summed across habitats and months.
  - Network 5: Seed–seed-feeding invertebrate–parasitoid network
    - Seed heads collected from Carduoideae, Fabaceae, and hedgerow berries; emergence of seed-feeding insects and parasitoids tracked; parasitoids assigned to hosts based on literature and host abundance; interactions scaled by habitat area and time.
  - Vertebrate seed-feeders networks
    - Network 6: Seed–seed-feeding rodent–ectoparasite network
      - Rodent abundances obtained via spatially explicit capture–recapture models; seed abundances from prior steps; foraging modeled as frequency-dependent with seed profitability (handling time related to seed mass) and habitat-specific abundances; ectoparasites counted per rodent and scaled across habitats.
    - Network 7: Seed–seed-feeding bird network
      - Granivorous birds enumerated via field surveys (August and November); seeds attributed to bird diets using family-level and species-specific data; energy-based weighting applied to seed items; landscape-scale integration to farm level; separate treatment for woodland and rough ground habitats.
  - Table S1 and habitat descriptions
    - Detailed table listing habitats (e.g., wood, cereal types, lucerne, margins, pastures, hedges) with area values for 2007 and 2008; notes on habitats excluded or changed.
  - Figure S1
    - Diagram of sampling schedule, indicating months and habitats when each data type was collected.

- GIS-related implications
  - Demonstrates how multi-year, multi-habitat ecological data can be mapped, stored, and scaled to a farm-level network using GIS-derived habitat areas.
  - Highlights data integration challenges, including reconciling different resolutions (leaf area, floral units, seeds, vertebrate counts) and aggregating across spatial patches and time periods.
  - Provides a blueprint for visualizing complex, multi-taxa interactions on maps and for producing map-based data products that reflect ecosystem structure and function.
