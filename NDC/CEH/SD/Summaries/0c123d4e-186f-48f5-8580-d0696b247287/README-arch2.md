# Description of data files.

- Context and purpose
  - Estimates of plant abundance for leaf area, floral units, and seeds (mass and energy) from field sampling as part of a study of ecological interactions (food webs and plant-pollinator networks) on Norwood Farm, Somerset, UK, conducted in 2007–2008.
  - Farm managed as an organic, low-intensity system.
  - Primary reference: Pocock et al. (2012); dataset published in Dryad; detailed study site description in Pocock et al. (2012) and its Supplementary Online Material (SOM).

- Data files and what they contain
  - leafarea.csv: leaf area index for each plant taxon, in each habitat, each sampling month. Derived from transects (up to four 9 x 1 m transects per habitat per month) with LAI-2000 measurements ( woodland leaf area inferred from literature). Leaf area apportioned among species by abundance x height and scaled to habitat area.
  - floralunits.csv: number of floral units per taxon, in each habitat, each sampling month. Floral units defined per taxon as entities that pollinators fly between. Transects: 25 x 1 m (2007) and 50 x 1 m (2008).
  - seeds.csv: seeds per taxon, habitat, season. Includes total count, mass (kg), and energy (kJ). Seed sampling via vacuum sampler, 7-second exposure, oven-dried, sieves used to separate seeds, specialists identify taxa. Large samples sub-sampled and scaled; under-sampling corrected using factor from Evans et al. (2009). Mass and energy sourced from site data and databases; totals scaled by habitat area.
  - habitatarea.csv: description of habitat codes used in the above files and the area of each habitat in each sampling period. Year 1 corresponds to 2007 for leafarea/floralunits and to winter/spring/summer 2007 for seeds; Year 2 corresponds to 2008 for leafarea/floralunits and autumn 2007 for seeds.

- Methodological notes
  - Leaf area: LAI-2000 measurements; total leaf area apportioned by species abundance and height; scaled by habitat area.
  - Floral units: counts reflect pollinator movement rather than just physical flower count; transect dimensions adjusted across years.
  - Seeds: under-sampling correction applied; seed energy and mass derived from site data and external databases; area scaling applied to yield totals per habitat.
  - Data provenance and full methodology described in Pocock et al. (2010, 2012) and SOM; full details available in the accompanying materials.

- Study site and scale
  - Site: Norwood Farm, Somerset, UK (51.3128 N, 2.3206 W); organic, low-intensity management.
  - Spatial units: multiple habitats on the farm; temporal units across months (leafarea and floralunits) and seasons (seeds) within 2007–2008.

- Data availability and usage
  - Datasets are prepared for standardised analysis and can be stored/uploaded to appropriate portals; underlying data intended to support environmental-health-like monitoring and evaluation of ecological networks and farm-management impacts.
