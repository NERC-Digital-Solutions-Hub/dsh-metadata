## Overview
- Describes the Norwood Farm study site and the data-driven construction of multiple ecological interaction networks at farm scale.
- Builds seven networks by combining field data with literature-derived information to express species interactions in farm-abundance units.
- Covers field data from 2007 and 2008, with outputs referenced in the main paper's figure.

## Study site and habitat characterization
- Norwood Farm, Somerset, UK: 125 hectares, 10 defined habitats based on vegetation (e.g., cereal, ley, lucerne; hedges; woodland; margins).
- Management: organic since 1990, with agri-environment schemes (Countryside Stewardship and Organic Entry Level Stewardship) and voluntary enhancements (field margins, hedges, low-intensity farming).
- Habitat area changes between the two years due to management; GIS used to map habitats and calculate areas.
- Habitat-level abundance data scaled to farm extent to produce farm-wide networks.

## Data collection and measurements
- Vegetation quantification: species-specific leaf area index (LAI) across habitats; herbaceous and woody vegetation measured via transects, canopy measurements, and literature-based leaf-area relationships.
- Floral resources: flowers counted as floral units along transects; transect lengths varied by year (2007: 25×1 m; 2008: 50×1 m).
- Seeds: soil-surface seeds sampled via suction methods; dry-weighted and weighed; seeds identified by specialists.
- Across habitats and months: data aggregated to farm totals, with sampling periods defined (fig. S1).

## Network construction and scaling
- Primary aim: express all species and interactions on the farm in a common abundance unit, summing across habitats and sampling periods.
- Networks (7 total) constructed for 2007 and 2008 using field data or literature-based interaction strengths, with farm-scale aggregation.
- Scaling and aggregation methods:
  - Abundances scaled to farm level by habitat area; sums across habitats and months (insects/flowers: monthly sums; vertebrates: sums across August and November).
  - Some interactions inferred from literature or indirect measurements (e.g., nectar plant associations for pollinators; literature-derived interaction strengths for some taxa).
  - Interaction networks illustrated in main text Figure 1.
- Specific networks:
  - Network 1: Flower-flower visitor network — field-derived nectar visitors captured on transects; densities scaled to farm area; total farm totals computed and averaged across years.
  - Network 2: Flower-butterfly network — twice-monthly butterfly transects; butterflies assigned to nectar plants by habitat-month abundances; scaled to farm totals.
  - Network 3: Plant-Leaf-miner parasitoid network — leaf miner sampling with rearing of parasitoids; combined miners from different host plants due to time constraints; parasitoids treated as generalists where appropriate.
  - Network 4: Plant-aphid-parasitoid network — aphids and parasitoids sampled in 2008; mummy parasitoids reared to host aphids; secondary parasitoids assigned to hosts due to generalization.
  - Network 5: Seed-Seed-feeding invertebrate-parasitoid network — seeds collected from selected plant groups; released insects reared to identify seed-feeders and parasitoids; interactions inferred from rearing outcomes.
  - Network 6: Seed-seed-feeding rodent-ectoparasite network — rodent abundances from capture-recapture models; seed abundances per habitat; frequency-dependent foraging to allocate seed consumption; ectoparasites counted per rodent and scaled up.
  - Network 7: Seed-seed-feeding bird network — granivorous birds surveyed; seeds assigned to birds based on energy content; habitat-wide estimates used due to birds’ landscape-scale movements; energy-based allocation used to handle seed size variability.

## Data sources, quality, and assumptions
- Combines:
  - Direct field measurements (vegetation, floral units, seeds, insect surveys, vertebrate counts).
  - Literature-derived nectar sources, seed preferences, and trophic interactions.
  - Rearing experiments for some parasitoids and seed-feeders.
- Handling of data gaps and constraints:
  - 2007 leaf-miner parasitoid identifications limited; miners from different hosts were pooled in some analyses.
  - Birds’ observed habitats vs. feeding movements acknowledged; methods applied to whole-farm estimates with some habitat-specific adjustments.
  - For some plant-insect links, energy content used as a proxy for interaction strength due to variation in handling times and seed sizes.
- Temporal scope: networks constructed for 2007 and 2008; final aggregation across years used to generate farm-scale summaries.

## Outputs and outputs accessibility
- Outputs organized as multiple farm-scale networks (1–7) representing different trophic linkages.
- Final networks and their interpretations referenced in the main article (Figure 1).
- Supporting materials include Table S1 (habitat descriptions and area data) and Figure S1 (sampling timeline).

## Takeaways for data support and reuse
- Demonstrates a comprehensive, multi-taxa data integration pipeline to build cross-trophic networks at a farm scale.
- Illustrates methods for scaling local field data to site-wide abstractions while transparently documenting assumptions and time-constraint adaptations.
- Highlights the importance of combining direct measurements with literature-based data to fill gaps in interaction strengths.
- Emphasizes meticulous documentation of habitats, sampling schemes, and temporal coverage to enable reproducibility and future re-use.
