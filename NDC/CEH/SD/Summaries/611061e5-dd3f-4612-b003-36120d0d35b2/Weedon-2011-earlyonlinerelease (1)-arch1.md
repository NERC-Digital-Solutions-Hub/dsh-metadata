# The WATCH Forcing Data 1958-2001: a meteorological forcing dataset for land surface- and hydrological-models

- Overview of basins and variables
  - Presents basin-level statistics for PET rc (Penman–Monteith) and PET PT (Priestley–Taylor), plus key meteorological drivers (Net Radiation, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, Precipitation) across multiple time intervals: 1901–1957, 1958–2001, and 1979–2001.
  - Each basin table includes the average (mm/yr or W/m^2 as appropriate), the annual slope (units/yr) with its min/max range, Neff (effective sample size), and an Adjusted Slope P value indicating statistical significance.

- Appendix: ERA-40 basis years order
  - Documents the sequence and mapping of ERA-40 basis years used to construct the WATCH Forcing Data for 1901–1957, illustrating the data-shuffling approach (e.g., WFD, 1 = ERA-40, WFD, 2 = WFD, etc.) to preserve diurnal-to-seasonal statistics and interannual variability.
  - Provides the year-by-year basis year assignments (e.g., 1901 basis years mapped to specific ERA-40 years like 1974, 1920, 1984, etc.), underscoring methodological details behind the 1901–1957 data generation.

- Key implications for analysts
  - PET rc and PET PT offer complementary evaporation perspectives, with PET PT often showing more pronounced long-term trends in some basins.
  - Regional precipitation signals are highly variable; some basins show increasing rainfall over certain periods, while others decline, complicating broad regional inferences.
  - Data quality and significance vary by basin and variable period; several slopes are not statistically significant after adjustment, and pre-1958 data carry additional uncertainties due to ERA-40 reliance and bias corrections.
  - The dataset remains valuable for multi-model comparisons and climate-impact studies, but basin-specific interpretations should account for data coverage gaps (notably Murray-Darling) and the coarse spatial resolution relative to flux-tower scales.
