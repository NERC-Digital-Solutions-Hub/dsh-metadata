# WATCH Forcing Data and its use to assess global and regional reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century.

## Overview
- Describes the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD), a half-degree global meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models across the 20th century.
- Aims to preserve diurnal cycles and support analysis of external drivers of evaporation, soil moisture, and runoff.
- Two time periods:
  - 1958–2001: bias-corrected ERA-40–based data (core WFD).
  - 1901–1957: data generated by re-ordering ERA-40 years to mimic late-20th-century statistics.

## Data content and structure
- Regularly gridded meteorological forcing variables at 0.5° resolution:
  - Wind speed at 10 m, temperature at 2 m, surface pressure, specific humidity at 2 m, downward longwave and shortwave radiation, rainfall rate, snowfall rate.
- Global land points: 67,420 grid cells (Antarctic excluded; CRU land–sea mask used).
- Temporal framework:
  - 1958–2001: 3-hourly time steps for radiation and precipitation-related variables; 6-hourly storage for some variables with interpolation to 3-hourly.
  - 1901–1957: data created by random ordering of ERA-40 years to match 1958–2001 statistics globally; continuity with leap years preserved.

## Data generation and corrections
- 1958–2001 (core WFD)
  - Base: ERA-40 reanalysis surface variables.
  - Corrections:
    - Temperature, surface pressure, and specific humidity bias-corrected against CRU observations; elevation corrections applied.
    - Downward longwave radiation not bias-corrected against SRB; kept consistent with ERA-40.
    - Downward shortwave radiation corrected for cloud cover and aerosols using HadGEM2-A 20th-century AOD; aerosols represented for clear and cloudy skies.
  - Precipitation processing (rainfall and snowfall): six-step approach ensuring spatial coherence of large-scale events; wet-day adjustments to CRU/GPCC benchmarks; outlier handling.

- 1901–1957 (early century WFD)
  - Approach: random ERA-40 years assigned to 1901–1957 years with constraints to match 1958–2001 statistics; same post-processing steps where possible.
  - Challenges: sparse gauge coverage prior to 1950; CRU substituted climatological values in data-sparse regions.
  - Year-end discontinuities removed with ramping for key variables to ensure smooth transitions between years; precipitation corrections preserved.

## Estimation of reference crop evaporation (PET)
- Two PET formulations are compared:
  - PET_rc (Penman–Monteith reference crop evapotranspiration): fixed reference crop resistances; aerodynamic resistance depends on 2 m wind speed; accounts for vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and net energy input.
  - PET_PT (Priestley–Taylor PET): radiation-based; VPD-independent; assumes well-watered conditions.
- PET_rc and PET_PT are converted to equivalent depth of evaporated water (mm/yr) for comparison with model outputs.
- Emphasizes how PET method choice influences interpretation of potential evaporation, especially in humid vs. arid regions.

## Validation and data quality
- Validation against FluxNet across seven sites shows:
  - Good agreement for temperature, downward longwave, and downward shortwave radiation (strong correlations).
  - Precipitation comparisons more variable; weaker correlations at sub-daily scales; better agreement at daily/monthly scales.
  - Global diurnal coherence of precipitation events is preserved, though tropical regions remain challenging due to very wet or very dry days.
- Quantitative metrics indicate reasonable performance for many variables, with larger discrepancies for precipitation and some near-surface variables in complex terrains.

## Global and regional trends and basins
- Global trends (1958–2001)
  - PET_rc: no significant global trend; VPD tends to rise; net radiation and wind speed tend to decrease; 2 m temperature increases.
  - PET_PT can differ locally by large margins (up to ~1000 mm/yr in some regions), highlighting PET-method sensitivity.
- Regional basins (eight large river basins highlighted)
  - Basins show diverse behavior; some regions exhibit varying precipitation, VPD, wind, and PET trends; high-latitude basins show strong interannual variability due to snow vs. rain components.
  - Examples indicate relative differences between PET_rc and PET_PT interpretations due to aridity/humidty and regional meteorology.
- Precipitation and snowfall
  - 1958–2001: no clear global land precipitation trend; regional signals exist and depend on gauge coverage and regional climate.
  - Basin-specific results are mixed, with some basins showing declines or increases in precipitation depending on period/region; snow contributions are variable in high latitudes.

## Limitations and caveats
- Early period challenges (1901–1957)
  - Limited interannual decadal variability in PET_rc due to ERA-40 randomization and sparse observations.
  - CRU/GPCC sparsity introduces potential biases in trend analyses.
  - Year-end discontinuities, though mitigated, reflect data limitations in early ERA-40 reconstructions.
- ERA-40 biases
  - Known biases in surface pressure and precipitation in early periods affect VPD and PET calculations.
  - Sub-daily precipitation remains difficult to capture accurately, even with post-processing.
- Spatial/temporal resolution limits
  - Grid-box averages may smooth localized extremes; footprint differences exist between towers and grid cells in validation.

## Data governance, provenance, and use for Data Leaders
- Provenance and lineage
  - WFD integrates ERA-40 reanalysis with CRU, GPCC, and HadGEM2-A aerosol corrections; detailed documentation of corrections and bias adjustments.
  - Distinct regimes for 1958–2001 and 1901–1957 to preserve methodological integrity.
- Metadata and discoverability
  - Thorough methodological descriptions, validation results, and regional analyses enable traceability and reproducibility.
  - Outputs are designed to support land surface models (LSMs) and hydrological models (GHMs) with well-documented forcing variables and corrections.
- Implications for data strategy
  - Demonstrates robust data pipelines: multi-source integration, bias correction, validation, and transparent limitations.
  - Highlights the importance of documenting corrections, uncertainty, and regional caveats for reuse across networks and partners.
  - Emphasizes data discoverability, versioning, and governance to support cross-network collaboration and co-ownership.

## Key takeaways for Data Leaders
- The WATCH Forcing Data is a transparent, well-documented, and provenance-rich data product enabling credible hydrological and climate-related modeling across the 20th century.
- Strengths include rigorous bias corrections, independent validation, and explicit notes on limitations and uncertainties.
- Demonstrates a comprehensive data-system approach: multi-source integration, diurnal signal preservation, spatial coherence, and metadata-rich outputs suitable for cross-organizational use.
- Practical guidance for adopting similar data initiatives:
  - Define clear data lineage and reproducible processing steps.
  - Implement robust bias correction and validation against independent benchmarks.
  - Communicate limitations transparently, especially for historical periods with sparse observations.
  - Maintain structured metadata, versioning, and governance to enable cross-network collaboration and co-ownership.
