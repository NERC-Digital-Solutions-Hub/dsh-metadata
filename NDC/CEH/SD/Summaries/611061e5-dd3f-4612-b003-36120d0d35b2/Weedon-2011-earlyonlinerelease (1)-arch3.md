# Creation of the WATCHForcing Data and its use to assess global and regional reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century

## Appendix Table 1: The order of the ERA-40 basis years as used in the WATCH Forcing Data 1901-1957

- The table excerpt presents per-basin trend metrics for multiple forcing variables across historical periods, including 1901-1957 and 1958-2001, with some data also shown for 1979-2001.
- Variables tracked for each basin and period include:
  - PET_rc (reference crop evapotranspiration, mm/yr)
  - PET_PT (Priestley–Taylor PET, mm/yr)
  - Net Radiative Flux (Net Rad, W/m^2)
  - VPD (vapor pressure deficit, kPa)
  - Wind (m/s)
  - Rainfall and Precipitation (mm/yr)
  - Snowfall (mm/yr)
- For each variable and period, the table lists:
 - Average (mean value)
 - Slope (rate of change, units/yr)
 - Slope-min and Slope-max (range of the estimated trend)
 - Neff (effective sample size)
 - Adjusted Slope P (statistical significance, e.g., whether the trend is considered significant)

- Notes on data completeness
  - The excerpt includes several basins (e.g., Orange, Lena, Ganges-Brahmaputra) with detailed trend metrics; some entries (e.g., Murray-Darling) are incomplete in this excerpt.
  - Across basins, many variables show small-to-moderate trends with varying statistical significance (Adjusted Slope P values), highlighting spatial heterogeneity in long-term forcing trends.
- Appendix-year-basis-year ordering for ERA-40 (1901-1957)
  - The appendix lists the sequence of ERA-40 basis years used to compose the WATCH Forcing Data for the 1901-1957 period.
  - The WATCH Forcing Data uses a cycle of WFD and ERA-40 basis years (WFD, 1–5 interleaving ERA-40 and WFD), with each year in 1901-1957 tied to a specific basis year (e.g., 1901 mapped to 1974 in WFD-1; 1901 mapped to 1920 in WFD-2, etc.), illustrating the reconstructive approach used to fill data-poor periods by rotating basis years.
- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - The table exemplifies how long-term, multi-variable forcing data are compiled with explicit trend metrics to support environmental health monitoring, model intercomparison, and policy-relevant analyses.
  - Emphasizes the need for transparent metadata, explicit basis-year selection, and clear communication of period-specific uncertainties when using historical forcing data for monitoring and decision-making.
