# Ant-mediated seed dispersal and nest distribution across invaded and non-invaded sites

- Study scope and aim
  - Conducted across four sites in 2014 and 2015 to compare ant-mediated seed dispersal and nest distribution between invaded (Linepithema humile present) and non-invaded sites.
  - Aimed to monitor environmental processes linked to ant communities and seed dispersal using standardized, transparent data collection across sites.

- Study sites and invasion status
  - Site 1: Montilivi Campus — invaded
  - Site 2: Castell d'Aro — invaded
  - Site 3: Montilivi Campus — non-invaded
  - Site 4: Santuari dels Angels — non-invaded
  - Vegetation across sites includes open cork-oak secondary forest with Quercus and Pinus and herbaceous myrmecochorous species.

- Data and data handling
  - All data are RAW and unmodified raw observations from all trials.
  - Data files are structured with clear column definitions, enabling traceability and re-use.
  - Data are organized by experiment with explicit file naming for each data collection method.

- Experiment 1: Pitfall trapping (ant community composition)
  - Design: At each site, two 100 m transects with pitfall traps placed every 5 m (total per site not specified; traps left for 72 hours).
  - Process: Trapped ants identified to species where possible; used to determine species mean relative abundance.
  - Outputs: Species composition data per transect and site, enabling comparisons between invaded and non-invaded areas.
  - Data structure highlights: Collection location, date, transect/hub coding, and species count per sample.

- Experiment 1: Baiting (temporal shifts in ant activity)
  - Design: Ten baits per transect at 7:00, 11:00, 15:00, and 19:00 hours; ants collected after 1 hour and identified.
  - Process: Assessed presence/absence of ant species at baits across times of day.
  - Outputs: Temporal patterns of ant activity and composition at invaded vs non-invaded sites.
  - Data structure highlights: Collection date, regional code, period of day, and species presence/absence counts.

- Experiment 2: Seed removal (seed dispersal by ants)
  - Design: Ten seed hubs per site along transects; each hub with six seeds from two plant species (three seeds per species). Seeds accessible to ants but protected from larger fauna.
  - Process: Monitored seed removal at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 hours; repeated for six days with seeds rotated per hub.
  - Scope: 869 seeds total (439 in invaded hubs, 439 in non-invaded hubs) across four sites.
  - Outputs: Number of seeds removed per hub and time-to-removal, with plant species considered.
  - Data structure highlights: Hub location, invasion status, seed removals, plant species, elaiosome condition, and timing data.

- Experiment 2: Seed fate (post-removal outcomes)
  - Design: Seed fate assessment for two plant species with seeds placed near ant nests; seeds retrieved from nests and surrounding areas after 72 hours.
  - Process: Mapped outcomes including seeds retrieved from nests, retrieved from aboveground refuse piles, and seeds not found (fate unknown).
  - Outputs: Seed fate distribution relative to invaded vs non-invaded ant communities.
  - Data structure highlights: Plant species, nest ID, invasion status, counts of seeds removed/retrieved, and unknown fates.

- Experiment 3: Nest distribution (spatial nest patterns)
  - Design: Across each site, five randomly placed quadrats (each 30.25 m^2) with baited cards observed over 4 hours for 10 consecutive days.
  - Process: Recorded number of ant trails and nest presence/absence per card; used to estimate nest density and nest size via trail data.
  - Outputs: Spatial nest density estimates and trail-based nest size indicators for invaded vs non-invaded sites.
  - Data structure highlights: Grid ID, location, score data per Rows and Lines, and total active grid cells.

- Experiment 4: Seed fate in nests (depth and retrieval)
  - Design: At 20 nests per locality (invaded vs non-invaded), introduced 40 seeds per nest (20 Genista monspessulana, 20 Sarothamnus arboreus) near nest entrances.
  - Process: Monitored seed removal within 30 minutes, ensured seeds entered nests, checked for ejected seeds after 72 hours, and excavated nest areas to 10 cm to recover seeds.
  - Outputs: Data on seed uptake and fate by nest, including depth retrieval considerations.
  - Data structure highlights: Plant species, nest ID, ant community status, seeds removed, seeds retrieved (in nest and refuse piles), and unknown fates.

- Analytical relevance for environmental monitoring
  - Enables cross-site comparisons of ant community structure (invaded vs non-invaded) using standardized pitfall and baiting data.
  - Assesses how invasion status influences seed removal rates, seed fate, and potential impacts on plant dispersal and seed survival.
  - Provides spatially explicit nest distribution metrics and nest size estimates to inform habitat connectivity and ecosystem processes.
  - The RAW data organization supports reproducible analyses and integration into larger environmental monitoring frameworks.

- Data accessibility and format alignment with monitoring aims
  - Files are clearly named by experiment and data type to support traceability.
  - Data structures specify the variables captured, supporting standardized reporting and policy-relevant monitoring.
  - The multi-experiment approach aligns with the Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype by offering standardized outputs (maps, charts, and reports) and ensuring data storage and portal upload readiness.
