# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Purpose and context
  - Climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming for the next 20–30 years.
  - Established in 1998; upland moorland ecosystem dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather) with several accompanying species; humo-ferric podzol soil with variable horizons.

- Experimental design
  - Treatments: drought and warming, each with three replicate plots; plus three control plots (nine plots total) arranged in blocks.
  - Drought treatment: operated May–Sept (1999–2011); since 2012, Apr–Oct; reduces site rainfall by ~20% and excludes ~80% of rainfall during drought periods via retractable polyethylene roofs.
  - Warming treatment: retractable aluminum mesh curtains that reflect infrared radiation, reducing nighttime heat loss; rainfall reduction ~14% due to retraction lag; operation limited in high winds (>10 m s-1).
  - Treatment layout and timing details provided in tables and appendices.

- Climate and site data
  - On-site AWS meteorological data plus micro-meteorological plot data; site rainfall and rainfall chemistry; throughfall data; water table depth; soil respiration; trace gases (CH4, N2O); net ecosystem CO2 exchange; photosynthesis; vegetation biomass and chemistry; litterfall; root biomass; soil microbial biomass; nitrogen mineralisation; soil organic matter and carbon density; soil solution chemistry.
  - Data are collected at varying frequencies (daily, hourly, fortnightly, biweekly, monthly, yearly) and span 1998–present for many datasets, with some datasets ending earlier or having gaps.

- Data collection methods and datasets (highlights)
  - AWS meteorological data: multiple sensors (temperature, humidity, rainfall, radiation, PAR, wind, pressure); hourly/day data; sensors mounted on secure mast after 2007; quality checks via visual QC.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: soil/air temperature and soil moisture measured at multiple depths; high-frequency logging with daily updates.
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry: storage rain gauge (biweekly) for rainfall totals; Warren spring collectors for chemistry (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium) with lab analyses and QA.
  - Throughfall: plot-level rainfall collectors; data used to derive treatment-level rainfall adjustments; data exclusion and infill rules noted.
  - Water table depth: permeable tubes installed 2009; biweekly measurements with plot-specific maximum detectable depths.
  - Soil respiration: multi-method over time (CIRAS-2, LI-COR 8100, automated systems); collars installed in plots; hourly to daily campaigns; conversions to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1 using standardized factors.
  - Trace gases (CH4, N2O): static chamber measurements with gas sampling and GC analysis; legacy data processing notes.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): measurements 2002–2004 and 2011 with different chamber systems; adjustments for biomass differences using pin-point biomass data.
  - Photosynthesis: ambient measurements and response curves for Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, and Empetrum nigrum; PAR/CO2 variations; leaf-area considerations for three-dimension leaves.
  - Vegetation biomass (Pin-point): annual surveys (1998–2012) using three quadrats per plot and a 300-pin grid; conversion of pin hits to biomass using species-specific calibration factors.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from spectrometer data collected in 2001–2004.
  - Vegetation phenology and pathogens: shoot elongation, budburst, leaf counts, flowering, herbivory, fungal infection records.
  - Vegetation chemistry: elemental analyses (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg), lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates on green and senesced material.
  - Litterfall: monthly (1999–2002) with 12 collectors per plot; biomass conversion to g m-2 and subsequent C/N analyses.
  - Root biomass: multiple years with soil cores; methods adapted over time (manual sorting, sieving, WinRHIZO analysis).
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012) with DOC measurements and biomass calculations.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: paired soil cores (initial and final) with KCl extraction and ammonium/nitrate analysis.
  - SOM, SOC and bulk density: core-based SOM and SOC determinations; bulk density calculations and g m-2 conversions.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers; analysis of NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, and pH; sample handling and storage details.

- Data processing, quality and access
  - Data processing varies by dataset; older measurements sometimes documented with legacy practices; conversions between measurement units (e.g., CO2 flux units) provided (using ideal gas law-based conversions).
  - Quality control typically performed via basic visual checks; some data stored outside centralized portals; not all data (especially smaller or post-2015 datasets) stored in the EIDC.
  - Data access: contact CEH Bangor personnel (Sabine Reinsch; Bridget Emmett) for dataset details; data may be partly hosted by CEH Bangor and other portals.
  - Noted operational caveats: drought roofs refurbishment and 2016 non-operation; data gaps and potential infill in some years.

- Appendices and site layout
  - Appendix 1–3: detailed site and plot layouts, quadrat maps, and legend for plot measurements (e.g., LYS, PQ, SS codes).

- Implications for analyses
  - Rich, multi-decadal, multi-dataset climate manipulation dataset enabling correlations between atmospheric drivers, soil processes, plant physiology, and ecosystem carbon and nutrient fluxes.
  - Requires careful standardization across datasets, handling of gaps, and attention to changes in measurement techniques over time.
  - Provides locally relevant, high-resolution data at the plot and ecosystem scale, suitable for modeling correlations, trends, and predictive scenarios under climate change.
