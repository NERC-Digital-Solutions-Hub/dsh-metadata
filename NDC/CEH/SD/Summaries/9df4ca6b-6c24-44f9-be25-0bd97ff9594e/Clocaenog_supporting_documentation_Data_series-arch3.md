# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

## Overview
- Climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming conditions.
- Replicated treatments (drought, warming) plus controls across plots established in 1998 to reflect 20–30 year climate projections for upland moorland.
- Aimed at providing a comprehensive environmental health data package to scrutinise policy, monitor ecosystem responses, and inform future decisions.

## Site information and context
- Location and ecosystem: upland west Atlantic moorland in Clocaenog Forest; dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather) with Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum; humo-ferric podzol soil.
- Climate and soil baseline (site characteristics available): mean annual temperature ~8.0°C; mean control soil temperature ~7.5°C; mean annual rainfall ~1411–1411 mm; total N deposition ~20–25 kg N ha−1 yr−1; 53°03'19"N, 3°27'55"W coordinates.
- Experimental layout: 9 plots in total (3 warming, 3 drought, 3 controls) arranged in blocks to mirror shading effects; measurements span various years with ongoing data collection noted up to at least 2016.

## Climate change treatments
- Drought treatment
  - Timing: typically May–September (1999–2011); from 2012, April–October.
  - Mechanism: retractable polyethylene roof over 4 m × 5 m plots triggered by rainfall sensors to exclude ~80% of rainfall, reducing about 20% of annual rainfall.
  - Wind considerations: curtains do not operate in winds >10 m s−1 to avoid damage.
- Warming treatment
  - Timing and mechanism: retractable aluminum mesh curtains that reflect infrared radiation, reducing nighttime heat loss; roof retracted during rain to preserve rainfall; operates based on light and rain sensors.
  - Effect on rainfall: about a 14% reduction in annual rainfall due to retraction after rain events.
- Replication and controls: 9 plots total with 3 warming, 3 drought, and 3 control plots; controls designed with scaffolding to mirror shading effects of treatment apparatus.

## Data collection, equipment, and methodology
- Data infrastructure
  - On-site automated weather station (AWS) and a range of plot-based sensors (micro-met data) plus various abiotic/biotic measurements.
  - Data covering multiple data streams with varying time scales and periods; some data are legacy, and not all are stored in the EIDC.
- Data streams and data processing notes
  - AWS meteorological data: minute-level measurements, reported as hourly averages; quality checks performed in Excel; long-running daily data (1999–present).
  - Micro-meteorological data: plot-level soil and air temperature, soil moisture; continuous measurements since 1998; logging formats changed over time (hourly to half-hour after 2016).
  - Rainfall: storage rain gauge (site level) and biweekly rainfall chemistry samples; throughfall data collected biweekly and used to derive plot-level rainfall by applying percent reductions to site rainfall.
  - Water table depth: measured biweekly from 2009 onward using permeable tubes; maximum detectable depths recorded per plot.
  - Soil respiration and trace gases: soil CO2 efflux measured with various systems (CIRAS-2, LI-COR 8100, automated collars); trace gases CH4 and N2O measured with static chambers; standardization and unit conversions described.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): measured in selected years (2002–2004, 2011) with different chamber setups; biomass adjustments applied to flux measurements.
  - Photosynthesis: ambient and response-curve measurements (PAR and Ci) for several plant species; detailed in two datasets (ambient and response curves) with species-level leaf measurements.
  - Vegetation biomass (Pin Point method): annual surveys (1998–2012, and beyond) using 3 quadrats per plot and a 300-pin grid; pins converted to biomass via species-specific calibration; destructively measured samples used to calibrate biomass conversions.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometer measurements in 2001–2004.
  - Vegetation phenology and pathogens: shoot elongation, budburst, leaves, herbivory, and pathogen incidence recorded for 1999–2009, across Calluna, Vaccinium and Empetrum.
  - Vegetation chemistry: elemental analysis (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates) on green and senesced material.
  - Litterfall: collectors deployed; monthly collection 1999–2002, with less frequent sampling thereafter; litter weighed and carbon/nitrogen analyzed.
  - Root biomass: multiple methods across years (2003–2011) including soil cores and WinRHIZO analysis; separate handling for organic vs inorganic horizons.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation method (2000–2001, 2012) with DOC measurements; microbial biomass calculated as DOC difference with an applied correction factor.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: soil-core incubations (1998–2004) with NO3− and NH4+ analysis to compute net mineralisation rates.
  - SOM, SOC, and bulk density: analyses on cores used for nitrogen mineralisation; SOM and SOC conversion through standard soil thermochemical steps; bulk density calculated from core volume and weight.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers (1998 onward); analysis of pH, NO3−, Cl−, SO4^2−, DOC; samples stored at 4°C prior to analysis.
- Data processing notes and accessibility
  - Various legacy data processing steps documented (and in some cases not fully in line with current best practices); some data not stored in the central data repository (EIDC); data availability and further details available from CEH Bangor contacts.

## Data accessibility and governance
- Primary contacts for data details: Sabine Reinsch (sabrei@ceh.ac.uk) and Bridget Emmett (bae@ceh.ac.uk) at CEH Bangor.
- Data provenance: authored by Alwyn Sowerby; edited by Sabine Reinsch; versioned as version 6 (04/11/2016) with updates to treatment information and page numbering.
- Governance considerations: tension between publicly sharing underlying data and data usefulness; data quality checks performed locally; long-term data stewardship and metadata completeness noted as ongoing concerns for some datasets.
