# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- The Clocaenog field site is a climate-change manipulation experiment in upland moorland, using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming over the next 20–30 years. It is powered by solar and wind, established in 1998, and features replicated drought and warming treatments.
- Experimental design: 9 plots in total (3 warming, 3 drought, 3 controls) across 3 blocks, each plot measuring 4 m x 5 m. Drought and warming treatments have dedicated replicates; control plots include scaffolding to mirror shading effects. The drought timing and duration have varied over the years (May–Sept traditionally; since 2012 April–October). Treatments are paused during high winds (>10 m/s) to protect curtains.
- Spatial and data layout: Appendix includes detailed site layout and quadrat arrangements. Grid references and site metadata are provided for replication and cross-site integration.

- Timeframe and data availability: Data collection spans 1999–2016 (with various fields active at different times); some data types extend beyond 2016 or are stored outside the central data portal. Not all data are currently stored in the EIDC (environmental data integrator); contact points are given for access and details.

- Data governance and custodianship:
  - Primary data are collected through an on-site automated weather station (AWS) and multiple plot-based sensors.
  - Key contacts for data details and access: Sabine Reinsch and Bridget Emmett (CEH Bangor).

- Data types and sources (overview of data assets):
  - AWS meteorological data: daily measurements of temperature, humidity, rainfall, air pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind speed/direction; data from 1999–present.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: plot-scale soil temperature, soil moisture; high-frequency (minute) measurements; data logged as hourly (pre-2016) and half-hourly (2016 onward).
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry: storage rain gauge (biweekly sampling) and Warren spring collectors for chemistry; pH, nitrate, chloride, sulfate, DOC, ammonium analyses described.
  - Throughfall data: plot-level rainfall collected biweekly; used to derive treatment-specific rainfall changes; data quality dependent on sampler integrity.
  - Water table depth: biweekly measurements from 2009 onward using permeable tubes; maximum detectable depths per plot recorded.
  - Soil respiration: fortnightly measurements using collars; methodological changes over time (CIRAS/EGM, LI-COR systems); data converted to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1; automated campaigns introduced in 2013–2014.
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): static chamber method; gas sampling at 0, 15, and 30 minutes; analyzed via gas chromatography.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): measured in 2002–2004 and 2011 with CIRAS/LI-COR systems; biomass-based adjustments applied to fluxes.
  - Photosynthesis: ambient measurements and response curves (2001–2007); two plant species studied; leaf area not directly measured; calibration and data caveats noted.
  - Vegetation survey data (pin-point biomass): yearly surveys (1998–2012) using a 3-quadrat, 100-pin grid; conversion from pin hits to biomass using species-specific calibration; data adjusted for missing pins.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometry (2001–2004).
  - Vegetation phenology and pathogen assessment: spring phenology, shoot elongation, budburst, herbivory, and fungal infection observations (1999–2009).
  - Vegetation chemistry: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates (green and litterfall material).
  - Litterfall: monthly to yearly collection (1999–2002; later intervals less frequent); conversion to litter mass (g m-2) and analysis of carbon and nitrogen.
  - Root biomass: multiple methods across years (2003–2013), including soil cores and root extraction; depth-specific analyses.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation methods (2000, 2001, 2012) with DOC measurements and corrections to microbial biomass C.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: soil-core incubation experiments (1998–2004) to derive ammonium and nitrate fluxes.
  - SOM, SOC and bulk density: soil core analyses to derive soil organic matter, soil organic carbon, and bulk density; results converted to g m-2.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers (1998 onward); pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC measured; samples stored and analyzed using standard instruments.

- Data processing and metadata notes:
  - Multiple data streams involve different instruments and units; explicit conversion factors and methodology are documented (e.g., CO2 flux conversions between g CO2 m-2 h-1 and mg CO2-C m-2 h-1, and µmol m-2 s-1 to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1).
  - Canopy reflectance and vegetation metrics rely on calibration factors (e.g., pin-hit to biomass conversion tables) derived from destructive sampling and calibration campaigns.
  - Legacy data quality: some datasets are described as legacy with incomplete or non-standard documentation; current best practices may not have been followed at the time of collection.
  - Data quality control: basic visual QC in Excel used across datasets; some datasets lacked automated data-validation rules; data gaps and potential inconsistencies are acknowledged.

- Data accessibility and dissemination:
  - Not all data are stored in the EIDC; larger and frequently updated datasets are available, while smaller or post-2015 datasets may reside elsewhere or require direct contact with data custodians.
  - Documentation includes detailed tables of data types, methods, time scales, and measurement frequencies to aid data discovery and reuse.

- Appendices and site context:
  - Appendix 1: Site layout and plot/quadrat configuration.
  - Appendix 2: Quadrat layout and plotting references (e.g., LYS, PQ codes).
  - Appendix 3: Plot layout with quadrats and measurement areas.

- Key takeaway for data leadership:
  - The Climoor dataset represents a rich, multi-sensor, long-term ecological data resource with diverse data streams spanning meteorology, hydrology, soil processes, vegetation dynamics, and biogeochemistry.
  - Effective data stewardship requires harmonizing metadata, ensuring consistent documentation across legacy and new data, integrating legacy datasets with modern repositories (like EIDC), and establishing standardized data processing pipelines and provenance trails.
  - Given scattered data storage and varying data quality, a centralized metadata catalog and clear access protocols would enhance discoverability and reuse for internal teams and external partners.
