# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

## Overview
- Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming for the next 20–30 years.
- The site is upland moorland dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather), with a diverse plant community and humo-ferric podzol soil.
- The project runs replicated drought and warming treatments with control plots to mirror shading effects from the experimental structures.

## Site context
- Location: Clocaenog Forest, Wales (53°03′19″N, 3°27′55″W); typical wet upland heath ecosystem.
- Vegetation: Heather-dominated with Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum, and other species; bryophytes present.
- Soils: Humo-ferric podzol with variable eluvial (E) and illuvial (Bh) horizons; soil depth and horizon presence vary across plots.
- Climate baseline: Historical climate data and site-specific characteristics (mean temp ~8.0°C; mean control soil temp ~7.5°C; mean annual rainfall ~1411 mm).

## Climate change treatments
- Treatments and replication: Two climate treatments (drought and warming) each with three replicate plots (4 m × 5 m) plus three control plots to mirror shading (total n=9 plots).
- Drought treatment:
  - Timing: May–September (1999–2011); since 2012, April–October.
  - Mechanism: Retractable polyethylene roof triggered by tipping-bucket rainfall sensor; reduces annual rainfall by ~20% (and ~80% of rainfall during drought periods due to sensor thresholding).
  - Wind constraint: Curtains do not operate in winds >10 m/s to prevent damage.
- Warming treatment:
  - Mechanism: Retractable aluminum mesh curtains that reflect infrared radiation, reducing nighttime heat loss (~64% reduction) and keeping nocturnal warming.
  - Rainfall interaction: Roof retracts during rain to minimize rainfall exclusion; overall ~14% reduction in annual rainfall.
  - Wind constraint: Curtains also avoid operation in high winds.
- Temporal details: Robust year-by-year treatment timing and reductions (data summarized from 1997–2016; 2016 drought operation not in use due to refurbishment).

## Experimental design and layout
- Plots and blocks: 9 plots arranged to compare warming (W), drought (D), and control (C) across three blocks; each treatment replicated thrice and controls mirrored shading.
- Appendix references: Site and plot layouts provided; quadrat layouts indicating where measurements occur.

## Data types and data collection
- On-site instrumentation and data streams:
  - AWS meteorological data: Temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, air pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind speed/direction; daily data from 1999–present.
  - Micro-meteorological data: Plot-level soil temperature, soil moisture (5–20 cm depth), daily to sub-daily resolution (recently half-hourly after 2016).
  - Rainfall and chemistry: Ground-based storage rain gauge (biweekly rain collection) and rainfall chemistry (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium).
  - Throughfall: Plot-level rainfall captured biweekly and used to adjust to plot-level equivalents.
  - Water table depth: Permeable tubes installed in 2009 with biweekly manual readings.
  - Soil respiration: CO2 efflux measured with collars (various systems used over time); 1999 onward with a mix of CIRAS-2, LI-COR, and automated LI-8100 setups; data converted to mg CO2-C m^-2 h^-1.
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): Measured with static chambers and GC analysis; sampling at 0, 15, and 30 minutes.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): Measured in selected years (2002–2004, 2011; later equipment changes required adjustments for biomass).
  - Photosynthesis: Ambient measurements and response curves (A-Ci and PAR response) for Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, and Empetrum nigrum; routine ambient measurements 2001–2003 with select years.
  - Vegetation biomass and structure: Pin-point canopy analysis (1998–2012 with annual measurements); biomass calibration using destructive sampling and species-specific conversion factors.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometry (2001–2004).
  - Phenology, growth, and pathogens: Shoot elongation, phenophases, leaf counts, and pathogen signs (e.g., rust) across key species; annual growth measurements.
  - Vegetation chemistry: Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates (green and senesced material).
  - Litterfall: Monthly (1999–2002) then less frequent collection with standardization to g m^-2.
  - Root biomass: Soil cores across multiple years (2003, 2004, 2008, 2011) with various extraction methods.
  - Soil microbial biomass: Chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012).
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: Soil core incubations with NH4+-N and NO3−-N analysis (1998–2004).
  - SOM, SOC, and bulk density: Soil cores from N-mineralisation studies; sub-sampling and thermal/gravimetric analyses; conversion to g m^-2.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: Lysimeters and tensioned samplers (biweekly sampling; pH, NO3−, Cl−, SO4^2−, DOC, NH4+ analysis).
- Data storage and access: Most data stored in the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) or CEH Bangor data systems; some infrequently collected datasets and post-2015 data may reside outside EIDC. Contacts for data access: Sabine Reinsch and Bridget Emmett (CEH Bangor).

## Data processing and quality assurance
- Data processing:
  - Standardization across measurement types (e.g., converting soil respiration flux units to mg CO2-C m^-2 h^-1; NEP/NEE conversions).
  - Throughfall adjustments: Plot-level rainfall derived by applying percent differences from throughfall to site rainfall data; excluded plots with data gaps.
  - Pin-point biomass conversion: Rarely missing pins corrected by scale factors; species- and life-form-specific biomass calibration factors derived from destructive sampling.
- Quality considerations:
  - Data processing notes acknowledge legacy practices and varying documentation quality across trace gas and some older datasets.
  - Revisions included updates to treatment information and page numbering in later version.
