# Faecal bacteria concentration in the River Wharfe from 2019 to 2021

## Overview
- Dataset documenting concentrations of faecal bacteria (total coliforms, E. coli, and intestinal enterococci) in River Wharfe and selected tributaries.
- Units: colony forming units (cfu) per 100 ml.
- Purpose: raise awareness of faecal pollution, identify sources (treated/untreated effluent, upstream inputs), and support policy designation efforts.

## Data Parameters and Structure
- Parameters: TC, E. coli, IE concentrations (cfu/100 ml).
- Sampling sites: located along the River Wharfe from headwaters near Oughtershaw to the River Ouse junction at Cawood; sites include main river and tributaries, focusing on recreational hotspots and potential pollution sources.
- Data columns (structure): site name, site type, latitude, longitude; proxy sites (downstream locations assumed to reflect upstream conditions); sample codes for projects.
- Projects and sample codes:
  - iWharfe2020 (iW_20)
  - iWharfe_Upper (iW_Upp)
  - iWharfe2021 (iW_21)
  - Wharfe Addingham Environment Group (AEG)
  - Wharfe Ashlands (Ashlands)

## Sampling Details
- Timeframe: April 2019 to September 2021 (irregular sampling intervals).
- Site selection: near STW discharges (Ilkley) and upstream/downstream of inputs; some samples taken at nearby or proxy sites.
- Sampling events: occasional duplicates (Primary 'P' and Duplicate 'D'); one instance of a trampling-related sample (TS).
- Collection method: field samples collected by trained volunteers (~350 ml) using sterile bottles; direct collection by wading or using a weighted rope for higher flow.
- Sample handling: samples kept in a cool bag with ice, transported to ALS Ltd laboratory in Coventry for analysis; analysis started within 24 hours of collection.

## Laboratory Analysis and Protocols
- Analysis approach: standard dilution, incubation, and counting methods.
- Protocols: available on the ALS Ltd website.
- Output: quantified concentrations of TC, E. coli, and IE per 100 ml.

## Data Quality, Management, and Access
- Data handling: data collected to raise awareness of faecal pollution and identify sources; organized across multiple projects with overlapping sites.
- Data management goals: verify, QA, clean, and transform data; store datasets appropriately and upload to relevant portals.
- Accessibility: designed to enable sharing and reuse of underlying data to support monitoring and policy activities.

## Purpose, Impact, and Usage
- Awareness and advocacy: supported local stakeholder engagement (Ilkley Clean River Group).
- Policy impact: contributed to Defra designation of the River Wharfe in Ilkley as an official Bathing Water site (first running water designation in the UK).
- Role of contributors: project design, field sampling coordination, laboratory transport, data interpretation, and data management.

## Key Personnel
- Rick Battarbee: project design, field sampling organization, sample transport, data interpretation.
- Malcolm Secrett: field sampling organization, data management, data interpretation.
