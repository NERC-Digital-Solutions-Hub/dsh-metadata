# Faecal bacteria concentration in the River Wharfe from 2019 to 2021

## Overview
- Spreadsheet data on faecal bacteria concentrations (total coliforms TC, Escherichia coli E. coli, and Intestinal enterococci IE) in cfu/100 ml from River Wharfe and selected tributaries.
- Sampling period: April 2019 to September 2021 (irregular intervals).
- Sites mainly along the river upstream and downstream of Sewage Treatment Works (STWs) in Ilkley, West Yorkshire; some datasets cover the full length of the River Wharfe.
- Sites listed downstream from the headwaters near Oughtershaw to the Wharfe–Ouse junction at Cawood.
- Purpose: raise awareness of faecal bacteria pollution and identify sources; contributed to Defra 2019 Bathing Water designation for the River Wharfe in Ilkley.

## Data structure and fields
- Columns include:
  - A: site name
  - B: site type (main river or tributary)
  - C: latitude
  - D: longitude
  - E: proxy site (when a nearby site is used as a proxy)
  - F–J: sample bottle codes for the projects
- Projects represented:
  - iWharfe2020 (code iW_20)
  - iWharfe_Upper (code iW_Upp)
  - iWharfe2021 (code iW_21)
  - Wharfe Addingham Environment Group (code AEG)
  - Wharfe Ashlands (code Ashlands)

## Sampling and analysis methods
- Field collection by trained volunteers using sterile 350 ml water bottles.
- Collection methods varied by flow:
  - Low flow: wading to collect ~350 ml at ~15 cm depth
  - High flow: bottle fastened to a weighted rope or dropped from river bank
- Samples kept in a cool bag with ice packs and transported overnight to the ALS Ltd laboratory in Coventry.
- Analysis began within 24 hours using standard dilution, incubation, and counting methods; protocols available on the ALS Ltd website.

## Locations and sampling design
- Sites are ordered downstream from Oughtershaw to the Wharfe–Ouse confluence at Cawood.
- Sampling targeted recreational hotspots or potential contamination sources (e.g., upstream/downstream of STWs or inflowing tributaries).
- Some samples (proxy sites) were taken at nearby locations where conditions were assumed equivalent.
- Some samples were duplicates (marked P for Primary, D for Duplicate) and occasionally trampling samples (TS).

## Data provenance, stewardship, and usage
- Project design and field sampling coordinated by Rick Battarbee; data management and interpretation supported by Malcolm Secrett.
- Data contributed to Ilkley Clean River Group’s Defra Bathing Water designation application (2019).
- Protocols and analytical methods are documented by ALS Ltd; the dataset comprises overlapping sites across multiple projects.
