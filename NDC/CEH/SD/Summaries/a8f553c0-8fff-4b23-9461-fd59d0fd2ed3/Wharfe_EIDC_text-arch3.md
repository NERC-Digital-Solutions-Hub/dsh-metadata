# Faecal bacteria concentration in the River Wharfe from 2019 to 2021

## Overview
- Dataset on faecal bacteria concentrations (total coliforms, E. coli, intestinal enterococci) in river water, measured as colony forming units per 100 ml (cfu/100 ml).
- Spans 2019–2021 for the River Wharfe and selected tributaries, with sites mainly upstream/downstream of Ilkley Sewage Treatment Works (STW) and various other sites along the river.
- Aimed to raise local awareness of pollution sources and support management actions, including Bathing Water designation.

## What the data contain
- Measurements for three faecal indicators: TC, E. coli, and IE.
- Location data: site name, site type (main river or tributary), latitude, longitude; some sites are proxy locations downstream where conditions are assumed similar.
- Project identifiers indicating the data’s origin: iWharfe2020, iWharfe_Upper, iWharfe2021, Wharfe Addingham Environment Group, Wharfe Ashlands.
- Column structure includes site details (A–E) and multiple project sample codes (F–J).

## Sampling sites and design
- Sites selected as recreational hotspots or to identify sources of faecal bacteria (e.g., upstream/downstream of final effluent pipes).
- Sites listed in downstream order from headwaters near Oughtershaw to the Wharfe–Ouse confluence at Cawood.
- Some samples taken at proxy sites downstream where conditions are comparable to upstream locations.
- Sampling occurred irregularly from April 2019 to September 2021.

## Data structure and codes
- Duplicate samples indicated: Primary (P) and Duplicate (D).
- One instance of a trampling (TS) sample where river bed sediment was re-suspended.
- Data collected by multiple projects, with overlapping sites.

## Field collection and laboratory analysis
- Field collection by trained volunteers using roughly 350 ml sterile bottles.
- Collection methods varied by flow: direct wading at shallow depth or a weighted rope technique for higher flow.
- Samples kept in a cool bag with ice packs and transported overnight to the ALS Ltd laboratory in Coventry.
- Analysis performed within 24 hours using standard dilution/incubation/counting methods; protocols available on the ALS Ltd website.

## Projects and data sources
- iWharfe2020 (sample code iW_20), iWharfe_Upper (iW_Upp), iWharfe2021 (iW_21), Wharfe Addingham Environment Group (AEG), Wharfe Ashlands (Ashlands).
- Field design and data interpretation coordinated by Rick Battarbee; data management and interpretation supported by Malcolm Secrett.

## Data provenance and governance
- Data generated to monitor faecal contamination and inform local water quality management.
- Methods, sampling design, and handling procedures documented; protocols publicly available via ALS Ltd.
- Data stewardship responsibilities noted (design, sampling coordination, transport, management, and interpretation).

## Purpose and usage
- Used to raise local awareness about pollution sources and to inform policy decisions related to water quality.
- Contributed to Defra’s designation of the River Wharfe in Ilkley as an official Bathing Water site—the first running water in the UK to receive this designation.
