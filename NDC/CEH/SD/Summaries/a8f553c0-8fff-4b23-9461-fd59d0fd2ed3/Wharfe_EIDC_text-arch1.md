# Faecal bacteria concentration in the River Wharfe from 2019 to 2021

## Overview
- Measurements of faecal bacteria concentrations in river water: total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and intestinal enterococci (IE), expressed as cfu per 100 ml.
- Samples collected from the River Wharfe and selected tributaries, mainly upstream and downstream of Ilkley Sewage Treatment Works (STW); some data from sites along the full river length.
- Site metadata: site name, type (main river or tributary), latitude, longitude; downstream site ordering from Oughtershaw to the Wharfe–Ouse junction at Cawood.
- Proxies: some samples taken at nearby downstream sites when direct site sampling wasn’t possible (column E, proxy sites).
- Project and sample codes (F–J):
  - iWharfe2020 (iW_20)
  - iWharfe_Upper (iW_Upp)
  - iWharfe2021 (iW_21)
  - Wharfe Addingham Environment Group (AEG)
  - Wharfe Ashlands (Ashlands)
- Sampling period: irregular intervals from April 2019 to September 2021; duplicates marked as Primary (P) and Duplicate (D); one trampling (TS) sample re-suspended sediment.
- Sample collection: trained volunteers collected ~350 ml water in sterile bottles; in low flow, collected by wading; in higher flow, bottles attached to weighted rope or swung from river bank.
- Sample handling: kept cool, transported overnight to ALS Ltd laboratory in Coventry; analysis began within 24 hours using standard dilution, incubation, and counting methods; protocols available on ALS Ltd website.

## Data collection design and scope
- Purpose: raise awareness of faecal bacteria pollution from treated and untreated effluent; identify additional upstream sources.
- Uses across projects to map pollution sources relative to recreational hotspots and STW outfalls.
- Cross-project overlap: multiple projects share sites, enabling broader spatial coverage but requiring harmonisation for combined analyses.

## Data provenance and management
- Key individuals: Rick Battarbee (design of the project, field sampling logistics, lab transport, data interpretation) and Malcolm Secrett (field sampling, data management, data interpretation).

## Uses, impact, and governance
- The dataset contributed to Defra in 2019 for designating the River Wharfe in Ilkley as an official Bathing Water site.
- Associated group: Ilkley Clean River Group, supporting local awareness and governance around water quality.

## Data notes and potential limitations
- Proxies are used when direct sites aren’t available.
- Sampling was irregular and includes duplicates and occasional special samples (TS).
- Data are generated by ALS Ltd with standard lab protocols; detailed protocols are publicly available.
- There may be site- and project-level differences that require careful harmonisation for joint analyses.

## Structure and accessibility cues
- Column designations (for reference): A = site name, B = site type, C = latitude, D = longitude, E = proxy site indicator, F–J = sample codes by project (iW_20, iW_Upp, iW_21, AEG, Ashlands).
- Spatial ordering follows downstream progression from headwaters near Oughtershaw to the Wharfe–Ouse junction at Cawood.
