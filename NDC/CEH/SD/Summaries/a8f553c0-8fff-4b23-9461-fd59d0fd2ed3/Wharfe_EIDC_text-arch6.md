# Faecal bacteria concentration in the River Wharfe from 2019 to 2021

## Overview
- Dataset recording concentrations of total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and intestinal enterococci (IE) in river water, expressed as colony forming units (cfu) per 100 ml.
- Samples collected 2019–2021 from the River Wharfe and selected tributaries, mainly upstream and downstream of Ilkley Sewage Treatment Works (STW).
- Aimed to raise awareness of faecal bacteria pollution and identify additional sources, including upstream inputs.

## Data scope and structure
- Sites listed in downstream order from the headwaters near Oughtershaw to the Wharfe–Ouse junction at Cawood.
- Columns:
  - A: site name
  - B: site type (main river or tributary)
  - C: latitude
  - D: longitude
  - E: proxy site (downstream site used when direct sampling location was not available)
- Project-specific sample codes:
  - F: iWharfe2020 (sample code iW_20)
  - G: iWharfe_Upper (sample code iW_Upp)
  - H: iWharfe2021 (sample code iW_21)
  - I: Wharfe Addingham Environment Group (sample code AEG)
  - J: Wharfe Ashlands (sample code Ashlands)
- Sampling occurred irregularly from April 2019 to September 2021; duplicates marked as Primary (P) or Duplicate (D); some samples labeled TS for trampling.
- Samples collected by trained volunteers using ~350 ml bottles; collection methods varied by flow conditions.

## Data collection and analysis
- Field samples collected with sterile bottles, transported in a cool bag with ice to a lab in Coventry (ALS Ltd) for analysis.
- Analysis began within 24 hours of collection using standard dilution, incubation, and counting methods; protocols available on the ALS Ltd website.

## Data content details and purpose
- Purpose: raise local awareness of faecal bacteria pollution from treated and untreated discharges (e.g., Ilkley STW) and identify upstream sources.
- Used by the Ilkley Clean River Group to support Defra’s 2019 Bathing Water designation for the River Wharfe in Ilkley (first running water Bathing Water designation in the UK).

## Roles and responsibilities
- Rick Battarbee: project design, field sampling, transport to laboratory, data interpretation.
- Malcolm Secrett: data management, field sampling, data interpretation.

## Data quality, challenges, and considerations
- Patchy, irregular sampling across multiple projects with overlapping sites.
- Some reliance on proxy sites; consistency across projects may vary.
- Managing data from volunteers and multiple sites requires careful QA and standardization.

## Potential data products and data-support opportunities
- Self-serve dashboards and pivot tables by site, project, and bacteria type (TC, E. coli, IE).
- Time-series visualizations to identify trends and potential correlations with upstream discharges.
- Geographic mapping of sampling sites with coordinates; data cleaning and standardization steps.
- Documentation of protocols and data provenance to support reuse and sharing.
- Clear communication materials to promote outputs and encourage reuse in local policy or community groups.

## Access, sharing, and governance considerations
- Data originates from volunteer-collected samples; consider licensing, attribution, and adherence to protocols (ALS method details).
- Ensure ongoing data stewardship, versioning, and alignment with project-specific codes and site metadata for re-use.
