# Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy Supporting documentation for data

## Overview and Aims
- International project (CINAg) to optimise farm practices and soil management for better nitrogen use and reduced Nr losses to the environment.
- Aims to develop novel indicators of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and holistic soil health metrics, test them in field experiments, and translate findings to Chinese farmers through established programmes.
- Four work packages (WP1–WP4) addressing fundamental N cycling, novel N technologies, improved agronomic practices, and predictive capacity/knowledge exchange.

## Project Structure and Work Packages
- WP1: Improved fundamental understanding of N cycling
- WP2: Harnessing novel N technologies
- WP3: Improved agronomic practices
- WP4: Predictive capacity and knowledge exchange

## Locations and Experiments

### Field platforms (UK-wide)
- Four farm platforms across the UK (2016–2017): North Wyke (NW, Devon), Harpenden (HA, Herefordshire), Henfaes (HF, North Wales), Easter Bush (EB, Scotland)
- 2016: Inorganic fertiliser trials on grassland
- 2017: Digestate trial on winter wheat; additional grass trials at EB and HA
- 2018: UK-wide soil sampling across nine sites with two or more land uses per site

### Details on platforms and conditions
- Site information covers soil types, textures, mean annual temperature, and precipitation.
- Experimental layouts varied by site and year, with subplots for NH3/N2O measurements, soil sampling, and biomass/yield assessments.
- 2018 site visits included diverse land uses (e.g., pristine, grazing, arable rotations, pasture).

## Meteorological Data
- NW and HF: daily rainfall and daily mean/min/max temperatures; soil moisture sensors at 2.5 cm depth for water-filled pore space (WFPS).
- EB: soil temperature and WFPS via handheld probes; long-term meteorological station for 30-minute interval measurements (air temp, soil temp, rainfall).

## Experimental Information and Designs

### 2016 Inorganic Fertiliser Experiments (Grass Trials)
- Complete randomized block design at NW and HF; four fertiliser treatments plus controls, each with four replicates.
- Treatments: Urea (U), Urea + urease inhibitor (IU), Ammonium-nitrate (AN), Control.
- Plot subdivision for NH3 emission measurements, soil/N2O sampling, and biomass harvest.
- EB (2016) also included inorganic fertiliser plots with digestate/different layouts.

### 2017 Digestate Experiment (Winter Wheat)
- Complete randomized block design at NW and HF; five replicates per digestate treatment (Digestate; Digestate + DMPP; Acidified Digestate; Acidified Digestate + DMPP; Control).
- Harvest subplots for biomass; sampling subplots for soil/biogeochemical analyses.
- Target N application rate via digestate around 190 kg N ha−1, with field-applied adjustments.

### UK-wide Sampling - 2018
- Sampling across nine sites with at least two land uses per site.
- Portions of the UGRASS network included; aboveground biomass measurements complemented by site-specific data.

## Protocols and Data Processing

- Protocols are separated for WP1 (fundamental soil/plant metrics) and WP2 (nitrogen technologies and dynamics); plots sampled the same day within a site, with timing adapted to weather and crop growth.
- Crops harvested after full growing season or peak biomass as advised by farm managers.

### Yields and Biomass (WP1/WP2 context)
- Grass yields: dry matter (t/ha), quality metrics (crude protein, ME, NDF, ADF, etc.), and digestibility.
- Wheat: grain and straw yields with moisture corrections; TGW (thousand-grain weight); quality and energy metrics.

### NUE and N Content
- Herbage N content, N offtake, and NUE (crops and grain) calculated from total N analyses and yields.
- EB site used Kjeldahl total N analysis for crop N content; NUE computed against total N applied.

### Greenhouse Gases: Ammonia and N2O
- NH3: wind-tunnel measurements (NW/HF) with acid traps and colorimetric analysis; 3–7 day sampling periods; cumulative emissions via area-under-curve methods.
- N2O: manual and/or automatic chambers across sites; flux calculations by standard equations; cumulative emissions assessed with time-series approaches (lognormal Bayesian framework for some sites).

### Soil Sampling and Nitrogen Metrics (WP1/WP2)
- Topsoil cores (0–15 cm) and deeper samples as needed; Nr (NH4+/NO3−) via KCl extraction; mineral N and organic N pools measured (amino acids, peptides, mineralisable N).
- DOC and TDN measured from K2SO4 extracts; DON inferred.
- Soil microbial biomass C and N (MBC/MBN) via chloroform fumigation; QA/QC with standards and replicates.

### Other Soil Chemical and Physical Properties
- Aggregate size distribution, soil texture (sand/silt/clay) via laser diffraction.
- Soil moisture, soil organic matter (LOI), pH, and electrical conductivity (EC).
- Base cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg) via ammonium acetate extraction and ICP-OES.
- Total soil C and N (elements) by elemental analysers; total P by digestion and colorimetry.
- POXC as a measure of active soil carbon.
- P fractions: CE extractable P (citric acid), Olsen-P, and acetic acid extractable P for plant-available pools.

### DNA, Genes, and Microbial Diversity
- Soil DNA extractions followed by qPCR targeting: nifH (nitrogen fixation), amoA (AOB/AOA nitrification), nirK/nirS and nosZ (denitrification), ureC (urease activity).
- 16S rRNA gene (bacteria/archaea) and ITS (fungal) amplicon sequencing for community composition.
- Diversity metrics (Shannon, richness) and OTU-based analyses; sequencing performed at partner labs with QA controls.

### Microbial Community and Soil Function Indices
- OTUs and microbial diversity indices computed; rarefaction used for diversity estimates.
- Spatial and temporal data integrated to relate microbial function to N cycling and soil health.

### Soil Water Dynamics
- Infiltration: Mini Disk Infiltrometer across sites; multiple tensions to derive hydraulic conductivity.
- Water release curves (HYPRO/HyProp approach) to model soil water retention and hydraulic parameters.

## Data Management, QA/QC, and Outputs

- Data managed in Microsoft Excel, LIMS, and project databases; cross-institution collaboration for QA/QC.
- Multiple laboratories contributed with standardized QA/QC protocols; use of reference standards and blanks for chemical analyses.
- Public outputs include project webpage and peer-reviewed publications detailing fertiliser comparisons and digestate processing, as well as advanced processing of digestate for nitrogen management.

## Data Reuse and Accessibility
- Data generated span agronomic yields, NUE metrics, greenhouse gas emissions, soil chemistry and physics, and microbial community data.
- Datasets are suitable for meta-analyses linking fertiliser type, digestate use, and soil health outcomes across UK platforms and UK-wide sites, with cross-reference to Chinese outreach via CAU/CAAS programs.
