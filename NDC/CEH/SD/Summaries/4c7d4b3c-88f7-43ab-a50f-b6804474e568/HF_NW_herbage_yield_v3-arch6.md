# HF_NW_herbage_yield.csv

## Overview
- Supplement detailing the data structure for the herbage yield dataset HF_NW_herbage_yield.csv.
- Part of supporting documentation for CINAg experiments; relates to data series in Supporting_documentation_CINAg_experiments_final_check_v2.1.pdf.
- Dataset comes from grassland fertiliser trials conducted in 2016 at two research stations: Henfaes Research Station (HF) and North Wyke Research Station (NW, Rothamsted Research).

## Dataset specifics
- Size: 7 columns and 96 rows.
- Content: Grassland fertiliser trial data from 2016 at HF and NW.

## Column definitions and units
- Date: Date of grass cut
- Site: HF | NW (trial location)
- N_app: 1 | 2 | 3 indicating fertiliser applications (1st & 2nd applications 90 kg ha-1; 3rd application 60 kg ha-1)
- Block: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 (randomised block design)
- Plot: 1 – 16 (the harvested plot); plot size 2 × 6 m
- Treatment: AN | U | IU | C (N fertiliser type)
  - AN = ammonium nitrate
  - U = urea
  - IU = inhibited urea (agrotain)
  - C = 0N control
- Dry_tonnes_ha: yield in dry weight basis (tonnes per hectare)

## Data provenance and context
- Derived from grassland fertiliser trials conducted in 2016 at HF and NW (Henfaes and North Wyke, respectively).
- The document serves as a data-structure reference to aid interpretation and subsequent analysis.
