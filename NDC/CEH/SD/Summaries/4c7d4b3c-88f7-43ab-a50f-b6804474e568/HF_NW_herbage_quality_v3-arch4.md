# Details of data structure to ' HF_NW_herbage_quality.csv '

- This document supplements the supporting documentation for data series described in Supporting_documentation_CINAg_experiments_final_check_v2.1.pdf.
- Dataset scope: 13 columns and 96 rows; herbage quality data from grassland fertiliser trials conducted in 2016 at Henfaes Research Station (Bangor University) and North Wyke Research Station (Rothamsted Research).
- Data provenance and processing:
  - Henfaes samples were pre-dried and sent to Sciantec Analytical (Stockbridge Technology Centre, Y08 3SD, UK).
  - North Wyke samples were from fresh material and sent to Trouw Nutrition GB, Blenheim House, Ashbourne, UK.
- Analytes measured (via near-infrared spectrometry):
  - Dry matter, ADF (acid-detergent fibre), Ash, Crude Protein, Metabolisable Energy (ME), Non-digestible Fibre (NDF).
- Digestibility metric:
  - D = ME/0.16
- Dataset structure: Column header → explanation; Unit provided.
- Column details:
  - Date: Date of grass cut
  - Site: HF|NW (HF = Henfaes, NW = North Wyke)
  - N_app: 1|2|3 denotes fertiliser application (1st & 2nd applications 90 kg ha-1, 3rd application 60 kg ha-1)
