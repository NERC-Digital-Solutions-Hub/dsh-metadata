# Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy Supporting documentation for data

- Aims and context
  - International CINAg project to optimise farm practices and soil management for better nitrogen use and reduced environmental Nr losses.
  - Objective to inform policy and future decisions through novel indicators and holistic soil-health metrics.

- Project structure and objectives
  - Four work packages:
    - WP1: Improved fundamental understanding of N cycling
    - WP2: Harnessing novel N technologies
    - WP3: Improved agronomic practices
    - WP4: Predictive capacity and knowledge exchange
  - Translate developments to Chinese farmers via the Science and Technology Backyard programme.

- Study sites and platforms
  - Four UK farm platforms (2016–2017):
    - North Wyke (NW) – Devon, Rothamsted-operated site
    - Harpenden (HA) – Herefordshire, Rothamsted-operated
    - Henfaes Farm (HF) – North Wales, Bangor University
    - Easter Bush (EB) – Edinburgh, CEH
  - 2018 UK-wide soil sampling across nine sites with multiple land uses (Scotland, Wales, England).

- Experimental designs
  - 2016 inorganic fertiliser grass trials across NW, HF, EB
    - Complete randomized blocks; treatments: Urea, Urea with inhibitor, Ammonium-nitrate, Control
    - Subplots for NH3 measurement, N2O measurement, and biomass yield/quality
  - 2017 digestate experiment on winter wheat (NW and HF; additional grass trials at EB and HA)
    - Complete randomized blocks; digestate with/without nitrification inhibitor and acidification; multiple control plots
    - Harvest and sampling subplots for yield, N metrics, and N2O measurements
  - 2018 UK-wide sampling
    - Soil and aboveground biomass measurements across diverse land uses

- Protocols and data processing
  - Clear separation of protocols for WP1 (soil and plant metrics) and WP2 (process measurements and treatment responses)
  - Sampling timing aligned with crop stages and management events; crops harvested at peak biomass
  - Platforms varied in layout across years; detailed tables and appendices document site-specific designs and timings

- Key measurements and indicators
  - Yields and quality (dry matter, CP, ME, N content, N offtake, NUEc, NUEg)
  - Nitrogen use efficiency calculations comparing treated vs. control plots
  - Greenhouse gases: ammonia emissions (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes (static and wind-tunnel methods; Bayesian and frequentist analyses)
  - Soil nitrogen metrics (NH4+, NO3-, amino acids, peptides, mineralisable N)
  - Soil organic matter, DOC/TDN, MBC/MBN
  - Soil physical/chemical properties: texture, moisture, pH, EC, base cations, total C and N, total P
  - Specialized soil P pools: Olsen-P, CEH citric acid extractable P, acetic acid extractable P
  - Microbial community analyses: DNA extractions, qPCR targets (nifH, amoA, nirK, nirS, nosZ, ureC), 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing, diversity indices
  - Soil structural/hydraulic metrics: aggregate size distribution, infiltration, soil water release curves
  - Meta- and model-ready data: standardized units, QA/QC steps, and documented protocols

- Data governance, sharing, and accessibility
  - Emphasis on data being open and shareable, with metadata added at source as needed
  - Data management and governance embedded in project outputs; underlying data intended for public sharing where appropriate
  - Outputs presented via reports, charts, dashboards, and policy-oriented summaries

- Challenges and considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - Common monitoring barriers identified: data gaps, limited access to data, organizational silos, need for public data sharing, keeping data current, inadequate metadata, data transformation workloads, and communicating complex results
  - Importance of establishing data governance to ensure data quality, accessibility, and timely updates
  - Necessity of translating complex scientific findings into actionable policy-relevant insights and indicators (e.g., NUE and holistic soil-health metrics)

- Outputs and publications
  - Project webpage: www.rothamsted.ac.uk/international/china/cinag
  - Notable publications deriving from the datasets:
    - Assessing the benefits and wider costs of different N fertilisers for grassland agriculture
    - Advanced processing of food waste-based digestate for mitigating nitrogen losses in a winter wheat crop

- Summary of relevance for monitoring framework authors
  - Demonstrates an integrated approach to measuring environmental health impacts of nitrogen management across multiple sites and years
  - Combines agronomic performance, soil health indicators, and greenhouse gas emissions into comprehensive NUE-focused metrics
  - Provides a structured data workflow, from field experiments and protocols to QA/QC and data sharing, suitable for informing monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation
  - Highlights governance and metadata challenges critical to open, trustworthy environmental monitoring datasets
