# Vegetation work

- Four quadrats of 50 cm x 50 cm placed randomly around the site to sample vegetation.
- Visual estimation of the percentage cover of each species within quadrats.
- Species richness and the percentage cover of grasses and forbs summed across the four quadrats.
- Biomass harvested by clipping at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80 °C for 24 hours, then weighed; site‑level biomass sum calculated as g biomass per m².
- Shannon’s Diversity index calculated as per Shannon & Weaver (1963).

## Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis and respiration

- Four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) installed in the soil; transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA) to measure CO2 flux.
- CO2 influx measured over two minutes; then a reflective cover placed to obtain dark efflux; measurements repeated.
- Simultaneous measurements of soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in triplicate.
- Raw CO2 measurements (ppm) over time processed to compute CO2 flux (mg m⁻² h⁻¹); calculations involve chamber volume, area, and standard gas constants.
- Additional data processing included variable X (time) to generate predicted CO2 values at start and after one hour for flux calculations.

## Methane (CH4), CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O)

- Chambers covered with reflective material; 9 mL air samples collected at 10, 20, and 30 minutes.
- Gas concentrations measured with a Gas Chromatograph (GC); final values calculated using the same methodology as IRGA-derived CO2 flux.

## Soil sampling

- Six soil samples collected per site using a 4 cm width auger to a depth of 10 cm.
- Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Bulk density

- Bulk density measured from two cores per site, separated into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths.
- Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving; BD calculated as mass per volume.

## pH

- pH measured by mixing 5 g soil with 5 g Milli-Q water (1:1) and using a Mettler Toledo pH meter with LE409 probe.

## Volumetric moisture content

- Fresh soil (5 ± 0.001 g) dried at 80 °C for 48 hours; moisture content calculated as dry weight proportion of wet weight.

## Water extractable N and C

- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 mL Milli-Q water, shaken for 1 hour, then filtered.
- Undiluted filtrate analysed for dissolved inorganic N (DIN: NH4+, NO3-, and total N) via autoanalyser; dissolved organic carbon (DOC) via TOC analyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using DIN/DOC mg/kg = (raw value × (water content + extract volume) × dilution factor) / dry soil weight.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation

- 5 g soil with 25 mL 1 M KCl shaken for 1 hour; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analysed for DIN (NH4+, NO3-) by autoanalyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture as above.
- Additional 5 g soil incubated at 25 °C for 14 days, then extracted and analysed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3⁺NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m⁻² d⁻¹).

## Microbial biomass

- Fumigation–extraction: 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform to lyse microbes for 24 hours; unfumigated control prepared.
- After fumigation, nutrients extracted with 25 mL 0.5 M K2SO4 and shaken; extracts analyzed via autoanalyser at appropriate dilutions.
- Dissolved carbon measured with TOC; results adjusted for water content.
- Microbial biomass determined using KE (killed extraction) and KEN (unextracted) correction quotients (0.35 and 0.54) to adjust extraction efficiency.
