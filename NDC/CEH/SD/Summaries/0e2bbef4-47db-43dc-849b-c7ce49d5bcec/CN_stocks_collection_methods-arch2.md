# Soil sampling

- Two soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width auger, as deep as possible.
- Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Retained stones weighed to determine gravel and chalk flints proportion.
- Soil cores split into 5 cm depth increments; dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Samples stored at 25 °C until ready for processing.

## Bulk density

- Soil weighed and bulk density (BD) calculated as mass/volume.
- BD adjusted for gravel using:
  - Adjusted BD = (unadjusted BD) × (100 − % gravel) / 100

## Carbon and nitrogen analysis

- Each depth fraction ground in a ball mill at 25 s⁻¹ for 2 minutes.
- Carbonates dissolved with 10% HCl in a dropwise process until effervescence ceased.
- Samples redried; 10 ± 0.5 mg used for combustion analysis.
- Analyses conducted with an Elementar vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).

## Quality control

- Standards and blanks run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser.
- 5% analytical replicates included.
