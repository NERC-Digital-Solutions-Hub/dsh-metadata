# Vegetation work

## Overview of data collected
- Vegetation metrics: species richness, percentage cover per species, and biomass per site.
- Gas flux measurements: net ecosystem CO2 exchange, CO2 flux (including photosynthesis and respiration) and CH4, CO2, N2O concentrations.
- Soil and extractable chemical properties: pH, volumetric moisture content, bulk density, water-extractable N and C (DIN, DOC), KCl extractable N (DIN NH4/NO3) and mineralisation.
- Microbial biomass: fumigated vs unfumigated extractable nutrients and dissolved carbon; extraction efficiency adjustments.

## Vegetation measurements
- Four quadrats, each 50 cm x 50 cm, placed randomly per site.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover by species; species richness and grasses/forbs cover summed across quadrats.
- Biomass: clipped at soil surface from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, weighed; summed to site level as g biomass per m^2.
- Diversity: Shannon–Weaver index calculated for community diversity.

## Gas exchange, photosynthesis, and related measurements
- CO2 flux and gas exchange: four plastic collars with transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA).
- Process: measure CO2 influx over 2 minutes; then cover chamber to obtain dark efflux; repeat measurements for soil moisture, temperature (WET sensor), and PAR in triplicate.
- Calculations: convert 27 CO2 concentration readings (ppm) over two minutes to CO2 flux (mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1); include explicit constants (molar mass of C, molar mass of CO2, gas constant); time points referenced to t0 and t120 seconds; ΔCO2 over an hour computed from replicated measurements.
- Outputs are expressed per chamber volume and area to yield flux rates (mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1).

## Greenhouse gas sampling (CH4, CO2, N2O)
- Chambers with reflective covers; 9 ml air drawn into evacuated vials at 10, 20, and 30 minutes.
- Gas concentrations measured by Gas-Chromatograph (Agilent 7890B).
- Final gas concentration values calculated using the same approach as the IRGA-based CO2 flux.

## Soil sampling and initial processing
- Six soil samples per site using a 4 cm auger; sampling depth up to 10 cm.
- Soils sieved to pass 2 mm; stored at 5°C until processing.

## Bulk density
- Two cores per site for 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths; dried at 80°C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Bulk density computed as mass/volume.

## pH and moisture
- pH: 5 g soil mixed 1:1 with Milli-Q water; measured with pH meter.
- Volumetric moisture: 5 g fresh soil dried to determine moisture content as a proportion of wet weight.

## Water extractable N and C
- 5 g soil with 25 ml Milli-Q water; shake 150 rpm for 1 hour; filter.
- DIN (NH4+, NO3-, total N) and DOC measured (autoanalyser and TOC analyser, respectively).
- Undiluted filtrate adjusted for soil moisture for DIN/DOC per kg dry soil.

## KCl extractable N and mineralisation
- 5 g soil with 25 ml 1 M KCl; shake for 1 hour; filter; dilute 2:1; analyze for DIN (NH4+, NO3-) via autoanalyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture; DIN per kg dry soil calculated.
- Incubation: 5 g soil incubated at 25°C for 14 days; extracts analyzed as above.
- Mineralisation: (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ days, expressed as g m^-2 day^-1.

## Microbial biomass (fumigation-extraction)
- 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform in a desiccator; 24 hours to lyse microbes.
- Unfumigated comparison sample.
- Nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4; analyzed by autoanalyser (DIN and dissolved P); dissolved carbon measured by TOC-L.
- Data adjusted for water content; KE (killed extraction) C and KEN quotients applied (0.35 and 0.54) to correct for extraction efficiency.
