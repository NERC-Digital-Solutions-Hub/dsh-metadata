# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Objective: Test how different plant communities affect carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health by using seed and plug-plant communities on bare chalk and comparing carbon and nutrient cycling rates across functional groups.

- Timeframe: March 2013 to September 2016.

- Primary approach: Group plant species into three functional effect trait groups (FG) expected to have distinct impacts on their surroundings; evaluate how these groups influence soil carbon, nitrogen cycling, and microbial activity.

- Plant functional groups (FG) and example species:
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species (examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata).
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited carbon/nitrogen impact (examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides).
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, abundant roots and large leaves; rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; strong microbial activity (examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.).

- Experimental design and treatments:
  - A grid-based layout creating all combinations of the three FG groups across plots.
  - Plot layout: 7 across and 6 down, with 42 plots total; each plot 8 m x 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
  - Each plot represents a specific combination of FG1/FG2/FG3; combinations replicated across the grid (six replicates overall).

- Plot details and layout specifics:
  - Plants arranged across a slope (top to bottom) with labeling indicating plot identity and FG composition (plots include single FG, FG1&2, FG1&3, FG2&3, FG1&2&3 in various positions).
  - The FG combinations are repeated across rows and columns to achieve replication and ensure coverage of all treatment permutations.

- Data collection focus:
  - Measurements of carbon storage in soil, nitrogen cycling rates, and overall ecosystem health.
  - Assessment of how different FG compositions influence soil carbon, nitrogen availability, and microbial activity.

- Timeline and drought treatment:
  - Rain shelters introduced from 2015 onward to study drought effects.
  - Shelters deployed from the beginning of June to mid-July each year, simulating an extreme drought event (once in 100 years).

- Relevance and anticipated outcomes:
  - The design tests whether FG-driven root structures and growth strategies lead to measurable differences in carbon storage and soil fertility.
  - Provides a framework to compare how plant community composition modulates carbon and nutrient dynamics under normal and drought conditions.
