# Soil sampling

- Two soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width augur, as deep as possible.
- Soil was passed through a sieve with 2 mm aperture to remove stones and roots.
- Stones retained were weighed to ascertain the proportion of gravel and chalk flints in the sample.
- Soil cores were split into 5 cm depth increments, dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- They were stored at 25 °C until ready for processing.

## Bulk density

- The soil was weighed and bulk density (BD) calculated as mass/volume.
- BD was adjusted for gravel incursions using the formula: Adjusted BD = (unadjusted BD) × (100 − % gravel) / 100.

## Carbon and nitrogen analysis

- Each depth fraction was ground using a ball mill at 25 s−1 for two minutes.
- Samples were treated with 10% HCl to dissolve carbonates from chalk via a dropwise process until effervescence ceased.
- The samples were redried and then 10 ± 0.5 mg was used for combustion analysis.
- Analyses were performed with an Elementar Vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with an acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).

## Quality control

- Standards and blanks were run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser.
- 5% analytical replicates were included.
