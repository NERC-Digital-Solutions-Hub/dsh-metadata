# Soil sampling

- Two soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width auger, with depth taken as deep as possible.
- Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots; stones retained weighed to determine gravel and chalk flint content.
- Soil cores split into 5 cm depth increments, dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving, then stored at 25 °C until processing.

## Bulk density

- Soil weighed; bulk density (BD) calculated as mass/volume.
- BD adjusted for gravel content using: Adjusted BD = Unadjusted BD × (100 − % gravel) / 100.

## Carbon and nitrogen analysis

- Each depth fraction ground in a ball mill at 25 s⁻¹ for two minutes.
- Carbonates dissolved with 10% HCl via dropwise addition until effervescence ceased; samples redried.
- 10 ± 0.5 mg used for combustion analysis.
- Analyses performed with an Elementar vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with an acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).

## Quality control

- Standards and blanks run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser; 5% analytical replicates included. 

## Data governance implications for data system (Data Leaders)

- The protocol supports reproducibility and metadata capture (depth increments, drying times, sieve size, chemical treatments).
- Quality control measures provide traceability and data validity.
- Standardized units and calculation methods (e.g., bulk density, depth segmentation) facilitate integration with broader datasets and cross-site comparison.
