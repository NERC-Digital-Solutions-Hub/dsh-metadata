# Soil sampling

## Overview
- Describes field sampling and lab analysis to quantify soil physical and chemical properties (bulk density, carbon, nitrogen) across depth increments, with quality control measures.

## Sampling procedure
- Two soil samples per site were collected with a 4 cm width auger, taking soil as deep as possible.
- Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Retained stones weighed to determine the proportion of gravel and chalk flints.
- Soil cores split into 5 cm depth increments; dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Samples stored at 25 °C until processing.

## Bulk density
- Bulk density (BD) calculated as mass/volume.
- BD adjusted for gravel using: Adjusted BD = (unadjusted BD) × (100 − % gravel) / 100.
- Gravel-adjusted BD values prepared for downstream mapping and analysis.

## Carbon and nitrogen analysis
- Each depth fraction ground in a ball mill at 25 s−1 for two minutes.
- Carbonates dissolved with 10% HCl dropwise until effervescence ceased.
- Samples redried; 10 ± 0.5 mg used for combustion analysis.
- Analysis performed with an Elementar Vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).
- Quality control via standards and blanks included in the run.

## Quality control
- Standards and blanks run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser.
- 5% analytical replicates included. 

## GIS data implications
- Depth-resolved data: BD, carbon, and nitrogen values for 5 cm increments (e.g., 0–5 cm, 5–10 cm) per site, with two samples per site.
- Suitable for map-based visualization and 3D soil property mapping when tied to site locations.
- Requires consistent units and labeling (BD in mass per volume; carbon and nitrogen as percentages) and careful depth bookkeeping.
- QA data (standards, blanks, replicates) supports reliability for spatial analyses and comparative mapping.
- Data integration considerations: align depth-specific measurements across sites, handle missing depths, and fuse with other spatial datasets for comprehensive soil GIS products.
