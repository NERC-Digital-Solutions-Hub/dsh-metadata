# Vegetation work

- The document outlines field and lab methods to monitor vegetation structure and ecosystem gas exchanges as part of environmental monitoring.
- Key monitored components include vegetation cover and diversity, aboveground biomass, and soil–atmosphere fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O, along with soil chemical and biological properties.

## Vegetation measurements

- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover for each plant species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs summed across the four quadrats.
- Biomass: biomass clipped at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 h, weighed, then summed across the site to yield g biomass per m².
- Diversity: Shannon’s diversity index calculated using Shannon and Weaver (1963).

## Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis and respiration

- Four soil collars (25 cm diameter) embedded in the soil.
- Transparent chambers (25 cm diameter, ~491 cm³) mounted on an infrared gas analyser (IRGA); CO2 influx measured over 2 minutes; a reflective cover used to obtain dark CO2 efflux.
- Environmental measurements taken in triplicate: soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).
- CO2 flux calculations convert 27 measurements of CO2 (ppm) over 2 minutes into flux (mg CO2 m⁻² h⁻¹). Example steps include pairing start time x and time intervals to derive flux.
- CO2 flux is reported as ΔCO2 over one hour and final flux is normalized by chamber volume, area, and time.

## Methane (CH4), CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O)

- Chambers with reflective covers placed in collars; gas samples (9 mL) collected at 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes, noting exact times.
- Gases analyzed with a Gas Chromatograph (GC).
- Final gas fluxes calculated using the same framework as the IRGA-based CO2 flux calculations.

## Soil sampling

- Six soil samples per site collected using a 4 cm diameter auger to 10 cm depth, sieved to 2 mm, stored at 5°C until processing.

## Bulk density

- Two cores per site (0–5 cm and 5–10 cm) dried at 80°C for 48 h after sieving; bulk density calculated as mass per volume.

## pH

- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 5 g Milli-Q water (1:1) and pH measured with a pH meter.

## Volumetric moisture content

- Fresh soil weighed (5.0 ± 0.001 g), dried at 80°C for 48 h; moisture content calculated as the proportion of wet weight.

## Water extractable N and C

- 5 g soil shaken with 25 mL Milli-Q water for 1 h; filtrate analyzed for DIN (NH4+, NO3-, total N) by autoanalyser and DOC by TOC analyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using a moisture-corrected formula to yield DIN/DOC in mg/kg.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation

- 5 g soil with 25 mL 1 M KCl, shaken 1 h; filtrate analyzed for DIN.
- Extraction adjusted for moisture; DIN reported in mg/kg.
- A second 5 g sample incubated at 25°C for 14 days; extracts analyzed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ days, in g m⁻² day⁻¹.

## Microbial biomass

- Fumigation–extraction: 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform to lyse microbes, compared with an unfumigated control.
- After 24 h, extracted with 25 mL 0.5 M K2SO4; solutions filtered and analysed by autoanalyser at appropriate dilutions for DIN, extractable PO4, and dissolved carbon (TOC).
- Values adjusted for moisture; KE (carbon) and KEN (nitrogen) quotients applied to correct extraction efficiency (0.35 for KE, 0.54 for KEN).
