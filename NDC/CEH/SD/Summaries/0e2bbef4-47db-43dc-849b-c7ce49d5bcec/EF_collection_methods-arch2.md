# Vegetation work

- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site for assessment.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species; species richness and percentage cover of grasses/forbs calculated by summing quadrats.
- Biomass: biomass clipped at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80 °C for 24 hours, weighed, and summed across the site to give g biomass per m^2.
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).

## Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis and respiration

- Four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) embedded in the soil; transparent chambers attached to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA) to measure CO2 influx over two minutes.
- After two minutes, a reflective cover placed over the chamber to measure CO2 efflux in the dark.
- Soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and PAR measured in triplicate concurrently.
- CO2 flux calculated from 27 measurements over two minutes to yield mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1.
- Formulas and predicted CO2 values described; calculations compare initial and subsequent time points to derive ΔCO2 and final flux.

## Methane (CH4), CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O)

- Chambers covered with reflective material placed in collars; 9 mL air samples collected at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes.
- Gas concentrations measured with a Gas-Chromatograph (Agilent 7890B).
- Final gas flux values calculated using methods consistent with IRGA-based CO2 measurements.

## Soil sampling

- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm diameter auger to 10 cm depth where possible.
- Soils sieved to 2 mm to remove stones and roots; stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Bulk density

- Two cores per site (0–5 cm and 5–10 cm); dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Bulk density calculated as mass per volume.

## pH

- 5 g fresh soil mixed with Milli-Q water at a 1:1 ratio; pH measured with a pH meter (LE409 probe).

## Volumetric moisture content

- Fresh soil weighed (5 ± 0.001 g), dried at 80 °C for 48 hours; moisture content calculated from dry/wet weights.

## Water extractable N and C

- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 mL Milli-Q water, shaken 150 rpm for 1 hour; filtered.
- Undiluted filtrate analyzed for DIN (NH4, NO3, total N) via autoanalyser; DOC analyzed with TOC analyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using a specified conversion equation to express DIN/DOC as mg/kg dry soil.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation

- 5 g soil with 25 mL 1 M KCl, shaken 150 rpm for 1 hour; filtered and diluted 2:1 for DIN analysis.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture; mineralisation estimated from NO3 + NH4, bulk density, and days incubated (14 days).

## Microbial biomass

- Fumigation method: 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform to lyse microbes; compared to an unfumigated sample.
- Nutrients extracted with 25 mL 0.5 M K2SO4; analyzed by autoanalyser and TOC-L at appropriate dilutions.
- Data adjusted for water content; KE (killed-extractable) factors used (0.35 for C, 0.54 for N) to correct extraction efficiency.
