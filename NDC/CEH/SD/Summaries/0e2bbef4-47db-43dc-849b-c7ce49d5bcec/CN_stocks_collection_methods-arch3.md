# Soil sampling, Bulk density, Carbon and nitrogen analysis, Quality control

- Soil sampling
  - Two soil samples per site were taken using a 4 cm width auger, as deep as possible.
  - Samples passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots; retained stones weighed to determine gravel and chalk flint content.
  - Soil cores divided into 5 cm depth increments; dried at 80°C for 48 hours after sieving.
  - Processed samples stored at 25°C until ready for processing.

- Bulk density
  - Bulk density (BD) calculated from weight and volume.
  - BD adjusted for gravel content using: Adjusted BD = (unadjusted BD / 100) × (100 − % gravel).

- Carbon and nitrogen analysis
  - Each depth fraction ground in a ball mill at 25 s⁻¹ for 2 minutes.
  - Carbonates dissolved with 10% HCl in a dropwise manner until effervescence ceased.
  - Samples redried; ~10 mg (10 ± 0.5 mg) used for combustion analysis.
  - Analyzed on an Elementar Vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).

- Quality control
  - Standards and blanks run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser.
  - 5% analytical replicates included. 

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Standardized sampling and analytical procedures enable comparability across sites and time.
  - Built-in QA/QC (standards, blanks, replicates) supports data quality and governance, aiding transparency and reliability of environmental health monitoring outputs.
