# Soil sampling

- Two soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width augur, penetrating as deep as possible.
- Samples were sieved with a 2 mm aperture to remove stones and roots; stones retained were weighed to estimate gravel content.
- Soil cores were divided into 5 cm depth increments, dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving, and stored at 25 °C until processing.

## Bulk density

- Bulk density (BD) was calculated as mass/volume.
- BD was adjusted for gravel content using: Adjusted BD = (unadjusted BD) × (100 − % gravel) / 100.

## Carbon and nitrogen analysis

- Each depth fraction was ground in a ball mill at 25 s⁻¹ for 2 minutes.
- Carbonates were dissolved with 10% HCl in a dropwise manner until effervescence ceased; samples were redried.
- 10 ± 0.5 mg of each sample was used for combustion analysis.
- Analyses were performed with an Elementar Vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated using an acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).

## Quality control

- Standard references and blanks were run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser.
- Analytical replicates accounted for at 5%. 

## Data governance and metadata considerations for Data Stewards

- Capture detailed metadata for reproducibility and discovery:
  - Site identifiers, precise coordinates, sampling date, sampler, auger dimensions (4 cm width), sieve size (2 mm), depth increments (5 cm), drying and storage temperatures.
  - Gravel content measurements and method of weighing stones.
  - BD calculation method and any adjustments for gravel.
  - Depth-specific C and N results, units, and calibration details.
  - Instruments used (Elementar Vario EL), calibration standards (acetanilide) and their known compositions.
  - Processing steps (grinding frequency/duration, acid dissolution protocol) and sample mass used for combustion.
  - QA/QC records: frequency of standards/blanks, replicate information.
- Ensure data formats are standardized, with clear units and method references, to support interoperability and reuse.
- Document data provenance, sample handling, storage conditions, and any updates or embargoes.
