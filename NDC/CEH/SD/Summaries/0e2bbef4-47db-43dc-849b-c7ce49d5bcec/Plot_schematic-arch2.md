# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Objective: Use seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk, then test carbon and nutrient cycling rates and compare these to the characteristics of the plant groups.

## Timeline and scope
- Study period: March 2013 to September 2016.
- Main outcomes: measurements of carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health across plant functional groups.

## Plant functional groups and representative species
- Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
  - Representative species: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
  - Predicted effect: substantial soil carbon storage with roots delivering carbon deeper into the soil.
- Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
  - Representative species: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - Predicted effect: limited carbon and nitrogen cycling due to small planting footprint.
- Group 3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large, fleshy leaves; long-lived.
  - Representative species: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
  - Predicted effect: rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling with high microbial activity; potential lower long-term carbon storage due to quick turnover.

## Experimental design and plot layout
- Plot grid: 7 across by 6 down, creating a factorial arrangement of plant group combinations.
- Plot size and spacing: each plot 8 m x 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
- Treatments: all combinations of the three plant groups (FG1, FG2, FG3) replicated six times across the grid.
- Layout notes: plots labeled and arranged along the slope (top to bottom), with a systematic mapping of group combinations to plots.

## Drought treatment
- From 2015 onward, rain shelters were installed to simulate drought conditions.
- Shelter period: June to mid-July, representing an extreme drought event (approximately once in 100 years).

## Data and outputs
- Data collected to assess: carbon storage in soil, carbon and nitrogen cycling rates, and overall ecosystem health.
- Comparative aim: evaluate how different functional group combinations influence environmental health indicators and nutrient dynamics.

## Data management and broader relevance for monitoring
- The document details study design, group classifications, and replication but does not specify data QA processes, storage, or portal submission.
- The standardized factorial design and temporal drought treatment provide a framework suitable for integration with other monitoring datasets and for long-term environmental health assessments.
