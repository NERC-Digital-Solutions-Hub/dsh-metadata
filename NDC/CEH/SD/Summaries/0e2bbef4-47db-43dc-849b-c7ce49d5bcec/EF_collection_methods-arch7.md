# Vegetation work

- Field design and scope
  - Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats per site, placed randomly
  - Measurements span vegetation structure, soil properties, and greenhouse gas fluxes
- Vegetation measurements
  - Visual estimation of percent cover for each species
  - Species richness and percent cover of grasses and forbs aggregated from the four quadrats
  - Biomass: biomass clipped at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, weighed; site biomass calculated by summing quadrats (g biomass m^-2)
  - Diversity: Shannon’s index (Shannon & Weaver, 1963)
- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis and respiration
  - Four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) embedded in soil with infrared gas analyser (EGM-4 IRGA)
  - CO2 flux measured over two minutes; dark flux obtained with reflective cover
  - Simultaneous measurements of soil moisture, temperature (WET sensor), and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) in triplicate
  - CO2 flux converted from chamber measurements to mg m^-2 h^-1 using chamber volume, area, and temperature/pressure terms
- Greenhouse gases (CH4, CO2, N2O)
  - Reflective-covered chambers in collars; air samples collected at 0, 10, 20, 30 minutes
  - Gas concentrations measured by Gas Chromatograph (GC)
  - Final gas fluxes calculated using the same framework as IRGA-derived CO2
- Soil sampling and processing
  - Six soil samples per site, collected with a 4 cm auger to ~10 cm depth
  - Samples sieved to 2 mm; stored at 5°C until processing
- Bulk density
  - Two cores per site (0–5 cm and 5–10 cm), dried at 80°C for 48 hours
  - Bulk density calculated as mass/volume
- pH and moisture
  - pH: 5 g soil + 5 ml water (1:1) measured with pH meter
  - Volumetric moisture content: fresh soil weighed, dried at 80°C for 48 hours; moisture calculated as proportion of wet weight
- Water extractable nitrogen (N) and carbon (C)
  - 5 g soil with 25 ml Milli-Q water, shaken 1 hour; filtrate analyzed for DIN (NH4, NO3, total N) and DOC
  - Adjustments for soil moisture to express DIN/DOC as mg/kg
- KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
  - 5 g soil with 25 ml 1 M KCl, shaken 1 hour; filtrate analyzed for DIN
  - Extracts adjusted for moisture; additional 5 g soil incubated 14 days at 25°C for mineralisation (NO3 + NH4) calculation
- Microbial biomass
  - Fumigation (chloroform) method to lyse cells; unfumigated comparison
  - Extraction with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4; DIN, PO4, and dissolved carbon measured
  - Data corrected for water content and extraction efficiency using KE C and KEN factors (0.35 and 0.54)
- Calculations and units
  - Biomass expressed as g m^-2; CO2 and other gas fluxes expressed as mg m^-2 h^-1
  - Nutrient concentrations standardized to dry soil weight (mg/kg)
  - Mineralisation expressed as g m^-2 day^-1
- Data quality and standardization considerations for GIS
  - Multi-scale measurements (quadrats, collars, cores) suitable for layered GIS datasets
  - Explicit units and aggregation steps enable consistent merging with other spatial datasets
  - Need for consistent sampling dates, coordinates, and metadata to support map-based analyses
