# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Aim and scope
  - Long-term field study (March 2013 to September 2016) using seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk.
  - Test how plant functional groups (FGs) influence carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health by comparing outcomes across FG group characteristics.

- Plant functional groups (FGs) and predictions
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; leaves are thin and large. Includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
    - Predictions: substantial soil carbon storage; roots transport carbon deeper into soil, less accessible to microbes.
    - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
    - Predictions: limited carbon and nitrogen cycling; smaller physical presence.
    - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; fast turnover.
    - Predictions: rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potentially less carbon storage due to quick turnover.
    - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

- Experimental design and layout
  - A grid of plots laid out in the field: 7 across by 6 down, each plot 8 m x 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
  - All possible combinations of the three FG groups included within each row, replicated across six cores (six replicates per treatment).
  - Plot labeling reflects FG combinations; a systematic arrangement ensures replication of each FG combination.

- Data collection and measurements
  - Groundwork to measure: carbon storage, soil nitrogen and carbon cycling rates, soil fertility, and overall ecosystem health.
  - Comparisons designed to assess how different FG combinations influence these ecosystem properties.

- Drought treatment (rain shelters)
  - From 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to plots to simulate drought conditions.
  - Shelters operated from the beginning of June to mid-July, mimicking an extreme (once in 100 years) drought event.

- Timeline and significance
  - Data collection occurred across the 2013–2016 study period.
  - Introduction of drought treatment in 2015 provides a paired assessment of FG-driven effects under moisture stress.

- Data opportunities and potential outputs for end users
  - Data products: a plot-level dataset linking FG combinations, replication, year, drought status, and measured carbon/nitrogen metrics; species composition per plot; environmental covariates (e.g., moisture).
  - Analyses and visualizations: comparisons of carbon storage and nutrient cycling across FG groups, drought vs. non-drought periods, and interactions between FG composition and moisture stress.
  - Dashboards or pivot-style reports to explore how FG traits relate to ecosystem outcomes, enabling researchers to self-serve insights on functional effects and drought resilience.
