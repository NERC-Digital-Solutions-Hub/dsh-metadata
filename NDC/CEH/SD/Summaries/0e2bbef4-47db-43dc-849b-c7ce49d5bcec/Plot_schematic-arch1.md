# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Aim
- Use seeds and plug plants to establish different plant communities on bare chalk at Winklebury Hill.
- Test carbon and nutrient (nitrogen) cycling rates and compare them to the characteristics of the plant groups (functional effects traits).
- Study conducted from March 2013 to September 2016.

## Experimental design and plant groups
- Plants were categorized into three functional groups (FG) based on traits likely to influence ecosystem processes:
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
    - Predictions: high soil carbon storage due to deep rooting.
    - Example species: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited above- and below-ground biomass.
    - Predictions: minimal impact on carbon and nitrogen cycling.
    - Example species: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, numerous roots and large leaves; long-lived.
    - Predictions: rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling with strong microbial activity; potential lower long-term carbon storage.
    - Example species: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
- A large species list was allocated to FG1, FG2, or FG3, forming a grid-based treatment matrix.

## Plot layout and replication
- Plots arranged as a grid of 7 across by 6 down (42 plots total).
- Each plot measures 8 m x 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
- All possible combinations of the three functional groups were included within the grid, replicated six times.
- Plot labeling followed a top-to-bottom, slope-oriented scheme to track position.

## Data collection focus
- Aimed to quantify differences in:
  - Carbon storage in soil and plant tissues.
  - Nitrogen cycling and soil fertility changes.
  - Overall ecosystem health indicators associated with plant functional group composition.

## Rain-drought treatment (2015 onward)
- From 2015, rain shelters were installed to simulate drought conditions.
- Shelters remained from early June to mid-July to mimic an extreme drought event (once in 100 years).
- The drought treatment was applied across plots to assess interaction effects between plant functional groups and water availability.

## Summary of key design features
- Longitudinal field experiment on chalk grassland (Winklebury Hill) spanning 2013–2016.
- Three clearly defined plant functional groups with representative species.
- Comprehensive 7x6 plot grid enabling all FG combinations with six replicates.
- Precise plot scale (8 m x 8 m) and spacing (2 m gaps) to manage interactions and measurement feasibility.
- Introduction of a drought manipulation (rain shelters) starting in 2015 to test resilience and functional-group effects under water stress.
