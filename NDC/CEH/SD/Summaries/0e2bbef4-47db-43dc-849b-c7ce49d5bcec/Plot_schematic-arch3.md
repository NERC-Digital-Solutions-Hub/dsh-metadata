# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Aim
  - Use seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk and test resulting carbon and nutrient cycling rates, comparing these to the characteristics of the plant groups.

- Timeline
  - March 2013 – September 2016.

- Plant functional groups (FG) and representative species
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; large leaves (long-lived, including some annuals/biennials). Example species include Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata, among many others listed in the study.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots (less above-ground impact on carbon/nitrogen cycling). Example species include Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, extensive roots and fast cycling; high microbial activity in soil, leaves, and roots. Example species include Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

- Experimental design and plot layout
  - A grid of plots laid out in 7 across by 6 down, with each plot 8m x 8m and 2m gaps between plots.
  - Every across position represented a full combination of the three plant groups, replicated across the grid six times.
  - Included single FG plots and mixtures (e.g., FG1, FG2, FG3, FG1&2, FG1&3, FG2&3, FG1&2&3), arranged to test how different functional-group compositions influence outcomes.

- Measurements and goals
  - Target outcomes: carbon storage in soil, rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling, and overall ecosystem health as influenced by the plant group compositions.
  - Data were collected through the established plot design to compare community types and their effects on soil and ecosystem processes.

- Drought treatment
  - From 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to plots to simulate drought conditions.
  - Shelters operated from early June to mid-July, mimicking an extreme drought (approximately once in 100 years).

- Additional notes
  - A comprehensive list of species per functional group was used to populate plots, enabling detailed analysis of trait-driven effects on soil carbon/nutrient dynamics.
