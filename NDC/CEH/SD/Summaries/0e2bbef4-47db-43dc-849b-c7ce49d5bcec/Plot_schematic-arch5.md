# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Aim
- Investigate how different plant communities, created from seeds and plug plants on bare chalk, influence carbon and nutrient cycling.
- Compare observed ecosystem processes to the characteristics of three plant groups defined by functional effects traits.
- Run period: March 2013 to September 2016.

## Experimental design and plant groups
- Plants grouped into three functional effect trait groups (FG) intended to have distinct impacts on carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health.
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited carbon/nitrogen impact.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential for less long-term carbon storage.
- Example species per group (selected among many listed) are provided to illustrate group characteristics.
- Treatment structure: a grid of plots combining the three groups to examine interactions and effects on ecosystem processes.

## Plot layout and replication
- 42 plots arranged in an 8 m × 8 m grid with 2 m gaps between plots.
- Across the grid, every combination of the three plant groups is represented; the grid is replicated six times.
- Top-to-bottom slope orientation included; plot labeling indicates FG combinations and positions (e.g., across rows and down columns).
- Layout details indicate a systematic, replicated design to enable comparison of community types.

## Data collection and treatments
- Primary outcomes: measurements of carbon storage and nitrogen cycling, along with broader ecosystem health indicators.
- Rain shelters added from 2015 onward to simulate drought conditions:
  - Shelters operated from early June to mid-July each year to mimic extreme drought (approximately once in 100 years).
- The drought treatment allows assessment of resilience and changes in carbon and nutrient dynamics under water stress.

## Timeline and progression
- Initial establishment and data collection from 2013 to 2016.
- Rain shelter drought treatment implemented starting in 2015, continuing in subsequent years.

## Data stewardship considerations (archetype perspective)
- Data structure and metadata
  - Plot-level data with clear identifiers for each plot, FG combination, slope position, replication, and treatment (drought vs. control).
  - Detailed species lists and their FG assignments, plus documentation of which species belong to each FG.
  - Temporal data for measurements of carbon and nitrogen cycling, along with measurement dates.
  - Drought treatment status and shelter timing; environmental covariates (e.g., soil conditions, microclimate) if collected.
- Standards and interoperability
  - Use consistent plot IDs, FG coding, and species nomenclature.
  - Standard units and measurement protocols for carbon and nitrogen metrics.
  - Comprehensive data dictionary and method descriptions to enable reuse and replication.
- Data quality and provenance
  - Quality assurance/quality control steps to verify plot treatments, FG assignments, and measurement records.
  - Versioning and change logs for dataset updates; documentation of any data repairs or reclassifications.
- Data sharing and governance
  - Clear documentation for data users, including study aims, design, treatments, and limitations.
  - Considerations for data access, licensing, and any embargoes; guidance for researchers reusing long-term, complex field data.
- Anticipated challenges
  - Complex, multifactor design requiring careful metadata to avoid misinterpretation.
  - Ensuring timely data capture and consistent metadata across years and treatment conditions.
  - Managing potential data gaps or inconsistencies arising from field conditions and treatment applications.
