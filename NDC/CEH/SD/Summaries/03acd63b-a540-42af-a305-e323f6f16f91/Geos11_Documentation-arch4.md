# Overview of data

- A field data compilation from the NERC Macronutrients consortium, focusing on stream metabolism and lateral exchange in C, N, and P flux. The dataset supports understanding atmospheric inputs in riverine catchments.
- Contains results from four field campaigns measuring in situ atmospheric data in rivers within the Hampshire Avon catchment, collected with a SKYWATCH GEOS 11 high-precision weather station.
- Includes 23 accompanying CSV data files named Geos11_<SiteCode>_<Season>.CSV, covering multiple sites and seasons.

- Field campaigns and sites
  - Four campaigns: spring 2013, summer 2013, autumn 2013, winter 2014 (note: data not collected at site CE1 in winter due to flooding).
  - Sites (with codes and approximate coordinates):
    - CE1: River Ebble
    - GA2: River Avon
    - GN1: River Nadder
    - CW2: River Wylye
    - AS1 (AP): tributary of the River Sem
    - AS2 (AS): River Sem
- Data collection details
  - Instrument: GEOS 11 weather station by JDC Electronic SA; factory-calibrated prior to field campaigns (March 2013).
  - Position: 1–4 m above the stream surface, depending on morphology and access.
  - Sampling frequency: 15–30 seconds (limited by battery life).
  - Calibration and drift: internal compass for wind direction with field calibration, recalibrated after battery changes.
- File naming and structure
  - Files labeled Geos11_<SiteCode>_<Season>.CSV, where SiteCode identifies the river site and Season identifies the field campaign period.
  - Seasons covered: spring, summer, autumn 2013; winter 2014.
- Data columns and metadata
  - Core columns: DateTime, Date, Time, Wind (m/s), Temperature (°C), Humidity (%rH), Pressure (hPa), Direction (wind direction, degrees North).
  - Data quality notes: NaN values indicate missing data (due to battery changes, data download issues, or contamination from insufficient wind for stable wind direction data).
  - Units, resolutions, and accuracies provided:
    - Wind: resolution 0.1 m/s; accuracy ±2% or measured value.
    - Temperature: resolution 0.1 °C; accuracy ±2% (or 0.5 °C at 25 °C).
    - Humidity: resolution 0.1 %rH; accuracy ±2% at 50 %rH.
    - Pressure: resolution 0.1 hPa; accuracy ±0.5% (or 1.5 hPa) at 25 °C.
    - Direction: resolution 1°; accuracy ±3%; compass calibrated in the field.
- Data provenance and usability
  - Data collected under the leadership of Prof. R.N. Glud; contributors include L. Rovelli, K. Attard, and Assoc. Prof. H. Stahl.
  - The dataset is suitable for cross-site and temporally-variant analyses of atmospheric inputs to stream metabolism and related processes.
  - Spatial and temporal context (site coordinates, campaign periods) enhances discoverability and integration with broader data networks.
- Practical considerations for data leaders
  - Data gaps and site-specific limitations (e.g., no winter data at CE1) require careful handling in analyses.
  - The presence of NaN values and potential wind direction drift necessitates robust data cleaning and metadata consideration.
  - Clear naming conventions, site codes, and provenance support effective data governance, reproducibility, and collaboration across data communities.
