# Soil dates using 210Pb in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- A study detailing 210Pb dating of the upper soil profile in subarctic Canada, using multiple sites sampled in 2013 and 2014 to establish age-depth information for peatland and forest soils.

## Sites and sampling
- Sites and codes: FFU (FireFox Unburnt), FFB (FireFox Burnt), TPP (Teslin Peatland Plateau), TW (Teslin Wetland Mid), TWM (Teslin Wetland Margin), MCU (Mosquito Creek Unburnt), MCB (Mosquito Creek Burnt), WTP (White Truck Plateau), WTM (White Truck Moss), WTS (White Truck Sedge), WTW (White Truck Wetland).
- Sampling depth: upper soil profiles cut at 1 cm intervals.
- Timing: cores collected in early summer 2013 and 2014.
- Sample preparation: cores freeze-dried and ground prior to analysis.

## Laboratory methods
- Planchet preparation: silver planchets washed in acetone, spray-painted on one side.
- Digestion: peat powder (0.5 g dry weight), 1 mL 209Po spike, 10 mL HNO3, heated to dryness; repeated oxidation with 10 mL 30% H2O2 and drying; additional 5 mL 6M HCl and drying; final addition of 5 mL more HCl.
- Analyte processing: solution transferred to acid-washed tubes with 0.5M HCl, centrifuged (10 min at 2500 rpm); supernatant discarded.
- Planchet loading: ~0.2 g ascorbic acid added, planchets suspended in solution for at least 24 hours; rinsed and dried.
- Measurement: alpha-spectrometry using Ortec Octête Plus and Maestro-32; minimum 24-hour counting with a target of at least 400 counts.

## Dating technique
- Age assignment: Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) models applied to 210Pb data to determine ages.
- Reference method: CRS approach following Appleby (2001) for chronostratigraphic techniques.

## Data quality and reporting
- Emphasis on standardized laboratory procedures, detailed stepwise digestion and measurement protocol to ensure reproducibility.
- Use of a recognized dating framework (CRS) to derive ages, enabling consistent interpretation across sites.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates rigorous data provenance, traceability, and methodological transparency essential for environmental monitoring.
- Provides age-dated sediment records useful for understanding recent environmental change in subarctic peatlands and forests.
- Highlights the importance of standardized protocols and reference methodologies for comparability and quality assurance in environmental health monitoring.
