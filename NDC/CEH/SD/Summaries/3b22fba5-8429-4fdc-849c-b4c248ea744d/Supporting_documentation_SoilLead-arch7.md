# Soil dates using 210Pb in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Presents 210Pb dating of the upper part of soil profiles from permafrost regions in subarctic Canada.
- Profiles cut at 1 cm intervals to generate depth-resolved age information using the CRS model.

## Study sites and sampling
- Soil cores collected during early summer in 2013 and 2014.
- Site codes and descriptions:
  - FFU - FireFox Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
  - FFB - FireFox Burnt: black spruce forest burnt in 1998
  - TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin
  - TW - Teslin Wetland Mid: thawed peatland plateau
  - TWM - Teslin Wetland Margin: margin of thawed peatland plateau
  - MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
  - MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: burnt black spruce forest
  - WTP - White Truck Plateau: peatland plateau near Yellowknife
  - WTM - White Truck Moss: recently thawed peatland plateau with moss
  - WTS - White Truck Sedge: recently thawed peatland plateau with sedge/moss
  - WTW - White Truck Wetland: older thaw feature (thawed peatland plateau)
  
## Sample processing and measurement
- Upper soil sections (0–) measured at 1 cm increments; samples freeze-dried and ground.
- 210Pb activity determined via alpha spectrometry with the following protocol:
  - Prepare silver planchets: wash in acetone and spray paint one side.
  - Digest samples: 0.5 g dry weight peat powder, 1 mL 209Po spike, 10 mL HNO3; heat to dry; add 10 mL 30% H2O2 and heat to dry; repeat with 5 mL 6M HCl (two rounds total).
  - Final digestion: add 5 mL more HCl; transfer to tubes with additional 0.5M HCl; centrifuge.
  - Separate and prepare final solution with ~0.2 g ascorbic acid; suspend silver planchets in solution for at least 24 hours.
  - Rinse planchets, dry, and measure using Ortec Octête Plus Integrated Alpha-Spectroscopy System with Maestro-32 software.
  - Measurement duration: minimum 24 hours, targeting a minimum count of 400 when possible.
  
## Age dating and data modeling
- Ages assigned to 210Pb data using Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) models (Appleby, 2001).
- Outputs provide ages in years corresponding to the measured depth intervals, enabling construction of age-depth profiles for each site.

## GIS and data products relevance
- Generates high-resolution (1 cm) age-depth data suitable for spatial integration and mapping of soil ages in permafrost regions.
- Can be combined with site locations and environmental layers to produce map-based visualisations of soil formation/turnover histories.
- Supports creation of regional permafrost thaw and carbon dating maps by linking depth-age data to geographic coordinates and site metadata.
