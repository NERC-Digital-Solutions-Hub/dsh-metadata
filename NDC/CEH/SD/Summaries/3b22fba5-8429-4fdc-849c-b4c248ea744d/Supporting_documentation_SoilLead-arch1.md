# Soil dates using 210Pb in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Dates upper soil profiles using 210Pb to establish chronologies in permafrost environments across subarctic Canada.
- Profiles sampled in 2013–2014 with 1 cm resolution; ages assigned using constant rate of supply (CRS) models per Appleby (2001).

## Sites and samples
- FireFox Unburnt (FFU): unburnt black spruce forest
- FireFox Burnt (FFB): burnt black spruce forest (burnt in 1998)
- Teslin Peatland Plateau (TPP)
- Teslin Wetland Mid (TW)
- Teslin Wetland Margin (TWM)
- Mosquito Creek Unburnt (MCU): unburnt black spruce forest
- Mosquito Creek Burnt (MCB): burnt black spruce forest
- White Truck Plateau (WTP): peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- White Truck Moss (WTM): recently thawed peatland plateau, moss-dominated
- White Truck Sedge (WTS): recently thawed peatland plateau, sedge/moss
- White Truck Wetland (WTW): older thaw feature (thawed peatland plateau)

## Laboratory procedures (sample preparation and measurement)
- Cores cut at 1 cm intervals; samples freeze-dried and ground.
- 210Pb dating via alpha spectrometry:
  - 0.5 g (dry weight) peat powder per sample.
  - Add 1 mL 209Po spike of known activity.
  - Digest with 10 mL HNO3, heated to dryness; repeat oxidation with 10 mL 30% H2O2; repeat with 5 mL 6M HCl (and again).
  - After digestion, combine in tubes with 0.5 M HCl; centrifuge (10 min at 2500 rpm).
  - Remove supernatant; add ~0.2 g ascorbic acid; suspend silver planchets in the sample solution for at least 24 h.
  - Rinse planchets, air-dry, measure with Ortec Octête Plus Integrated Alpha-Spectroscopy System using Maestro-32 software.
  - Measurement duration: minimum 24 h or until a minimum count of ~400 is achieved.

## 210Pb dating and age modeling
- Ages assigned to 210Pb data using Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) models.
- Approach follows Appleby (2001) for chronostratigraphic dating in recent sediments.

## Data handling and reporting
- Documented site codes and sample processing steps support reproducibility.
- Ages reported in years; upper-profile dating provides sedimentation and environmental-change context.
