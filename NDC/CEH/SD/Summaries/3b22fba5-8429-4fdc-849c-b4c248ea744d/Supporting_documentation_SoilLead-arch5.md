# Soil dates using 210Pb in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Purpose: Document 210Pb-dated upper soil profiles from subarctic Canada permafrost to establish ages for recent soil layers using constant rate of supply (CRS) models per Appleby (2001).

## Sites and codes

- FFU - FireFox Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
- FFB - FireFox Burnt: burnt black spruce forest (1998)
- TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin
- TW - Teslin Wetland Mid: thawed peatland plateau
- TWM - Teslin Wetland Margin: margin of thawed peatland plateau
- MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
- MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: burnt black spruce forest
- WTP - White Truck Plateau: peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- WTM - White Truck Moss: recently thawed peatland plateau with moss
- WTS - White Truck Sedge: recently thawed peatland plateau with sedge and moss
- WTW - White Truck Wetland: potentially older thawed peatland feature

## Sampling and data scope

- Soil cores sampled in early summer 2013 and 2014
- Upper profile dated with 210Pb at 1 cm resolution
- Samples freeze-dried and ground prior to analysis

## Laboratory preparation and dating protocol

- Planchets: silver planchets washed in acetone and spray-painted on one side
- Digestion and chemical processing:
  - 0.5 g dry peat powder
  - 1 mL 209Po spike (known activity)
  - 10 mL HNO3; heated to dry
  - 10 mL 30% H2O2; heated to dry
  - 5 mL 6M HCl; heated to dry (repeated steps with 5 mL)
  - Transfer to tubes with additional 0.5M HCl; centrifuged (10 min at 2500 rpm)
  - Supernatant decanted; jars on magnetic stirrers
  - ~0.2 g ascorbic acid added; planchets suspended in solution for at least 24 h
- Measurement: planchets rinsed, dried, measured in radiometry lab using Ortec Octête Plus Integrated Alpha-Spectroscopy System with Maestro-32 software
  - Minimum measurement: 24 hours or until at least 400 counts achieved, when possible

## Data processing and dating

- Ages assigned to 210Pb data using Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) models following Appleby (2001)

## Data governance and metadata considerations (for Data Stewards)

- Ensure detailed metadata accompany datasets (sites, codes, sampling dates, depth intervals, 210Pb activities, decay corrections, and CRS model parameters)
- Document laboratory protocol steps, reagents, spike usage, and instrumentation to support reproducibility
- Capture measurement durations, counting statistics, and minimum counts to support uncertainty assessment
- Include data lineage: sample preparation, processing timeline, and any data transformations
- Note any uncertainties, assumptions, and potential limitations (e.g., CRS model assumptions, depth resolution, sample integrity)
- Ensure clear data sharing conditions and versioning, with updates or corrections tracked
