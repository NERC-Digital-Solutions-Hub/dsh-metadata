# Soil dates using 210Pb in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Objective
- Date the upper portions of soil profiles using 210Pb dating to establish age-depth information for permafrost-related landscapes in subarctic Canada.
- Produce chronologies that support environmental change assessments and policy-relevant interpretations over time.

## Sites and sample descriptions
- Sampling period: early summer 2013 and 2014.
- Sites (codes and brief descriptions):
  - FFU: FireFox Unburnt — unburnt black spruce forest
  - FFB: FireFox Burnt — black spruce forest burnt in 1998
  - TPP: Teslin Peatland Plateau — peatland plateau near Teslin
  - TW: Teslin Wetland Mid — thawed peatland plateau
  - TWM: Teslin Wetland Margin — margin of the thawed peatland plateau
  - MCU: Mosquito Creek Unburnt — unburnt black spruce forest
  - MCB: Mosquito Creek Burnt — burnt black spruce forest
  - WTP: White Truck Plateau — peatland plateau near Yellowknife
  - WTM: White Truck Moss — recently thawed peatland plateau with moss
  - WTS: White Truck Sedge — recently thawed peatland plateau with sedge and moss
  - WTW: White Truck Wetland — potentially older collapse feature (thawed peatland plateau)

## Methods

### Sample processing and 210Pb measurement
- Core sectioning: upper soil profile cut at 1 cm intervals; cores freeze-dried and ground.
- 210Pb activity determination by alpha spectrometry with the following chemical workflow:
  - Silver planchets washed in acetone and spray-painted on one side.
  - Digestive steps in acid media: 0.5 g dry peat powder, 1 mL 209Po spike, 10 mL HNO3; heated to dryness; repeat with 10 mL 30% H2O2, then 5 mL 6M HCl (and repeat as described) to dryness.
  - Transfer to tubes with additional 0.5M HCl; centrifuge (10 min at 2500 rpm).
  - Supernatant collected; add ~0.2 g ascorbic acid; planchets suspended in solution for at least 24 h.
  - Planchets rinsed, dried, and measured in the radiometry lab using an Ortec Octête Plus Integrated Alpha-Spectroscopy System with Maestro-32 software.
  - Counting: minimum 24 h, aiming for a minimum total count of 400 if possible.
- Data quality and consistency: follow standardized chemical and measurement protocols to ensure comparability across sites.

### Age modeling
- Ages assigned to 210Pb data using Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) models (Appleby 2001) to produce age estimates for each 1 cm interval in the upper profile.

## Outputs and data interpretation
- Produces age-depth information for each site’s upper soil profile, enabling reconstruction of recent environmental change in subarctic permafrost contexts.
- Outputs suitable for integration into environmental monitoring products such as time-sliced chronologies, visualization plots, and maps of age horizons.

## Data handling and accessibility
- Data are generated with standardized methods suitable for incorporation into monitoring datasets.
- Datasets should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals to facilitate access by other researchers and decision-makers.
- Considerations for increasing data value include combining these 210Pb-derived chronologies with other environmental datasets (e.g., climate records, permafrost thaw indicators) and ensuring underlying data are openly accessible to support broader analysis.
