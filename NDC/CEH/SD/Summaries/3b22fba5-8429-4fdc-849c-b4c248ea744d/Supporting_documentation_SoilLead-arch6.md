# Soil dates using 210Pb in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Study objective: Date upper soil profiles in permafrost regions of subarctic Canada using 210Pb dating to establish age-depth information and chronologies for sampled sites.

## Data collected

- Sampling period: Early summer 2013 and 2014.
- Sites (codes and types): 
  - FFU – FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
  - FFB – FireFox Burnt (burnt black spruce forest, burnt in 1998)
  - TPP – Teslin Peatland Plateau
  - TW – Teslin Wetland Mid (thawed peatland plateau)
  - TWM – Teslin Wetland Margin (margin of thawed peatland plateau)
  - MCU – Mosquito Creek Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
  - MCB – Mosquito Creek Burnt (burnt black spruce forest)
  - WTP – White Truck Plateau (peatland plateau near Yellowknife)
  - WTM – White Truck Moss (recently thawed peatland plateau with moss)
  - WTS – White Truck Sedge (recently thawed peatland plateau with sedge/moss)
  - WTW – White Truck Wetland (potentially older thaw feature)
- Depth resolution: Upper soil profiles dated at 1 cm intervals.
- Sample preparation: 
  - Cores freeze-dried and ground.
  - Powdered peat samples processed with a 209Po tracer spike and acid digestion (HNO3, H2O2, HCl) following a multi-step digestion protocol.
  - Final preparation included transferring to planchets for alpha-spectrometry.

## Methods and data processing

- 210Pb dating approach: Determine 210Pb activity in the upper soil interval using alpha spectrometry (Ortec Octète Plus Integrated Alpha-Spectroscopy System; Maestro-32 software).
- Measurement protocol: 
  - Prepare samples with silver planchets and 209Po spike.
  - Digestion and chemical processing performed with successive acid leaching and oxidation steps.
  - Planchets measured for a minimum of 24 hours, aiming for at least 400 counts when possible.
- Age modeling: Ages assigned using the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) model for 210Pb dating, following Appleby (2001).

## Data products and outputs

- Primary data outputs:
  - 210Pb activity profiles vs. depth (1 cm increments) for each site.
  - CRS-derived ages (in years) corresponding to depth intervals.
- Potential data products for end-users:
  - Age-depth models per site (plots and tables).
  - Summaries of 210Pb activity, along with uncertainties from CRS modeling.
  - Documentation linking site codes to geographic/ecological context and sampling years.

## Data quality and considerations

- Depth resolution provides detailed upper-profile chronologies but relies on consistent sampling and digestion efficacy across sites.
- Minimum counts guidance (≥400) ensures more reliable activity measurements, though practical counts may vary.
- CRS modeling requires accurate assumptions about lead supply and consistent dating across layers.
