# Soil dates using 210Pb in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Objective: Date the upper part of soil profiles using 210Pb in multiple subarctic Canadian sites.
- Sampling: Cores collected in early summer 2013 and 2014 across several sites (FFU, FFB, TPP, TW, TWM, MCU, MCB, WTP, WTM, WTS, WTW).
- Depth resolution: 1 cm increments for dating and analysis.
- Laboratory approach: 210Pb activity determined by alpha spectrometry after a detailed chemical protocol, including Po spike addition and multiple acid digestions.
- Chronology: Ages assigned using the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) model (Appleby, 2001).

## Data lifecycle and workflow
- Sample processing: Cores are freeze-dried, ground, and cut into 1 cm sections for dating.
- Chemical preparation: 
  - Add 0.5 g dry peat powder, 1 mL 209Po spike, and 10 mL HNO3; heat to dryness.
  - Add 10 mL 30% H2O2; heat to dryness.
  - Add 5 mL 6M HCl; heat to dryness (repeat once more with 5 mL).
  - Transfer to tubes with 0.5M HCl; centrifuge.
  - Remove supernatant; add ~0.2 g ascorbic acid.
  - Suspendsilver planchets in the solution for at least 24 hours.
- Measurement: Rinse planchets, dry, and measure alpha activity with Ortec Octête Plus Integrated Alpha-Spectroscopy System using Maestro-32 software; aim for at least 400 counts and a minimum 24-hour measurement when possible.
- Data products: 210Pb activity data and CRS-derived ages for dated soil intervals.
- Reference framework: Chronostratigraphic techniques per Appleby (2001).

## Data quality, metadata, and reproducibility
- Detailed protocol: Full step-by-step methodology enables replication and auditability.
- Instrumentation and software: Alpha spectrometry with Ortec equipment; data processed with Maestro-32.
- Documentation of samples: Depth (cm), site code, sample weight (0.5 g dry weight), spike details, digestion steps, and measurement conditions documented.
- Provenance and standards: Use of established dating framework (CRS model) tied to a cited standard (Appleby, 2001).

## Data management and sharing implications for Data Leaders
- Metadata needs for discoverability: site code, depth (cm), 210Pb activity, measurement time, counts achieved, sample preparation details.
- Data standardization: Consistent units, depth-casing, and reporting of uncertainties to enable cross-site comparisons.
- Reproducibility and reuse: Comprehensive procedural documentation supports independent replication and meta-analyses across networks.
- Governance and future updates: Maintain versioned protocols, store raw radiometric data alongside processed ages, and ensure accessibility for collaborative research.

## Challenges and considerations
- Complexity and duration of the chemical separation and radiometric measurement process.
- Ensuring uniformity across multiple sites with potential sample quality variability.
- Necessity of thorough metadata to enable integration with other permafrost and sediment dating datasets.

## Key takeaways for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates end-to-end data stewardship from field sampling to chronostratigraphic dating, underpinned by rigorous, repeatable protocols.
- Highlights the critical role of detailed metadata, standardized methodologies, and alignment with established references to enable data discovery, interoperability, and collaboration across research networks.
