# Survey of British Calcareous Grasslands, 1990 & 2007

## Overview
- National survey of calcareous grasslands in Great Britain conducted 1990–1993 with a repeat survey in 2007; designed for repeatability and to minimize observer bias.
- Sites: 56 nature reserves with active management; plots: originally 128 across sites (1–6 per site), data availability reduced due to missing original reports (1990 data for 7 plots across 4 sites missing), resulting in 121 plots from 1990 and 48 plots in 2007.
- Aims to characterize vegetation and soils across a climate and pollution deposition gradient, using standardized methods to support comparisons over time.

## Data and scope
- Geographic coverage: Britain (calcareous grasslands).
- Time period: 1990 (1990–1993) and 2007 (2006–2009).
- Data categories:
  - Vegetation data: vascular plants, bryophytes, macrolichens.
  - Soil data: soil pH, organic matter content, plant-available phosphorus, nitrate, ammonium, base cations (Ca, Na, Mg, K), aluminum, and other soil chemistry metrics; organic matter by loss on ignition.
- Data handling and analysis: originally processed with VESPAN II; frequency-based vegetation data used to derive constancy and relate to British National Vegetation Classification (NVC) profiles; method emphasizes repeatability and rapid relocation of plots.

## Survey design and site selection
- Plot design: 12 x 12 m standard plots (rarely 6 x 24 m), subdivided into four 6 x 6 m blocks, then into nine 2 x 2 m units; each unit sampled by a 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrat.
- Relocation markers: permanent copper marker loops (seven loops buried 5–15 cm) to ensure accurate relocation; grids oriented consistently (up-down slopes or north-south on flat terrain).
- Site selection: areas representative of calcicolous grasslands (as described in British Plant Communities), with stable ownership and management, and ease of relocation; capture a range of aspects, altitudes, and local management (grazing).

## Vegetation and soil data collection details
- Quadrats: 36 quadrats per plot (0.5 x 0.5 m each) arranged in a stratified systematic unaligned pattern; relocation accuracy about 5 cm.
- Vegetation recording: presence/absence of all vascular plants, bryophytes, and macro lichens; species grouped into grasses, other herbs, and lower plants; rare taxa may be lumped; some vouchers collected; cover estimated for dominants only; time per plot typically 3–12 hours; grid setup about 45 minutes.
- Data capture: frequency data used to compute constancy and compare with NVC profiles (MATCH/VESPAN II references).
- Soil data collection: soil pH measured in field for 1990; in 2007, soils were sampled and analyzed in the lab; samples stored at 4°C; analyses included pH, plant-available phosphorus (Olsen-P), NO3– and NH4+ (from extracts), base cations (Ca, Na, Mg, K), Al, organic matter (LOI).

## Data quality, limitations, and interoperability
- Strengths: standardized, repeatable method designed to minimize observer bias; grid-based sampling enables robust statistical analysis; frequency data reduces sensitivity to short-term weather fluctuations.
- Limitations and challenges:
  - Unique sampling technique not directly interoperable with other datasets using different vegetation survey methods.
  - Potential biases in recording constancy for rare species; some data losses (1990 plots missing data for seven plots across four sites).
  - 1990 data: 121 plots available; 2007: 48 plots across 56 sites.
  - Relocation and marker loss risk due to metal detectors or environmental factors; limited cover estimates.
- Documentation and provenance: detailed methodological notes, site status, management, and environmental context (site altitude, aspect, slope, soil type) are recorded; datasets designed to be compatible with NVC and plant-guest matched classifications.

## Access, provenance, and documentation
- Originators and funding: 1990 DoE contract (T.C.G. Rich, E.A. Cooper, J.S. Rodwell, A.J.C. Malloch); 2007 NERC grant (L.J.L. van den Berg, P. Vergeer, T.C.G. Rich, S.M. Smart, D. Guest, M.R. Ashmore).
- Published references: extensive documentation and results in Rich et al. (1993), Van Den Berg et al. (2011), and related works; final dataset entry in Rich et al. (2015).
- Data centre and access: NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) with DOI: 10.5285/38a73c7b-3e3c-4517-a33f-bd28b292b9e1.
- Data files (CG_SITES.csv, CG_VEG.csv):
  - CG_SITES.csv: site-level information (SITE, YEAR, OS grid references, NVC, soil properties, altitude, aspect, slope, coastal/ scree indicators, and various soil chemical measurements).
  - CG_VEG.csv: vegetation occurrence data (PLOT_ID, YEAR, SPECIES_REC, BRC_NUM/NAME, COUNT, GROWTH class).
- Metadata and documentation accompany the datasets, including units, data types, and data provenance notes.

## Practical considerations for data stewards
- Ensure continued accessibility and traceability through the NERC EIDC DOI; maintain links to primary publications.
- Preserve grid and marker-based relocation information to support potential re-surveys or longitudinal studies.
- Maintain metadata on site management, grazing intensity, and ownership to contextualize vegetation dynamics.
- Note that direct comparability with other vegetation datasets may be limited due to the unique sampling design and frequency-based recording approach.
