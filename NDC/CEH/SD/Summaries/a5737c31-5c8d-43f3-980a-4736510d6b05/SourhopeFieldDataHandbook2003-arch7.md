# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Provides soil and vegetation data for Sourhope field site (Blocks 4 and 5, plus Ecotron plots) to support map- and data-driven analyses.
- Data support long-term, GIS-enabled biodiversity, soil health, and habitat mapping across multiscale plots (blocks, plots, subplots) with historical context from ECN and related studies.

## Spatial framework and data structure
- Block 4: Plots 4A–4F with multiple subplots per plot (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Pe, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc) and detailed vegetation/soil data per auger sample.
- Block 5: Plots 5A–5F with subplots Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm Je Lm Lzm Mc Ns Pe Pp Pt Ra Rr Rs Tr Vc; extensive soil and vegetation data by subplot and horizon.
- ECOTRON PLOT and ECOTRON SITE included to capture controlled experiments and integrated measurements.
- Block 5 site details: grid NT8544019520, ~315 m ASL, 5° slope, imperfect drainage; Brown Forest soils with gleying; parent materials include andesite/igneous rocks.
- Data are organized by block, plot, subplot, and horizon (for soils) with barcode IDs for traceability and GIS integration.

## Data collected and measurement types
- Soil analyses (auger samples and horizons)
  - Variables per sample: weight (mg), %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (all as meq/100 g where applicable), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Block 4 exemplars (plots 4A–4F): N ~0.51–0.58%, C ~6.80–8.02%, C:N ~12.6–14.3, Ca ~1.01–2.96 meq/100 g, Mg ~0.58–1.59 meq/100 g, LOI ~14–17%, pH(H2O) ~4.45–4.82, pH(CaCl2) ~3.64–4.05.
  - Block 5 exemplars (plots 5A–5F): broader ranges with higher LOI in some horizons; N ~0.53–0.62%, C ~7.0–9.0%, C:N ~10.0–14.7, Ca up to ~5.08 meq/100 g, Mg up to ~5.92 meq/100 g, %Moisture loss up to ~9.4%, pH(H2O) ~4.34–5.20, pH(CaCl2) ~3.53–4.48.
  - Block 5 profile data include horizon designations FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with horizon-specific properties and descriptive soil profiles.
- Vegetation surveys
  - Block 4 and Block 5 plots recorded species presence/absence and abundance hints across subplots (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Pe, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc, etc.).
  - Data presented as per-plot and per-subplot totals, enabling comparisons of community composition and indicator species.
- ECOTRON data
  - ECOTRON PLOT: soil analysis (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2)).
  - ECOTRON PLOT vegetation survey with per-subplot totals and presence/absence indicators for key species.
- Data quality and traceability
  - Each measurement tied to MLURI barcodes; data are designed for GIS workflows with explicit plot, subplot, horizon coding, and species indicators.
  - Appendices in the broader document provide detailed per-block, per-plot, per-horizon datasets and laboratory results.

## Vegetation data highlights
- Block 4 vegetation data reflect multiple species across plots with totals suggesting dominant communities and indicator species; data support classification against NVC communities (e.g., U4d and U5b variants in the broader document context).
- Block 5 vegetation data capture subplots with diverse species totals across Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm Je Lm Lzm Mc Ns Pe Pp Pt Ra Rr Rs Tr Vc, enabling finer-scale habitat mapping and change detection.
- ECOTRON vegetation data provide a controlled reference for comparing natural versus experimental conditions.

## GIS relevance and potential uses
- Multiscale spatial framework: five blocks, multiple plots, and numerous subplots suitable for high-resolution habitat mapping and time-series analyses.
- Integrated datasets: combines soil properties (horizons and depths) with vegetation composition to model soil-vegetation interactions and habitat classifications.
- Horizon-level soil profiles and horizon-coded data enable soil mapping, fertility zoning, and drainage/infiltration modeling.
- Barcode-anchored data support robust data provenance, enabling reproducibility and cross-site comparisons within GIS environments.

## Key considerations for use
- Data heterogeneity across blocks and horizons; variability in pH, LOI, Ca/Mg, and other soil properties by horizon and block.
- Missing values present in some subplot records; some horizons have sparse or incomplete data for certain elements.
- Horizon descriptions and profile details (Block 5) provide important context for interpretation of bulk soil metrics and spatial patterns.

## Summary of GIS-ready insights
- The dataset offers a rich, spatially explicit basis for mapping vegetation types, soil fertility, and moisture regimes across Sourhope’s upland grasslands.
- Enables multiscale habitat classification, soil-health assessment, and long-term change detection when integrated with time-series data and other site measurements.
