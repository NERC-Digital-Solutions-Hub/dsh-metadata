# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview of Content (Block 4–5 and Ecotron data)

- Documents detailed soil profiles, chemical analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on Blocks 4 and 5 and the ECOTRON plot.
- Provides horizon-by-horizon descriptions (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with color, texture, structure, moisture, roots, and stone content.
- Captures soil chemistry (percent N and C, C:N ratios, Ca, Na, K, Mg in meq/100 g), moisture loss, loss on ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2) across horizons and sub-samples.
- Includes auger-sample datasets (4A–4F, 5A–5F) with parallel chemical and physical measurements.
- Contains vegetation survey data at plot and subplot levels, listing species totals and indicator taxa where available.
- Adds an Ecotron plot with a complete, compact set of soil and vegetation data for cross-plot comparisons.

## Site Context and Layout

- Location: Rigg Foot, Sourhope; Block 4 and Block 5 sites described with depth profiles and horizon sequences.
- Site details (Block 5 example): Grid reference NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; imperfect drainage; soil series Sourhope; parent igneous/andesitic materials.
- Ecotron plot: An experimental subdivision used for controlled environment studies, with parallel soil analyses and vegetation surveys to support integrated monitoring.

## Soil Profiling and Analysis (Blocks 4 and 5)

- Depths and horizons:
  - Profiles include LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm or 4–8 cm in some plots), H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, with boundary descriptions (smooth, wavy) and color transitions.
  - Soils show organic-rich surface horizons transitioning to brownish to reddish-brown mineral horizons; presence of iron/mottling and substantial igneous stones in several horizons.
- Physical and chemical characteristics:
  - %N and %C vary by horizon and block, with C:N ratios typically in the teens to low 20s in surface horizons and lower in deeper horizons.
  - Base cations (Ca, Mg, K) and trace ions (Na) measured; Ca often high in humic horizons, Na generally low.
  - Moisture loss and LOI indicate organic content and moisture characteristics higher near the surface.
  - pH values typically acidic, with pH(H2O) around 4.5–5.0 and pH(CaCl2) around 3.8–4.2 in many horizons.
- Data nuances and QA considerations:
  - Block-to-block variability evident in some horizons; certain horizons have missing Na measurements in a subset of samples.
  - Rich presence of igneous stones (andesite) across several horizons, influencing texture and mineral composition.
  - Boundary clarity and horizon induration vary, underscoring the need for careful horizon delineation in analyses.

## Auger Sampling and Depth Profiling

- Auger samples (4A–4F, 5A–5F) provide micro-scale depth-wise chemistry and physical data:
  - %N and %C values across auger segments show horizon-dependent variation.
  - C:N ratios, Ca, Mg, K, Na, and moisture-related metrics reported per auger sample.
  - pH measurements in both water and CaCl2 conditions accompany each sample set.
- Data utility:
  - Enables fine-scale interpretation of horizon processes, C/N dynamics, and buffering capacity across micro-sites within Blocks 4 and 5.
  - Supports interpretation of how horizon composition relates to vegetation patterns and management practices.

## Vegetation Surveys (Blocks 4 and 5; Ecotron)

- Plot and sub-plot level surveys record species presence/absence and totals:
  - Data tables show species totals per plot/subplot and indicate which plots contain indicator species.
  - Ecotron plot provides a compact vegetation tally to compare with field plots under controlled conditions.
- Vegetation responses:
  - Recurrent patterns of species distributions tied to horizon chemistry, soil texture, and moisture regimes.
  - Indicator taxa (as highlighted in broader Sourhope findings) help reflect habitat quality and soil-vegetation interactions.

## Data Management, Metadata, and Accessibility

- Data governance:
  - Data are part of a structured, replicated field experiment designed for long-term environmental monitoring.
  - Archiving practices and clear documentation enable cross-plot comparisons and longitudinal analyses.
- Metadata considerations:
  - Horizon-level descriptions, depth intervals, sampling dates, and laboratory methods are documented to support reproducibility.
  - Some blocks show data gaps (e.g., Na values missing in certain horizons) underscoring the need for robust QA/QC and complete metadata.
- Community and network integration:
  - Sourhope forms a core element of long-term environmental monitoring networks, contributing to consistent, interoperable datasets.
  - Data are compatible with broader programs examining soil-vegetation interactions under grazing and land management.

## Implications for Monitoring Framework Authors

- Multi-dimensional data enable robust environmental health measures:
  - Combines soil chemistry and physics with vegetation surveys to assess policy-relevant outcomes and drivers.
  - Horizon-level analysis provides insight into ongoing soil processes and nutrient dynamics under field management.
- Design and governance lessons:
  - Standardized sampling designs with replicated blocks and systematic horizon sequencing support cross-site comparability.
  - Integration with long-term networks (ECN) and centralized archiving ensures data integrity and longitudinal capability.
  - Detailed metadata and transparent QA/QC processes are critical to interpret anomalies and ensure data usefulness.
- Practical challenges:
  - Managing block-to-block variability and horizon-specific results requires careful statistical treatment.
  - Ensuring complete data sharing and addressing era-specific barriers (e.g., data access, openness) informs current and future monitoring governance.

## Key Takeaways for Monitoring Framework Authors

- A well-structured, multi-modal field data handbook (soil profiles, chemical analyses, auger sampling, and vegetation surveys) provides a robust foundation for policy-relevant environmental health monitoring.
- Long-term networks and archival storage are essential for detecting trends and attributing changes to management or environmental drivers.
- Rich metadata, standardized methods, and explicit data governance reduce duplication, enhance comparability, and bolster the credibility of monitoring outputs.
- Anticipated data challenges include horizon-level heterogeneity, data gaps, and ensuring timely data sharing, all of which should be addressed in monitoring framework design.
