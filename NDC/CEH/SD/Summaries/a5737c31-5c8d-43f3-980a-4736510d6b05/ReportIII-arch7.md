# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders, under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide context and data for related studies via broad-scale monitoring across plots with different treatments.
- Experimental design includes multiple blocks, plot treatments (e.g., Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen + Lime, Biocide) and unimproved controls; spatial heterogeneity observed across the site.
- Data collection across 1999–2001 with methods including biomass harvesting, botanical surveys, soil pH measurements, and automatic weather data; site management affected by external events (notably FMD in 2001).

## Data collected and methods (key components)
- Automatic Weather Station: daily weather data collected on-site; 1999–2001 headline measures (rainfall, radiation, temperature, soil moisture) summarized; 2001 rainfall near long-term average; moisture and temperature showed year-to-year variation.
- Above-ground biomass: measured on 0.5 m2 sub-plots within main plots across five mowing dates per summer; 1999–2001 data show a consistent treatment hierarchy in biomass, with peak production in July/August; 2001 biomass higher than previous years, likely due to personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Soil pH: measured in upper 5 cm; liming raised pH to 6.19 (limed) and 6.38 (N&L plots); nitrogen alone raised pH modestly; control plots remained near baseline (August 1998).
- Botanical composition: July point quadrat surveys (50% of quadrats per surveyor; 2000 vs 2001 comparison); 58% more hits in 2001 than 2000; species abundance shifted with treatments; 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in Nitrogen + Lime; notable shifts include declines in Agrostis capillaris and increases in Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in fertilised plots; diversity appears to decline in more improved plots.
- Data analysis: PCA used to explore plot-by-treatment community differences; correlations drawn between species hits and biomass (e.g., Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline as biomass increases).

## Key results by data type

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline measures: rainfall ~839 mm; total radiation ~3473 MJ/m2; average temperatures slightly lower than prior years; soil moisture content modestly higher; weather patterns compared to 1999–2000.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Consistent treatment hierarchy in biomass across sampling periods.
- Peak biomass vždy in July/August.
- 2001 saw a substantial biomass increase versus earlier years, attributed to personnel changes and switch to mechanical cutting.
- Normalising by C1 showed continued positive impact of nitrogen and/or lime on productivity.
- ANOVA (log-transformed biomass): significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effect.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Liming raises soil pH persistently; October 2001 values: limed plots ~6.19, N&L plots ~6.38.
- Nitrogen alone also raises pH but less than lime.
- Control plots show little change from baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- 2001 survey showed no significant surveyor effect.
- 58% more total hits in 2001 than 2000, indicating denser sward, possibly from grazing removal in 1998.
- Species-level changes: Agrostis capillaris declines across treatments in 2001; Festuca ovina and Festuca rubra increase across treatments; improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) more apparent in fertilised plots, especially N and Lime.
- Diversity: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen + Lime, suggesting potential early decline in diversity with more intensive improvement.
- PCA: improved plots (N and/or Lime) cluster separately from unimproved plots; unimproved plots associate with bryophytes and Nardus stricta; improved plots show stronger association with Festuca rubra and related grasses.
- Biomass association: higher abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis linked with greater biomass; abundance of litter increases with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed; columns E and F (slope-facing) tended to have more acidic plots, partly due to higher proportion of Control or Biocide plots in those columns.
- Underlying spatial pattern suggests pH and plant community composition vary across the site beyond simple treatment effects.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Outlying plots with the lowest biomass exist across treatments; central plots often show higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen + Lime, Lime, Biocide, Control 1 in central locations).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant difference in biomass between blocks, indicating within-site spatial structure rather than block-level effects.

## GIS and data integration implications

- The study yields a rich, spatially explicit dataset: plot-level treatments across a mapped site, with per-plot biomass, soil pH, species composition, and weather data over multiple years.
- Opportunities for GIS: create layer stacks for treatment type, biomass density, soil pH, and species dominance; map spatial heterogeneity (e.g., pH vs biomass) and identify influential columns (E/F) and central plots.
- Temporal aspect: year-to-year comparisons (1999–2001) enable change detection in biomass and plant communities; PCA outputs can be translated into spatially referenced plots for visualization.
- Data integration considerations: variability in measurement dates, measurement methodologies (e.g., 0.5 m2 quadrats; point quadrats; mowing records) and site management events (FMD restrictions) should be accounted for in GIS-driven analyses.

## Notable events and management notes

- 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited site access; essential management activities proceeded under protocol after initial restrictions.
- Change of Officer in Charge in May 2001; one biocide application was missed in May 2001, while subsequent applications proceeded as planned.
