# Soil protozoan diversity data from Sourhope field experiment site, Scotland, 1999-2000 [NERC Soil Biodiversity Programme]

## Overview and aims
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; an intensive single-site study to understand soil protozoan diversity and its functional roles in carbon and nitrogen turnover.
- Aims to link protozoan community structure to soil processes and productivity within a long-running field experiment.

## Study site and sampling design
- Location: Sourhope field experiment site, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute (James Hutton Institute), southern Scotland; upland temperate mineral soils.
- Design: 5 blocks with 6 main plots each (30 main plots total); sampling within a 2×2 m sub-plot per plot; randomized sampling locations.
- Sampling timeline: March 2, May 4, July 7, September 7, 1999 and July 17, 2000; samples collected within 24 hours; stock excluded since 1998.
- Soil depth: 5 cm; samples processed to assess protozoan abundance and diversity.

## Datasets and variables
- Dataset 1050: All protozoa abundance (live and dead tests, direct/indirect counts) in 25 re-wetted soil samples from a single occasion.
- Dataset 1051: All protozoa abundance across six occasions (1999–2000) in 25 plots; includes naked amoebae, flagellates, testate amoebae, and ciliates with direct/indirect counts and averages.
- Dataset 1052: Protozoa species size distribution by cell length class (12 size classes) across six occasions.
- Dataset 1053: Protozoa size distribution by sampling occasion (six dates) and soil plots; includes naked amoebae, flagellates, testate amoebae, and ciliates with per-size-class abundances.
- Dataset 1054: Protozoan species diversity by plot; presence/absence (occurrence) of protozoan groups, genera, and species across six occasions; includes number of plots where each species was detected.
- Dataset 130_PROTOZOAN_SPEC_DIVERSITY.csv referenced within 1054 as part of species diversity documentation.

- Units and descriptors: counts per gram of oven-dried soil or per gram dry weight; air-dried soil status for many measurements; detailed field and laboratory processing notes accompany each dataset.

## Methods and processing
- Field/soil processing: core and sub-sample collection; air-dried soil preparation; incubation and enumeration protocols for different protozoan groups.
- Protozoan enumeration: testate amoebae (live and empty tests) after staining; naked amoebae and flagellates (direct/indirect) using growth in nutrient-enriched wells; ciliates enumerated from runoff samples; results expressed per gram dry weight.
- Laboratory: analyses conducted at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Windermere, Cumbria.
- Size-class and species data: size distributions summarized into classes; species diversity captured by presence/absence and abundance across plots and dates.

## Quality control and governance
- Quality control steps included numeric range checks, formatting checks, and logical integrity checks.
- Data are QA’d but the National Environment Research Council (NERC) cannot guarantee accuracy or fitness for a particular use; liability for data use is disclaimed.
- Data documentation is extensive, including data dictionaries and metadata describing variables, sampling dates, plot structure, treatments, and units.

## Practical relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a comprehensive approach to environmental health monitoring data: explicit sampling design, standardized protocols, and multi-level datasets (abundance, size distribution, and diversity by plot).
- Highlights the importance of rich metadata and data dictionaries to enable data reuse, cross-study comparisons, and integration into monitoring dashboards or governance reports.
- Illustrates common data governance considerations for monitoring frameworks: data openness, provenance, quality assurance, and clear disclosure of limitations and liability.
