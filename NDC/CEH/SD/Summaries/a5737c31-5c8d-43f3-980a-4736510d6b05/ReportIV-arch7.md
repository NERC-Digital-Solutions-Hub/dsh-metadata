# SUMMARY

## Context and Aims
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on above-ground productivity, plant community composition, and diversity in a managed grassland.
- Emphasis on understanding links between above- and below-ground processes, with botanical monitoring integrated alongside soil biodiversity research.

## Spatial Design and Treatments
- Field site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, 5 replicate blocks along downslope environmental gradients.
- Each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; data are collected in 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells within sub-plots S, T, U, V.
- Treatments at plot level (5 main treatments + control variants):
  - Control 1 (no treatment)
  - Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen
  - Lime
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA)
- Site-wide management: monthly mowing May–Sept to ≈6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing on insecticide plots; fertilisers applied in spring as per treatment schedule.

## Data Collected (variables and methods)
- Weather: continuous data from on-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999.
- Above-ground productivity: biomass harvests from randomly chosen 0.5 m2 cells per plot; samples dried and weighed.
- Baseline and longitudinal vegetation surveys:
  - 0.5 m2 point quadrats with 25-point baseline (1998) and annual July/August point analyses (2000, 2001, 2002) using a 100-hole grid with a pin dropped through 25 holes.
  - Bryophyte identification to species level (2002) plus mosses and liverworts noted across surveys.
- Plant community analysis: species hits per treatment; functional grouping via CSR (competitiveness, stress-tolerance, ruderal) and SR/CSR categories; Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of species hits.
- Soil and moisture: soil pH measured at ~5 cm depth (H2O); theta probe for soil moisture in 2002; periodic soil sampling since 1998.
- Additional micro-surveys: biomass sorting by species, cover estimates in small squares, and various project-specific plant surveys.

## Key Findings (highlights)
- Biomass and productivity
  - Fertilised plots (N, Lime, N&L) show higher productivity across years; N&L plots remain most productive, though signs of potential peak in these plots by 2002.
  - Biomass productivity declined in 2002 across most treatments relative to 2001; strongest declines observed in Control 2.
  - Slope position influenced productivity: lower blocks (e.g., Block 1) showed larger declines than lower-sloped blocks.
- Plant community composition
  - Mowing effect: Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by >40% since 2000 across all treatments; Festuca rubra expanded, especially in lime- and nitrogen-enriched plots; bryophytes expanded broadly, aided by a ~6 cm sward height from mowing.
  - Fertilisation effect: lime markedly increases soil pH toward ~7.0; nitrogen also raises pH modestly; higher pH and potentially lower soil moisture in fertilised plots correlate with biomass responses.
  - Insecticide effect: possible link between reduced herbivory and higher plant diversity, though causality remains cautious due to limited direct data on insect control efficacy.
  - Trampling effect: first-year sampling in C2 plots (post-13CO2 pulses) suggests trampling contributed to lower productivity in those plots.
- Functional and diversity changes
  - CSR and SR/CSR functional groups shift with treatments: N&L plots show dominance shifts toward C-S-R species; stress-tolerant (S) species increase in unfertilised plots; SR/CSR species decline with lime and insecticide; overall, three functional groups accounted for a large majority of observed species hits.
  - Shannon Diversity Index: 2002 index decreased by about 15% in N&L plots relative to baseline, while other treatments showed increases (up to ~29% in some insecticide-treated plots).
- Species distributions and bryophytes
  - Point-analysis reveals distinct treatment-associated patterns: improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) dominate N&L plots; unimproved plots show higher frequencies of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increased across the site, with relative suppression in some high-nutrient or lime-treated plots; bryophyte contribution to total hits and biomass increased over 2000–2002, particularly in unimproved plots.
- Relationships among soil, moisture, and productivity
  - Lime markedly increases soil pH; nitrogen has smaller positive effect.
  - Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (higher pH associated with lower moisture in treated plots).
  - Across all treatments, a positive link between higher soil pH and biomass was observed when considering all plots together, though this relationship varied within individual treatments (sometimes turning negative when both nitrogen and lime were applied).

## Data and GIS-Relevant Implications
- Spatial structure enables mapping of biomass by plot, block, and year, as well as soil properties (pH, moisture) and their relationships with productivity.
- Point-analysis data provide fine-grained spatial layers of species hits at 0.5 m2 cells, enabling spatial distribution maps of dominant grasses (e.g., Festuca rubra vs Agrostis spp.) and bryophyte presence.
- Functional group distributions (S, CSR, SR/CSR) can be spatially represented to visualize ecological strategy shifts across treatments.
- PCA results highlight landscape-scale separation between improved and unimproved plots, useful for GIS-based classification and change detection.
- Time-series data (1999–2002) support dynamic mapping of treatment effects on biomass, species composition, and diversity, with potential gap-filling notes due to 2002 weather-station data issues.

## Data Notes, Gaps, and Quality Considerations
- Longitudinal data span from 1998 baseline through 2002; 2002 weather data have documented gaps due to a station malfunction (temporary substitution with nearby station data for missing dates).
- A large, multi-project dataset (11621 soil samples to date) with diverse data types (biomass, species hits, pH, moisture, bryophyte lists) suitable for multi-layer GIS analyses and integrative mapping.

## References and Appendices (context for GIS use)
- Core references include Grime’s CSR framework, Hulme et al. on grazing impacts, and related plant functional-type literature.
- Appendices provide detailed site maps, treatment layouts, species lists (including bryophytes), weather data, biomass datasets, and point-analysis results, enabling replication of GIS layers and methodological transparency.
