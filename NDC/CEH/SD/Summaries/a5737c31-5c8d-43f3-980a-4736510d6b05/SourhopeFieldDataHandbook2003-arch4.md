# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Documents Sourhope Soil Biodiversity field site used for long-term soil and vegetation studies within the Soil Biodiversity Programme.
- Integrates site data with ECN (Environmental Change Network) and Micronet initiatives; supports ecological research across grassland systems.
- Aims to support understanding of soil-plant-microbial interactions under management perturbations and to inform broader grassland ecosystem knowledge.

## Study Site and Design
- Location: Sourhope Experimental Farm, Sourhope, Scotland; five blocks (1–5) across upland grassland; Ecotron plot at Silwood Park included in design.
- Layout: 30 plots (12 x 20 m) in five blocks, each subdivided into six subplots; randomized treatments within blocks (e.g., Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Lime & Nitrogen, Biocide); early fallow option omitted after testing.
- Management: regular mowing to simulate grazing; grazing excludes; some small animal interactions noted (rabbits, roe deer).
- Purpose: investigate soil-vegetation interactions under perturbations; support multiple projects (soil-microbial-plant relations; nutrient interactions).

## Data Collected and Methods
- Vegetation data
  - Sampling: 50 x 50 cm point quadrats in five randomly chosen subplots per main plot; 25 points per quadrat; presence/absence with potential abundance cues.
  - Analyses: Twinspan grouping, National Vegetation Classification (NVC) with emphasis on unit U4d; association analyses.
  - Outputs: species occurrence/diversity per plot and block; dominant species lists; community associations.
- Soil data
  - Sampling: 30 auger cores (0–30 cm) per plot in W-patterns; horizon descriptions via profile pits; samples archived at -80°C.
  - Analyses: major chemical and physical properties across horizons (e.g., %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; LOI; moisture; pH in H2O and CaCl2).
  - Outputs: horizon-resolved soil chemistry and physical properties; block- and plot-level summaries; detailed Appendix and Tables.
- Data management and infrastructure
  - Storage: assets on MLURI main server; long-term archived samples.
  - Identifiers: samples tracked via MLURI barcodes; block- and plot-level datasets maintained (Appendix A).
  - Collaboration and reuse: data contributed to ECN/Micronet; used to address soil-plant-microbial interactions and management responses.

## Data Quality, Variability, and Challenges
- Coverage: vegetation sampling covers five of fifteen subplots per main plot; site-wide guidance rather than exhaustive coverage.
- Variability: notable block-to-block and horizon-to-horizon differences in soil chemistry and pH; Blocks 4–5 sometimes show anomalous results needing careful interpretation.
- Temporal and climate context: established 1998; climate context drawn from ECN Sourhope Farm station.
- Analytical integration: core species and patterns emerge from Twinspan and NVC analyses; links between soil properties and vegetation patterns highlighted.

## Key Ecological Findings (High-Level)
- Vegetation
  - Dominant grasses include Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta.
  - NVC classification largely aligns with U4d grassland, with moister plots showing some U5b associations.
  - Species associations reveal edge vs. interior plot differences and co-occurrence with less-dominant taxa (e.g., Deschampsia, Ranunculus, Carex binervis, Juncus spp.).
- Soil
  - Surface horizons are acidic to humic; LOI and moisture higher in near-surface horizons; horizon-specific pH and cation gradients observed.
  - Block-scale gradients in exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K) and base cations; depth- and horizon-dependent variation.
  - Multivariate analyses show strong relationships among N, C, moisture, LOI, and major cations; principal components indicate broad covariation among soil properties.

## Data Use, Utility, and Community
- Long-term monitoring framework: designed to provide baseline and trend data for grassland soil biodiversity and plant dynamics under perturbations.
- Modelling and policy relevance: supports exploration of soil-vegetation interactions under nutrient and liming regimes; informs sustainable hill-grazed systems.
- Collaboration and dissemination: linked with ECN Micronet and SERAD/NERC programmes; data and reports accessible via ECN-related portals and MLURI archives.

## Appendix and Data Details
- Appendix A: block- and plot-level data with site details, profile descriptions, and comprehensive tabulations of nutrient contents, pH, LOI, moisture loss, and plant inventories.
- Tables and figures: extensive data views (Tables 6–9, Appendix tables) spanning block- to plot-scale summaries; includes species inventories, dominance tables, and horizon-specific soil chemistry.
