# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Purpose: provide a consistent monitoring framework to context and compare environmental health and policy-relevant outputs over time.
- Monitoring outputs include above-ground biomass, soil pH, botanical composition, and environmental measurements; data are quality-assured, transformed, and stored for access via appropriate portals.
- The report follows a standardised presentation to facilitate cross-year comparisons and links with other studies.

## 1999–2001 Data Collection and Context
- Data collection spanned multiple plots and treatments with regular measurements (mowing, biomass, soil pH, botanical surveys) and a dedicated Automatic Weather Station.
- 2001 site management was affected by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD): restricted visitor access Feb–May; operations resumed under a veterinary protocol; first biocide application in May was missed.
- A change of site officer occurred in May 2001, but core management activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued according to the 2001 Site Management Plan.

## 2001 Highlights by Topic

### 1) Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data were generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall (about 839 mm) close to long-term expectations; annual radiation ~3473 MJ/m2; average air and soil temperatures slightly lower than previous years.
- Average soil moisture content higher in 2001 than earlier years.

### 2) Above-ground Biomass
- Consistent hierarchy of biomass among treatments; peak biomass occurred in July–August each year.
- 2001 biomass estimates increased substantially compared with 2000, likely due to a combination of staff changes and the switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- After normalising against the control (C1), nitrogen (N) and/or lime (L) treatments showed the strongest positive impact on productivity.
- ANOVA on biomass (log-transformed) revealed:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) versus unimproved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.

### 3) Soil pH
- Liming continued to raise surface soil pH (0–5 cm depth): October 2001 pH ≈ 6.19 in limed plots; ≈ 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots did not show significant pH change since baseline (August 1998).

### 4) Botanical Composition
- Point Quadrat survey in July 2001 showed high data consistency between surveyors; no significant inter-surveyor difference.
- Total “hits” in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000, indicating increased vegetation density, possibly due to reduced grazing since 1998.
- Treatment effects on species abundance:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 (except persists as most abundant in some unimproved plots).
  - Festuca spp. (ovica and rubra) increased across treatments, especially in fertilised plots.
  - Fertilised plots (N and/or L) showed higher occurrences of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots dominated by species typical of poorer pastures (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
- Species richness: unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) contained 24 species, while Nitrogen & Lime plots contained 18, suggesting a starting decline in diversity with the most improved plots.
- Multivariate analysis (PCA) indicated:
  - Clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Improved plots often represented more extreme positions in PCA space.
- Biomass correlations with species:
  - Positive correlations: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis with biomass.
  - Negative correlations: Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) with biomass.
  - Increased litter observed in N and/or Lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity and Spatial Patterns
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F displayed more acidic conditions, though this is partly influenced by plot composition (many Controls or Biocide plots in those columns).
- Biomass varied by location within the site, with higher biomass generally in more central plots (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime, Lime, Biocide). Outliers in 2001 had lower biomass in several plots.
- A strong positive correlation existed between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant differences among blocks.

## Data Quality and Documentation
- Inter-surveyor reliability shown to be high; 2001 point quadrat surveys produced consistent results between surveyors.
- Data were collected across multiple projects (e.g., project 2113 and 2133), with a coordinated weather data feed to a central data manager.
- Detailed measurement schedules and methods (e.g., timed mowing, soil sampling, and point quadrat protocol) were maintained to support cross-year analyses.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring
- Fertilisation and liming driven management practices produce measurable soil chemistry changes (pH rise) and plant community responses (biomass, species shifts).
- Increased biomass on fertilised plots accompanies shifts toward species associated with improved pastures (F. rubra, P. pratensis) and reduced diversity in the most improved plots.
- The strong link between soil pH and biomass underscores the importance of soil chemistry as a driver of productivity and community composition.
- Spatial heterogeneity must be accounted for in monitoring and analyses, as location within an experimental site influenced both pH and biomass.
- Consistent data collection, quality assurance, and cross-year comparability are essential to monitoring environmental health and policy outcomes.

## Conclusions for Monitoring Practice
- Monitoring systems should continue standardised data collection, including biomass, soil pH, and plant community surveys, with explicit attention to management practices (liming, nitrogen) and their ecological consequences.
- Data integration across years and plots, while accounting for spatial heterogeneity, enhances the ability to assess environmental health and the effectiveness of management interventions.
- Documentation of experimental changes (staff, mowing methods, disease-related access limits) is critical for interpreting year-to-year variations in environmental outputs.
