# SUMMARY

- Context: Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) focused on linking soil biodiversity with above-ground plant productivity, composition, and diversity under a controlled field experiment.

- Experimental design: Rigg Foot site with 5 blocks, 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots. Treatments include two controls (Control 1 and Control 2), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen plus Lime (N&L), and Insecticide. Site-wide mowing to ~6 cm monthly (May–Sept) and annual applications of nitrogen and/or lime; insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) applied to designated plots after mowing. Data collected across 1998–2002 with multiple specialized surveys.

- Data collected and datasets (representative types):
  - Weather: On-site Automatic Weather Station data (rainfall, temperature, radiation, soil moisture at various depths).
  - Productivity: Above-ground biomass per plot (May–Sept, across five cuts each summer; yearly totals; ln-transformed analyses).
  - Soil chemistry and moisture: Soil pH (approx. 5 cm depth), soil moisture (theta probe) in botanical sampling cells.
  - Botanical surveys: Baseline 1998 survey; annual July/August point analysis surveys (2000–2002) using 0.5 m2 cells with a 100-hole grid; bryophyte and liverwort identification (2002 enhanced to species level).
  - Vegetation metrics: Species hits by treatment, diversity indices (Shannon), and functional-group classifications (stress tolerators S, competitive-stress-ruderals CSR, SR/CSR, etc).
  - Appendices: Species lists, biomass tabulations, weather data, point-analysis outputs, and PCA loadings.

- Key findings (overall patterns and 2002 highlights):
  - Productivity trends: Long-term rise in biomass across treatments since 1999, with nitrogen and lime together giving the strongest productivity boost; Control 2 plots consistently less productive; 2002 shows a general drop in biomass across most treatments relative to 2001, with block- and slope-related variation (lower productivity at lower slope blocks).
  - Fertilization effects: Nitrogen and/or lime improve productivity; potential peak in plots treated with both N and lime, possibly linked to higher soil pH and drier conditions, while moisture stress may limit gains in some plots.
  - Mowing effects: Regular mowing and absence of grazing favored stress-tolerant and bryophyte expansion; decline of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis observed across years, potentially due to mowing regime and disturbance differences vs grazing.
  - Insecticide effects: Insecticide plots show higher plant diversity in some years; possible link between reduced herbivory and increased palatable species, though causality is not definitively established.
  - Bryophyte dynamics: Bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increase across the site and are particularly prominent in unimproved plots; mosses contribute substantially to total vegetation and biomass in some years.
  - Functional-group shifts: Fertilized plots (N and/or lime) shift towards competitive, less stressed plant types; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerators; SR/CSR groups decrease in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
  - Species composition: Festuca rubra expands in fertilized/fertile plots; Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp. decline; relative abundance patterns shift with pH and nutrient status. PCA of point-analysis data demonstrates clear separation between improved and unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots forming distinct clusters.
  - Soil chemistry and productivity link: A strong positive relation between soil pH and biomass when all treatments are considered; the pH-moisture relationship under different treatments suggests nuanced interactions (e.g., higher pH correlates with higher biomass, but the relationship weakens or reverses in some N-only or N+L plots).

- Data quality and caveats:
  - 2002 weather data includes a partial outage period; where needed, data from a nearby station (Konza) supplemented after identifying the outage.
  - Biomass estimates and statistical analyses include transformations (log) and ANOVA to account for experimental design (split-plot, year-by-treatment interactions).
  - point-analysis experiences inter-observer comparability checks; species identifications improved in 2002 ( bryophytes to species level ), enabling more precise diversity assessments.

- Implications for data governance and stewardship:
  - Rich, multi-layered datasets spanning 1998–2002 require clear data dictionaries, standardized metadata, and stable long-term storage to support reuse by diverse end-users (ecologists, data scientists, land-management partners).
  - Data types include longitudinal biomass, soil chemistry, microhabitat surveys, species-level lists (vascular plants and bryophytes), and functional-type classifications; all should be catalogued with consistent units, sampling schemes, and spatial schemas (plots, blocks, sub-plots, time points).
  - Documentation should capture: site management events (mowing schedule, fertilizer rates, lime applications, insecticide timing), instrumentation (weather station calibration), data provenance (PI/project attribution), and data processing steps (transformations, normalizations, PCA loadings).
  - Accessibility: The Soil Biodiversity programme website and appendices provide comprehensive datasets, species lists, and analysis outputs; ensure that data are archived with open, machine-readable formats and accompanied by a machine-readable metadata schema.

- Data availability and next steps for stewardship:
  - Core datasets and appendices (biomass by plot, point-analysis results, bryophyte lists, soil/pH data, weather statistics) are available through the Soil Biodiversity project resources and partner institutions; consider formal data curation, DOIs for datasets, and a centralized data dictionary to support cross-study reuse and meta-analyses.
  - Recommend establishing a data governance plan that includes data dictionaries for plot-level treatments, measurement protocols (sampling, drying, and weighing), and data quality checks; ensure versioning, access controls, and clear licensing for data reuse.
