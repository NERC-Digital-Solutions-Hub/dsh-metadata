# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Four years into the Sourhope site monitoring as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and relative abundance (diversity).
- Core management actions studied: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and lime), and insecticide application; trampling effects also discussed.
- Tracking approach combines repeated biomass sampling, point quadrat surveys, bryophyte data, soil pH and moisture, and site weather data to understand functional and compositional responses.

## Monitoring framework: indicators and data

- Key indicators
  - Above-ground biomass (productivity) per plot across seasons and years.
  - Botanical composition and diversity (Shannon index) at the site and treatment levels.
  - Functional groups of plants (CSR framework: Competitiveness, Stress-tolerance, Ruderal, and combinations).
  - Bryophyte abundance and species richness.
  - Soil properties: pH and soil moisture; weather data (rainfall, radiation, temperature).
- Data sources and collection
  - 5 replicate blocks with 6 main plots per block; plots subdivided into sub-plots using a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system.
  - Treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide.
  - Monthly mowing (May–Sept) to ~6 cm; biomass harvested from random 0.5 m2 cells; samples oven-dried and weighed (1999–2002).
  - Baseline vegetation survey (July/Aug 1998) and annual point analysis surveys (2000–2002) using 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point frame to record species hits.
  - Soil sampling for pH since 1998; targeted soil moisture (theta probe) in 2002; Automatic Weather Station data collected since Feb 1999.
  - Appendices catalog detailed treatments, species lists, and yearly biomass and point-analysis outputs.
- Data governance and transparency
  - Outputs include extensive appendices (treatment summaries, species lists, biomass time series, PCA loadings). Public sharing of underlying data is a general consideration for monitoring frameworks and is addressed through detailed data documentation.

## Experimental design and data collection

- Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into sub-plots.
- Treatments and management
  - Site-wide mowing: monthly May–Sept to ~6 cm.
  - Plot-level treatments: Nitrogen (NH4NO3), Lime (CaCO3), Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) applied after mowing.
  - Treatment application schedules provided per year (1999–2002).
- Data collection specifics
  - Above-ground productivity: biomass harvested from 0.5 m2 cell in sub-plots S, T, U, V prior to each mow; moisture-dried and weighed (since 1999).
  - Baseline and annual botanical surveys: 25-point baseline; annual 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point quadrats (1998, 2000–2002); bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
  - Soil and moisture: soil pH measurements at ~5 cm depth; theta probe for soil moisture in 2002; on-site weather data.
  - Data analysis: repeated measures across years; ANOVA (split-plot Genstat) to assess treatment, year, and interactions; PCA on point-analysis data to explore community structure.
- Notable data issues
  - 2002 weather data had missing periods due to a station malfunction; proxy data from Konza used for affected dates.

## Key findings by management action

- Mowing effect
  - Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis declines (>40% since 2000) across most treatments.
  - Festuca rubra expands, especially in more fertile (N and/or lime) plots.
  - Bryophytes increase across the site, supported by a ~6 cm sward height from regular mowing and reduced disturbance.
  - Stress-tolerant (S) species increase under most plots; ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderal (SR/CSR) groups tend to decline with disturbance reduction.

- Fertilisation effect
  - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently boosts above-ground biomass; plots with both N and lime show the strongest productivity.
  - Mean soil pH in lime-treated plots rises toward ~7.0 by 2002; high lime and moisture dynamics may constrain productivity in some plots.
  - Productivity trends: long-term increase from 1999 across treatments, with potential plateau or decline in highly limed plots due to high pH and moisture stress.
  - Functional shift: with N+L, CS-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species gain; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerators (S).

- Insecticide effect
  - Shannon diversity highest in insecticide-treated plots, consistent with some theoretical expectations that herbivory changes can alter plant community structure.
  - The link between reduced herbivory and diversity is cautious, given uncertainties about the precise insect-control effects and broader ecological interactions.

- Trampling effect
  - In 2002, C2 plots (which experienced more trampling during 13CO2 pulse events) showed notable productivity reductions, suggesting trampling impacts on vegetation growth.

## Data interpretation and implications for monitoring practice

- Overall pattern
  - Long-term data (1999–2002) show sustained productivity gains with nutrient and lime additions, yet the combined effects of liming and high soil pH may introduce moisture-stress, potentially tempering gains.
  - Disturbance history (grazing exclusion via fencing, followed by mowing) shifts community composition toward stress-tolerant and bryophyte-rich communities, with a parallel decline in certain grass species.
- Functional framework
  - Using CSR-based functional group analysis illuminates how environmental conditions and management drive functional trait distributions, beyond simple species counts.
- Monitoring recommendations for policy and governance
  - Combine traditional productivity metrics with functional-group and bryophyte indicators for a fuller picture of ecosystem responses.
  - Track soil pH and moisture dynamics closely when applying lime and nitrogen fertilisers to anticipate potential moisture stress and nutrient saturation.
  - Include disturbance regime details (grazing exclusion, mowing frequency, trampling) as essential metadata in monitoring frameworks.
  - Ensure robust data handling and metadata standards to support transparent sharing and reuse of datasets (e.g., biomass time series, point-analysis species-hits, species lists, and environmental covariates).
  - Where data gaps occur (e.g., weather station outages), document gaps and apply transparent substitutions or proxies to preserve continuity in monitoring signals.
