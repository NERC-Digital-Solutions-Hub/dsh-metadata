# SUMMARY

- Overview
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders); intensive study of above-ground biomass (productivity), plant species composition, and diversity in a large field experiment.
  - Three main management processes drive botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and insecticide application; additional trampling effects observed in specific plots.
  - Site design: Rigg Foot Experimental Site with 5 replicate blocks, 6 main plots per block, subdivided into sub-plots for 16 Phase I projects (Phase II also involved in 2002). Regular mowing to 6 cm; insecticide (Dursban 4) applied post-mow to designated plots; treatments include Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime, and Insecticide.

- Data collected and methods
  - Above-ground biomass: harvests from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells, oven-dried and weighed (1999–2002).
  - Botanical surveys: 0.5 m2 point quadrats (100-hole frame) in sub-plots S, T, U, V; yearly surveys in 1998 baseline and 2000–2002 follow-ups; bryophyte identification improved in 2002.
  - Soil and microclimate: soil pH (5 cm depth) and moisture; on-site Automatic Weather Station data; occasional detailed measurements (e.g., 13CO2 pulses in some plots); additional small-scale surveys.
  - Data processing: ANOVA (split-plot), PCA, and diversity indices (Shannon) computed; treatment-year interactions examined.

- Key findings by theme
  - Mowing effect
    - Consistent reduction in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across years, suggesting a site-wide response to mowing rather than a specific treatment.
    - Festuca rubra expands, especially in lime- and/or nitrogen-fertilised plots; bryophytes expand broadly, aided by ~6 cm sward height and absence of grazing.
    - Regular mowing plus lack of grazing linked to increased bryophyte abundance and changes in vascular plant composition.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Productivity (above-ground biomass) rises with nitrogen and/or lime; the strongest production in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime (N+L).
    - Productivity in 2002 fell across most treatments relative to 2001; however, long-term rise since 1999 remains when normalised to controls.
    - Soil pH rises with lime (nearing 7.0 in limed plots); nitrogen also increases pH but to a lesser extent. Higher pH correlates with lower soil moisture; complex, treatment-dependent relationships between pH and biomass.
    - Functional group shifts: C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species expand most in N+L plots; stress-tolerant (S) species increase most in unfertilised plots. Overall, N+L plots favor more competitive, faster-growing species, while unfertilised plots favor stress-tolerant assemblages.
  - Insecticide effect
    - Point analyses and community surveys suggest insecticide plots (Dursban) may support higher diversity by reducing herbivore pressure on palatable species, though evidence for a direct causal link to diversity is not definitive.
    - Trends align with broader insect-plant interaction literature: responses depend on insecticide type, plant group, and life history.
  - Trampling effect
    - In 2002, C2 plots (subject to intensive activity for labelled 13CO2 pulses) show reduced productivity, likely due to trampling during peak field activities.
  - Community composition and diversity
    - 2002 point analysis shows higher abundances of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in fertilised plots; unimproved plots remain dominated by Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
    - Bryophytes (especially Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) are increasingly abundant across the site, contributing to a rising share of total hits (19.9% in 2002 vs 10.8% in 2001).
    - Shannon diversity declines in N+L plots by 2002 (about 15% drop from baseline), while increases of 2–29% occur in other treatments; insecticide plots often show higher diversity relative to some controls.
    - PCA differentiates improved (fertilised) vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster distinctly; several nitrogen-treated samples resemble limed plots, indicating converging community characteristics under certain treatments.
  - Functional group dynamics
    - Across years, three main functional groupings (stress-tolerators S; competitive-stress-ruderal CSR and SR/CSR) account for 69–95% of vascular plant hits in a plot.
    - By 2002, N+L plots show expansion of C-S-R species; unimproved plots show strong benefits to stress-tolerant species. SR/CSR species are reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.

- Endnotes and data context
  - Weather and site data indicate variability across years; 2002 experienced some data gaps due to weather-station malfunction, with substituted data from a nearby station for a portion of the year.
  - Total soil samples collected since start: 11,621.
  - The study integrates outputs from multiple projects to understand plant-soil feedbacks and functional ecology, with ongoing data curation and availability (metadata and datasets framed for discovery).

- Implications and considerations for prediction
  - Mowing and grazing exclusion shift plant communities toward stress-tolerant and bryophyte-rich assemblages; ongoing effects depend on disturbance regime and nutrient inputs.
  - Fertilisation enhances productivity but can reduce diversity in nutrient-rich regimes (notably N+L), potentially altering ecosystem function long-term.
  - Lime-driven pH increases interact with soil moisture to influence productivity; high pH combined with ample moisture may reduce productivity under certain conditions.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but require cautious interpretation; interactions with plant traits and herbivore pressure are complex.
  - Trampling and heavy management activities can transiently depress productivity in plots undergoing intense sampling or pulses of ecosystem experiments.

- Takeaways for data-driven decision-making
  - Strong correlations exist between fertilisation (N+L), soil pH, and production; management choices will shift both productivity and community composition through direct nutrient effects and indirect disturbance pathways.
  - Biodiversity metrics (Shannon index, functional-group composition) respond variably to treatments; multi-metric approaches are essential to capture shifts in both species abundances and functional roles.
  - Longitudinal, multi-factor designs (as in Sourhope) are crucial to disentangle treatment effects from site-level factors (e.g., mowing regime, slope position) and to forecast future trajectories under different management scenarios.
