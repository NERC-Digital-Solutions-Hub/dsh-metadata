# SUMMARY

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on above-ground biomass (productivity), species composition and diversity, alongside soil-plant interactions.
  - Site managed with grazing exclusion since 1998 and a five-treatment design (Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime) plus an Insecticide treatment; broad, standardised monitoring of plant communities and productivity.
  - CSR functional-type framework used to interpret shifts in plant traits under different soil and disturbance conditions.

- Methods and site activity
  - Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots with a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system for data allocation.
  - Treatments: site-wide mowing; plot-level treatments of Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Insecticide (Dursban 4); controls without treatment.
  - Data collection: on-site weather data (Automatic Weather Station) since 1999; above-ground biomass from 0.5 m2 samples within sub-plots; baseline botanical survey (1998) plus multi-year point analyses (2000–2002); soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture measured in 2002; additional small surveys and biomass sorting by species; extensive appendices with species lists and treatment summaries.
  - Activity: Phase I fieldwork largely complete by 2002; Phase II ongoing with fieldwork and reporting; data collection totals include over 11,600 soil samples.

- Key results (highlights)
  - Weather (2002): low rainfall in April and September; wetter periods in February, July, and late year; winter 2001/02 unusually mild.
  - Above-ground biomass (2002 vs 2001)
    - Biomass productivity remained highest in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime; Control 2 plots consistently less productive.
    - Overall biomass declined in 2002 relative to 2001 across most treatments, with the steepest decline on Control 2 plots; a clear slope effect with Block 1 showing larger declines than Block 5.
    - Long-term trend (1999–2002) shows an overall increase in biomass across treatments, despite 2002 dips.
  - Soil pH, moisture and productivity
    - Lime dramatically increased soil pH toward ~7 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
    - A strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (r ~ -0.68); higher pH plots tended to be drier.
    - Across all plots, higher pH generally associated with higher biomass, though the strength of this relation varied by treatment. In plots with both nitrogen and lime, the positive pH-biomass relationship weakened and may become negative when moisture stress occurs.
    - Higher soil pH and nutrient availability in fertilised plots promote biomass, with lime- and nitrogen-treated plots showing distinct, more competitive community structure.
  - Point Analysis (species and functional groups, 2002)
    - Improved plots (lime and/or nitrogen) show increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis (roughly 54% of total hits in N&L plots; 25–30% in other fertilised plots) compared with unimproved plots.
    - Unimproved plots show higher hits of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
    - Bryophyte (mosses and liverworts) hits rise across the site, with Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus becoming more common; bryophyte contribution highest in unimproved plots and rising from 2000–2002.
    - Litter hits and biomass show treatment-dependent patterns; Shannon diversity declines in nitrogen & lime plots since 1998 baseline, while increases are observed in several other treatments.
    - Functional group shifts (CSR framework): in 2000–2002, C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) and SR/C-S-R groups become more dominant in fertilised plots (especially N&L), whereas stress-tolerant (S) species increase in unimproved plots; overall, N&L plots show the strongest shift toward competitive-stressful assemblages.
    - A consistent reduction of Agrostis spp. (capillaris and vinealis) across all treatments since 2000, suggesting a mowing-related or site-wide disturbance effect.
    - Mosses expand across the site, possibly promoted by mowing height (~6 cm) and the absence of grazing; this moss expansion dampens density of vascular plants in some contexts.
    - By 2002, the CSR and SR/C-S-R groups show significant treatment effects, reflecting how soil pH, nutrient status and disturbance regime shape functional composition.

- Discussion: interpretation of the main drivers
  - Mowing effect
    - Uniform mowing (no grazing) favors Festuca rubra and stress-tolerant species, while Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline by over 40% since 2000.
    - Bryophyte expansion is linked to reduced disturbance and consistent mowing height; mosses become more prominent, especially where nutrient availability remains moderate.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Nitrogen and lime increase productivity, with the strongest productivity in plots receiving both; however, high lime likely pushes soil pH toward 7 and may reduce soil moisture, potentially limiting growth during dry periods.
    - Elevated pH seems more critical than nitrogen alone for supporting C-S-R species in fertilised plots; nitrogen alone is less effective for promoting these competitive species.
  - Insecticide effect
    - Complex plant-insect interactions with potential links between reduced herbivory and higher diversity are discussed, but direct causality remains uncertain.
    - Observed patterns are consistent with prior work suggesting herbivore exclusion can alter plant community trajectories, but effects depend on insecticide type and plant functional groups.
  - Trampling effect
    - In the C2 plots, intense trampling during 13CO2 pulse experiments likely reduced local productivity, illustrating how disturbance timing can confound biomass measurements.

- Implications for monitoring and data use
  - Management actions (mowing and fertilisation) drive distinct trajectories in productivity and community composition, including functional shifts toward C-S-R in fertilised plots and enhanced moss bryophyte presence with reduced disturbance.
  - Ongoing monitoring should continue to track soil chemistry (pH), moisture, plant functional groups, and bryophyte dynamics as indicators of ecosystem response to management regimes.
  - The dataset supports integrating CSR-based analyses and bryophyte dynamics into environmental monitoring to robustly assess policy and management outcomes over time.
