# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, focused on soil biodiversity and related plant responses.
- Main measured data types: Automatic Weather Station, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical (point quadrat) composition.
- Aimed to provide broad context for other studies, enable year-to-year comparisons, and facilitate data use across topics.
- Treatments include Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Biocide; measurements span 1999–2001 with summer biomass harvests and July botanical surveys.
- 2001 management disruptions (Foot and Mouth disease) and a change in site officer affected sampling logistics.

## Data collection and management
- Measurements and dates summarized in baseline/monitoring plan; data collected via standardized protocols.
- Biomass: five mowing events per summer (May–Sept); 0.5 m2 subplots; clippings dried and weighed; biomass summed annually and ln-transformed for analyses.
- Botanical surveys: July 2000 and 2001 point quadrat method (100 cells per plot); species hits recorded; cross-checks for surveyor consistency.
- Soil pH: measured in upper 5 cm; soil chemistry affected by lime and nitrogen treatments tracked over time.
- Weather: Automatic Weather Station on-site; data regularly downloaded and relayed to data managers at CEH/MLURI.
- Data quality notes: no significant difference between surveyors in 2001; protocols supported by Genstat analyses; some year-to-year comparability adjustments made (e.g., biomass normalization to C1 due to changes in mowing method).

## Key results by data type

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather data generally unremarkable relative to recent years.
- Rainfall around long-term average (839 mm in 2001; previously wetter year).
- Radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than before.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass production across the season; peaks in July–August.
- 2001 biomass significantly higher than in 1999–2000, likely due to a combination of: a change in personnel and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- After normalization to C1, nitrogen and/or lime additions consistently enhanced productivity; nitrogen plus lime often most effective.
- ANOVA shows significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant block effects.
- Biomass correlates with species composition:
  - Positive correlations: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis with biomass.
  - Negative correlations: Agrostis capillaris and several bryophytes as biomass increases.
  - Litter frequency increases in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition raised surface pH (0–5 cm) to about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots by Oct 2001.
- Nitrogen addition alone also raised pH, but less than lime.
- Control plots remained close to baseline pH ( August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- 2001 Point Quadrat results: total hits 58% higher than 2000 across all treatments, suggesting denser sward, possibly due to grazing removal in 1998.
- Species-level changes by treatment:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 (except in some controls).
  - Festuca spp. increased across treatments; particularly Festuca ovina and Festuca rubra in fertilized plots.
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) more apparent in fertilized plots; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in untreated plots.
- Diversity: unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) show 24 species; improved plots (notably Nitrogen & Lime) show 18 species, suggesting possible early decline in diversity with fertility improvements.
- Multivariate analysis (PCA): Fertilized/limed plots separate from unimproved plots; unimproved plots cluster with bryophytes and acid-tolerant species; improved plots are associated with Festuca rubra and related grasses.
- Biomass vs species: higher abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis associated with higher biomass; declines in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes as biomass increases.
- Litter and turnover: increased litter in N and/or Lime plots, consistent with faster turnover under higher fertility.

## Site heterogeneity
- Spatial variation observed across the site:
  - Columns E and F tended to be more acidic than others, potentially due to plot composition (more Controls/Biocide) in those areas.
  - Central plots generally exhibited higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B).
- Biomass shows a strong positive correlation with surface soil pH across plots.
- No significant differences between blocks in biomass, suggesting spatial heterogeneity rather than block effects drives some variation.

## Data quality and considerations for users
- Data linked to multiple year contexts; normalization (e.g., to C1) helps compare across mowing method changes.
- Clear documentation of protocols, measurement timing, and site management events (FMD, staff changes) aids data integration with other studies.
- Evidence of data consistency across observers for the botanical surveys in 2001 supports reliability of the point-quadrat results.
- The FMD-related access restrictions in 2001 affected site visitation and sampling scheduling, which is important for interpreting year-specific results.

## Implications for data users
- Provides baseline context for linking site-level measurements with finer-scale experiments within the NERC Soil Biodiversity programme.
- Enables cross-year comparisons of treatment effects on biomass, soil chemistry (pH), and plant community composition.
- Highlights the influence of management actions (nitrogen, lime, mowing methods) and site heterogeneity on data interpretation.
- Useful for modeling relationships between soil fertility (pH), biomass production, and species composition dynamics under different nutrient and lime regimes.
