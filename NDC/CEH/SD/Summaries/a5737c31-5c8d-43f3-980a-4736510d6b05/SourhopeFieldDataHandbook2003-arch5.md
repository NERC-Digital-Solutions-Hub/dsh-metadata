# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- Overview of contents: Detailed soil profile descriptions and corresponding laboratory analyses for Block 4, including horizon-by-horizon descriptions (LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx), auger samples (4A–4F), and vegetation surveys linked to plots within the block. Also includes an Ecotron component with soil and vegetation data. All data are organized with MLURI barcodes for traceability.

- Data types and structure:
  - Soil profile descriptions by horizon, with depth ranges and qualitative descriptions (color, texture, structure, roots, boundaries).
  - Quantitative soil analyses by horizon: weight (mg), %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100g), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH in water, and pH in CaCl2.
  - Horizon-specific notes include presence/absence of minerals, mottling, structure type (blocky, granular, platy), moisture, root density, and boundary characteristics.
  - Auger samples (4A–4F) with corresponding analyses: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2, and weights.
  - Vegetation surveys by subplot/plot (e.g., PLOT 4A–4F, with Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, etc.), including species totals and presence/absence indicators.
  - Ecotron soil site: single soil analysis per plot and corresponding vegetation survey data.
  - Site context: Block 4 is part of Sourhope with Block 5 data presented for site context, including grid references and soil series notes.

- Provenance and identifiers:
  - Data generated under the Sourhope field program, with MLURI barcodes assigned to each horizon (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and each auger sample (e.g., 4A–4F).
  - ECOTRON plot data linked to MLURI barcode identifiers (e.g., 603930 series for ECOTRON horizons).
  - Plot and subplot identifiers (e.g., PLOT 4A, 4B, etc.) paired with species and soil measurements.

- Measurements and variables (highlights):
  - Horizons and soil descriptions: LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, with depth ranges (0–1 cm up to 100 cm+ in some cases).
  - Chemical/physical soil properties per horizon: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100g); %Moisture loss; %LOI; pH(H2O); pH(CaCl2).
  - Auger samples (4A–4F): %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %LOI; pH(H2O); pH(CaCl2).
  - Vegetation data: per-subplot totals for multiple species indicators (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, D, F, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc, etc.), including counts where provided.
  - Ecotron plot data: soil analysis (Wt mg, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2) and vegetation totals.

- Site details and cross-block context:
  - Block 4 soil profile shows a multi-horizon sequence with distinct color/mottle and structure changes, indicating a layered soil development within the Sourhope site.
  - Block 5 provides broader site context (grid reference NT8544019520, altitude ~315 m, slope ~5°, imperfect drainage; Brown forest soil with gleying; igneous/andesite parent material) to support cross-block comparability and metadata needs.
  - Cross-project data references to ECN and SERAD Micronet networks are present in the broader dataset, supporting long-term monitoring and interoperability.

- Data quality, limitations, and uncertainties:
  - Horizon coding and boundaries are detailed but may require consistent standardization for cross-block comparisons (e.g., horizon naming conventions and color descriptors).
  - Some Na values are missing in Block 4 horizon data, which should be addressed in metadata and data QA/QC.
  - Vegetation data include many coded entries with variable completeness across plots, suggesting potential gaps for full species inventories in some subplots.
  - Baseline snapshot nature for some subplots and horizons; ongoing sampling recommended for robust longitudinal analyses.

- Data storage, provenance, and archiving considerations:
  - Provisional data are linked to MLURI barcodes and horizon-level metadata, enabling traceable field-to-analysis workflows.
  - Archiving recommendations (consistent with the Sourhope data stewardship framework) include preserving raw and processed data separately, linking barcodes to data files, and maintaining provenance across horizons, auger samples, and vegetation records.
  - machine-readable data dictionaries and persistent identifiers are advised to enhance discoverability and cross-site compatibility.

- Access, reuse, and documentation recommendations for Data Stewards:
  - Maintain comprehensive metadata for each horizon, horizon boundaries, sample IDs, grid refs, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, horizon definitions, and sampling dates.
  - Standardize units, variable definitions, and sample IDs across blocks to support cross-plot comparability.
  - Record QA/QC steps and data transformations (e.g., bulked auger sample preparation, treatment dates, exclusions).
  - Provide machine-readable data dictionaries and publish datasets with persistent identifiers; ensure repositories support versioning and traceability from field to analysis.
  - Document horizon nomenclature and indicator species consistently to facilitate cross-site comparisons and integration with ECN SERAD Micronet data streams.

- Key takeaways for Data Stewards:
  - The Block 4 dataset offers a rich, multi-layered resource combining detailed soil profiles, horizon-specific chemistry/physical properties, auger chemistry data, vegetation surveys, and Ecotron components, all indexed by MLURI barcodes.
  - Robust data governance should emphasize metadata completeness, consistent horizon coding, traceable sample IDs, standardized units, and secure, versioned data storage to maximize long-term discoverability and reuse.
  - Given block-level variability and partial data in vegetation records, transparent documentation of limitations and ongoing data collection will be essential for reliable downstream analyses and cross-site syntheses.
