# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Four-year summary of the Sourhope field experiment, focused on above-ground productivity (biomass), plant community composition (diversity), and functional traits under five main elements of site management.
- Three major management processes driving botanical changes:
  - Mowing: year-round mowing to ~6 cm height since 1999 after fencing; promotes Festuca spp. over Agrostis spp.; may encourage bryophyte expansion.
  - Fertilisation: nitrogen and/or lime increases productivity; lime raises soil pH toward ~7.0; possible nutrient- and moisture-related stress after high pH.
  - Insecticide: Dursban 4 applied post-mowing; highest plant diversity observed in insecticide-treated plots (circumstantial evidence for reduced herbivory effects).
- Study aims linked to broader Soil Biodiversity Programme, with emphasis on above-ground responses and links to below-ground processes.

## Data and Site Design (Data-Focused overview)

- Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; outputs allocated to research groups using a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide.
- Data collection and instrumentation:
  - Weather: Automatic Weather Station (on-site) since 1999; headline measures tracked 1999–2002.
  - Vegetation productivity: annual above-ground biomass estimates from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells per plot, dried and weighed after mowing.
  - Baseline and follow-up botanical surveys: 1998 baseline; 2000, 2001, 2002 point analysis surveys using a 100-hole grid for species hits per 0.5 m2 cell.
  - Soil data: soil pH measured at ~5 cm depth; soil moisture measured via theta probe in 2002; periodic bryophyte and vascular plant inventories; supplementary small-scale surveys.
  - Total site samples: 11,621 soil samples collected since start of the experiment.
- Outputs and documentation: extensive appendices detailing site activity, species lists, weather data, biomass by plot, and point-analysis results.

## Key Results

- Above-ground biomass (3.2):
  - 2002 biomass generally lower than 2001, but long-term trend shows rising biomass across all treatments since 1999.
  - Nitrogen and Lime together (N&L) consistently among most productive treatments; Control 2 plots typically less productive than Control 1.
  - Block effects: productivity declined with upslope position; Block 5 showed the largest decline; Block 1 (lower slope) also showed substantial declines.
  - ANOVA indicates significant treatment effects, year effects, and treatment-by-year interactions on biomass.
- pH, moisture, and productivity (3.3):
  - Lime substantially increases soil pH (toward 7) in upper soil layers; nitrogen has a smaller positive effect.
  - Negative correlation between soil moisture and soil pH across treatments.
  - Positive overall relationship between higher soil pH and biomass when all treatments are pooled; within individual treatments, relationships vary (e.g., positive when lime or nitrogen alone; weaker or negative when both nitrogen and lime are applied).
- Point Analysis and species composition (3.4):
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) dominate hits in fertilised plots; unimproved plots dominated by Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum; bryophytes (mosses) increasingly represented across treatments, especially unimproved plots.
  - Bryophyte hits rise over time (1998 baseline to 2002), accounting for a growing share of total hits, particularly in unimproved plots.
  - Litter hits show treatment differences emerging after 2000, with Nitrogen & Lime plots recording the highest litter hits.
  - Shannon diversity index: site-wide increases post-2000, but nitrogen+lime plots show a 2002 decline (~15% below baseline).
  - PCA of 2002 point analysis data separates improved vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster distinctly; nitrogen-treated plots show varied association depending on block.
  - Functional group analysis (CSR framework): three dominant groups—stress tolerant (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR)—dominate 69–95% of hits per plot; by 2002, fertilised plots (especially N&L) show dominance of CSR and SR/CSR; unimproved plots favour S; SR/CSR declines with lime and insecticide treatments.

## Discussion: Interpreting the Data

- Mowing effects (4.1):
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline by >40% since 2000, across all treatments; likely a site-level response to mowing and homogeneous disturbance; Festuca rubra expands in fertile plots.
  - Widespread moss expansion linked to reduced disturbance and mowing height; may be moderated by higher vascular productivity in fertile plots.
- Fertilisation effects (4.2):
  - Long-term productivity gains from N and/or lime; potential productivity peak in highly limed plots due to very high pH; possible moisture competition stress in lime-rich plots.
  - Functional shifts from stress-tolerators toward competitive groups in fertilised plots; nitrogen alone shows weaker CSR shifts than lime; lime appears more influential in driving CSR dynamics.
- Insecticide effects (4.3):
  - Insect herbivory can impact diversity and composition; observed higher Shannon diversity in insecticide plots aligns with Brown & Gange (1989) patterns in some contexts, but causality remains cautious without direct herbivory measurements.
- Trampling effect (4.3/4.4):
  - 2002 C2 plots show reduced productivity possibly due to trampling during 13CO2 pulse experiments; indicates potential confounding effects of trampling on biomass measurements.
- Overall: results indicate strong interactions among mowing, nutrient status, soil chemistry, moisture, and biotic interactions (herbivory, trampling), shaping productivity, species composition, bryophyte abundance, and functional-group structure.

- Data accessibility notes:
  - Comprehensive datasets exist across multiple appendices (Appendix 1–8), including weather, biomass, species lists, point analysis results, and biomass rankings.
  - Historical baseline data (1998) enables longitudinal trend analyses; total site samples exceed 11,000+, reflecting rich data for cross-cut analyses.

## Data Quality, Gaps, and Limitations

- Data gaps and irregularities:
  - 2000–2001 Control 2 plots not surveyed for certain data (logistical gaps noted in appendices).
  - 2002 weather data partial loss due to equipment/software malfunction during July–Nov; where missing, data from a nearby station were substituted.
  - Foot-and-mouth restrictions in 2001 limited site access and certain activities.
- Measurement and interpretation cautions:
  - Insecticide effects are interpreted cautiously due to lack of direct measurements of herbivore pressure; results are correlational with diversity patterns.
  - Trampling and experimental manipulations (e.g., 13CO2 pulses) may confound productivity estimates in certain plots (C2).

## Conclusions and Implications

- Management and environmental factors interact to shape productivity, plant composition, and diversity:
  - Fertilisation reliably boosts above-ground productivity, with nitrogen and lime having the strongest effects when combined.
  - Mowing shifts community composition toward stress-tolerant and moss-dominated states in unimproved conditions, while fertilised plots support more competitive taxa.
  - Insecticide use may support higher plant diversity under infertile conditions, but causality requires further data on insect pressure.
- The dataset provides a robust basis for cross-disciplinary, data-driven products and dashboards to support researchers, policy-makers, and land-management decisions, enabling self-service exploration of treatment effects, temporal trends, and functional group dynamics.
