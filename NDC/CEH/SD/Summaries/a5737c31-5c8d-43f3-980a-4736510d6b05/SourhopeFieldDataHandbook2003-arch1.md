# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5

- A data-rich compilation of soil profiles, laboratory analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys from Sourhope’s Rigg Foot site, focusing on Blocks 4 and 5, with ancillary ECOTRON plot measurements. The material supports analysis of soil-vegetation relationships under defined horizons, texture classes, and mineralogical contexts.

## Block 4: profile description and analyses
- Horizon sequence and depths
  - LF: 0–1 cm
  - FH: 1–4 cm
  - H: 4–8 cm
  - Ah: 8–29 cm
  - Abg: 29–40 cm
  - B sg: 40–61 cm
  - C gx: 61–95 cm
- Soil description highlights
  - Surface horizons: fibrous, moist, abundant fine roots; minimal mineral grains.
  - Ah to Abg: sandy silt loam to coarse sandy silt loam; strong angular/subangular blocky structure; igneous stones present (andesite fragments).
  - Deeper horizons: transition to reddish-brown to pinkish grey colours; bulk density increases; horizon boundaries become sharper.
- Key soil chemistry and physicals (selected values)
  - %N: approximately 0.4–2.14% across horizons (highest in FH/H; lower in deeper horizons).
  - %C: roughly 6–38% (surface horizons high; declines with depth).
  - C:N: 12–20 across horizons (typical for mineral soils with organic-rich surface layers).
  - Ca: 0.36–10.05 meq/100 g (higher in surface horizons; lower with depth; block differences exist).
  - Mg, K, Na: generally low Na; K and Mg variable; Mg often ~3–5 meq/100 g in upper horizons.
  - %Moisture loss and LOI: highest at surface (Moisture loss ~4–11%; LOI up to ~70% in FH/H), decreasing with depth.
  - pH (H2O): ~4.6–4.9 across surface horizons; slightly higher in some deeper horizons.
  - pH (CaCl2): ~3.8–4.1 in surface horizons; generally more acid in CaCl2 extracts.
- Data notes
  - Auger data and horizon samples captured multiple chemical properties including Ca, Mg, K, Na, pH, LOI, %N, %C.
  - Presence of numerous very fine igneous stones across horizons; internal horizon descriptions include well-defined structure types.
- Vegetation and association context (Block 4)
  - Vegetation data show a dominance of grasses with a Four-Community pattern via Twinspan/NVC alignment, and edge vs interior species associations reflecting microhabitat variation.

## Block 5: profile description and analyses
- Horizon sequence and depths
  - LF: 0–1 cm
  - FH: 1–5 cm
  - H: 5–7 cm
  - Ah: 7–25 cm
  - AB: 25–35 cm
  - Bg: 35–49 cm
  - BCg: 49–70 cm
  - Cg: 70–100 cm
- Soil description highlights
  - Similar surface-to-subsoil progression with pronounced mottling (above and within B horizons).
  - AB and Bg horizons show evolving texture (coarse sandy silt loam to clay loam) with abundant fine to medium subangular/angular blocks.
  - Very small igneous stones pervasive; BCg and Cg horizons characterized by massive or weakly structured horizons.
- Key soil chemistry and physicals (selected values)
  - %N: 0.42–2.54% across horizons (peaks in surface Ah/Hf); generally declines with depth.
  - %C: 6–9% in Ah and upper horizons; lower in AB/Bg/Cg horizons.
  - C:N: ~10–16 in deeper horizons, ~12–14 in Ah/AB horizons, indicating substantial organic matter in upper layers.
  - Ca: variability with depth; Ah and AB horizons commonly higher (up to ~11.9 meq/100 g in FH; blocks show localized peaks in some shallow horizons).
  - Mg, K: Mg commonly 1.5–5.9 meq/100 g; K generally low to moderate; Na typically trace.
  - %Moisture loss and LOI: higher in surface horizons (Moisture loss ~4–10%; LOI ~60–75% in Ah); decreases with depth.
  - pH (H2O): ~4.3–5.2 in surface to mid horizons; pH CaCl2 ~3.6–4.5 in upper horizons, with deeper horizons trending slightly less acidic.
- Data notes
  - Auger samples 5A–5F provide a detailed set of chemical properties (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na), moisture loss, LOI, and pH measures, enabling horizon-level comparisons and block contrasts.
  - Block 5 site details situate a brown forest soil with gleying context, with igneous parent material contributing to stone content and texture.

## ECOTRON PLOT and site measurements
- ECOTRON soil analysis (Block 4 ECOTRON plot)
  - Wt: 6.089 mg
  - %N: 0.59
  - %C: 8.22
  - C:N: 13.83
  - Ca: 2.76 meq/100 g; Mg: 1.7 meq/100 g
  - %Moisture loss: 4.79; LOI: 17.42
  - pH H2O: 4.79; pH CaCl2: 3.82
- ECOTRON vegetation survey
  - Plot-level species totals documented; several Plot subplots contributed to species tallies, indicating a diverse, grass-dominated assemblage with indicator and co-occurring species.

## Vegetation survey data (Blocks 4 and 5)
- Block-level summaries indicate species pools ranging from 25+ species (Block 4) to similar or greater richness (Block 5), with main grasses (e.g., Agrostis capillaris, Festuca spp., Nardus stricta) and forbs/shrub indicators distributed across plots.
- Edge vs interior patterns observed; certain indicator species concentrate at plot edges or block boundaries, highlighting microhabitat-driven assemblage differences.
- NVC classifications align with upland grassland communities, with subcommunities and indicator species varying by block and horizon context.

## Data quality, limitations, and interpretation guidance
- Strengths
  - Rich horizon-by-horizon data linking soil chemistry, texture, moisture, LOI, and pH with vegetation data.
  - Block- and plot-level structure allows spatial comparisons and gradient analyses (e.g., depth, moisture, and exchangeable bases).
  - Archiveable samples and metadata facilitate future re-analysis and cross-referencing with other datasets (Twinspan, Association analyses, NVC alignments).
- Limitations
  - Some horizons show missing Na data or uneven sampling across plots/horizons.
  - In Block 4 and Block 5, variation in depth of sampling and presence of stones may affect extrapolation to whole-block conclusions.
  - Vegetation surveys were not exhaustive across all subplots in every plot, so interpretations should treat results as indicative of broader patterns rather than complete inventories for every microplot.
- Practical implications for analysts
  - Use horizon- and block-level data for multivariate analyses (PCA, correlations) linking soil variables (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, pH, LOI, moisture) to vegetation patterns.
  - Consider microtopography, moisture regimes, and stone content when interpreting vegetation–soil relationships.
  - Leverage ECOTRON and plot-level data to explore controlled-environment perturbations versus in-situ grazing/management influences.

## Appendices and data resources (implicit)
- Detailed horizon descriptions, chemical and physical analyses, and site metadata accompany the profiles.
- Graphical and tabular outputs (e.g., extended tables of horizons, auger results, and vegetation tallies) underpin the dataset’s analytical potential.
