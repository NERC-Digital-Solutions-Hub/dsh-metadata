# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large-scale field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for more detailed, group-specific studies; facilitates cross-year and cross-study comparisons.
- Measurements span weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, with data collection protocols designed for linking with other data streams.

## Administration and Context for 2001
- Site management affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May 2001); no visitors allowed, sampling proceeded under controlled protocol.
- Office in charge changed in May 2001; one biocide application was missed during the year.
- Despite disruptions, key management activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued per the 2001 Site Management Plan.

## Data Collection and Methods
- Main site: Sourhope field experiment with baseline established in 1998; year-by-year monitoring to support broader analyses.
- Measurements and timing:
  - Weather: Automatic Weather Station data collected and transmitted; headline measures summarized for 1999–2001.
  - Above-ground biomass: Harvested multiple times in summer (May–Sept) across sub-plots; biomass weights summed and ln-transformed for analyses; results presented as annual totals and year-to-year changes.
  - Soil pH: pH measured at 0–5 cm; lime applications raised pH over time (noted values for limed and N&L plots).
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat (25 plots per plot; 100 cells per frame; 5 g-blocks) conducted in July 2001 to assess species abundance; taxa coded and tracked as hits; data analyzed with PCA and species-biomass correlations.
- Data quality and consistency:
  - Surveyors for the 2001 botanical survey showed no statistically significant difference in results between surveyors.
  - Year-to-year comparisons account for methodological changes (e.g., shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001), with biomasses normalised against the C1 control to identify treatment effects.

## Key Findings by Category

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation and mean temperatures similar to prior years but slightly cooler.
- Soil moisture content slightly higher than in previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments maintained across the sampling period; peak biomass typically in July–August.
- 2001 biomass higher than earlier years, likely due to a combination of staffing changes and the switch to mechanical cutting.
- Normalising by C1 shows persistent positive effects from nitrogen and/or lime, with the highest biomass in the nitrogen plus lime treatment.
- ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L added) vs non-improved plots and a treatment-by-year interaction; no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continued to raise surface pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots ~6.19, N&L plots ~6.38.
- Nitrogen addition alone also raises pH but to a lesser extent; control plots remained close to baseline since 1998.

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- July 2001 survey recorded 58% more hits than July 2000, indicating increased sward density (likely from grazing removal in 1998).
- Dominant species shifted with treatment:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001.
  - Festuca spp. increased across treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide or N&L plots.
  - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) favored Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots remained more associated with less fertile species (e.g., Agrostis vinealis, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
- Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential diversity decline with higher fertility.
- PCA shows clear separation of nutrient/limed plots from control/biocide plots; litter incidence higher in N and/or lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
- Biomass correlations: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis declined as biomass increased.

## Site Heterogeneity
- Spatial variation observed:
  - Columns E and F (sloped, right-hand side) had more acidic plots, biased by a higher proportion of unimproved plots in those columns.
  - Central plots tended to have higher cumulative biomass across years.
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant differences in biomass among blocks, indicating spatial structure influences productivity.

## Data Management and Implications for Data Leaders
- Comprehensive, multi-factor dataset enabling cross-year and cross-treatment analyses, with standardized protocols (e.g., Point Quadrat, biomass harvesting, soil sampling) to support data discoverability and interoperability.
- Data normalization and transformation (e.g., ln-transformed biomass) are essential for robust ANOVA results and year-to-year comparisons, particularly given changes in measurement methods.
- User needs and dissemination: the data are organized to facilitate linkages for various research groups and ease comparisons with baseline and other years, illustrating the value of a coherent data management plan across a long-term field experiment.
- Challenges highlighted for data strategists:
  - Data gaps and access barriers are less about the Sourhope study itself but reflect past external constraints (e.g., FMD-related access restrictions) that can impact data continuity and timeliness.
  - Site heterogeneity requires careful spatial analysis and metadata to ensure correct interpretation of treatment effects.
  - Methodological changes (e.g., cutting equipment) must be documented and accounted for in analysis to avoid confounding results.
- Overall implication: robust data governance, clear metadata, and consistent documentation are crucial to maximize cross-study and cross-year value of long-term data in complex ecological experiments.
