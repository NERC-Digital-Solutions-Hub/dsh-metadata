## Overview
- This document compiles soil analysis and vegetation survey data for Sourhope’s Rigg Foot site, focusing on Block 4 and Block 5 auger samples, as well as ECOTRON plots.
- Emphasizes standardized sampling, data verification, and long-term monitoring to support environmental assessment and policy evaluation.
- Data entries include MLURI barcodes, sample weights, horizon designations, and a wide set of soil chemical and physical parameters.

  - pH(H2O): 4.45–4.82
  - pH(CaCl2): 3.64–4.05
- Observations:
  - Soils are acidic (low pH) with moderate organic matter.
  - Distinct but relatively narrow variation among the six auger samples.

## Block 4 Vegetation Survey (Rigg Foot, Sourhope): Block 4

- Surveys cover PLOT 4A–4F subplots (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Pe, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc).
- Data presentation:
  - Presence/absence and/or counts per subplot, with totals recorded for each plot.
  - Indicates variation in species richness and composition across plots and subplots, enabling comparisons over time and with other blocks.

## Block 5 Soil and Vegetation Data

- Site and profile details (Block 5):
  - Grid reference NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; imperfect drainage.
  - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous/andesite.
  - Soil profile horizons with depths and descriptions (0–100 cm): LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg.
  - Horizon descriptions document fibrous, organic-rich layers (FH, Ah) and increasingly mineral horizons with mottling and gleying (Bg, BCg, Cg).
- Block 5 soil data (auger samples; horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg):
  - %N: ~0.04–2.17
  - %C: ~0.12–33.81
  - C:N Ratio: ~10.20–16.46
  - Ca (meq/100g): ~0.35–11.91
  - Na (meq/100g): generally low/undetectable
  - K (meq/100g): ~0.53–3.3
  - Mg (meq/100g): ~0.58–5.92
  - %Moisture loss: ~2.97–9.43
  - %Loss on Ignition (LOI): ~4.83–67.00
  - pH(H2O): ~3.53–5.20
  - pH(CaCl2): ~3.53–4.14
- Observations:
  - Soils range from strongly organic-rich surface horizons (Ah) to strongly mottled, gleyed mineral horizons (Bg, BCg) with acidic to mildly acidic pH.
  - LOI values are highest in Ah and FH-like horizons, reflecting organic matter content; Ca and Mg show notable surface enrichment.
- Block 5 auger samples (5A–5F):
  - %N: ~0.53–0.62
  - %C: ~7.01–9.07
  - C:N: ~10.20–14.74
  - Ca (meq/100g): ~0.35–5.07
  - Na (meq/100g): ~0.12–0.17
  - K (meq/100g): ~0.53–0.83
  - Mg (meq/100g): ~1.51–2.89
  - %Moisture loss: ~2.97–5.19
  - LOI: ~15.99–20.10
  - pH(H2O): ~4.70–4.95
  - pH(CaCl2): ~3.53–4.14
- Observations:
  - Similar acidity pattern to Block 4, with higher LOI in organic-rich horizons and substantial calcium in more weathered horizons.
  - Horizon-wise variability reflects depth-dependent changes in chemistry and texture.

## ECOTRON PLOT (Rigg Foot, Sourhope)

- Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT 1):
  - Wt: 6.089 mg
  - %N: 0.59
  - %C: 8.22
  - C:N: 13.83
  - Ca: 2.76 meq/100g
  - Na: 0.15 meq/100g
  - K: 0.62 meq/100g
  - Mg: 1.7 meq/100g
  - %Moisture loss: 4.79
  - %Loss on Ignition: 17.42
  - pH(H2O): 4.79
  - pH(CaCl2): 3.82
- Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT):
  - Per-subplot species totals recorded, with a smaller set of species totals indicating lower-density, controlled-environment conditions relative to field plots.

## Data Management and Monitoring Context

- The data are collected and organized to support standardized, high-quality monitoring of soil and vegetation conditions over time.
- Analytical data include comprehensive soil chemistry and basic physical indicators, horizon-level descriptions, and vegetation composition to track ecosystem health, biodiversity, and responses to management or abiotic perturbations.
- The dataset structure (barcodes, horizon designations, and replicates) supports longitudinal analyses and cross-site comparisons within the Sourhope ECN/Micronet framework.
