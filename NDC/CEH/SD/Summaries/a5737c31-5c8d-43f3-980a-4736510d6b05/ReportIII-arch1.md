# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on intensive study of a large field experiment at Sourhope Farm, Macaulay Institute, Scotland.
- A Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998) described site, rationale, experimental design, methods, and management; initial broad monitoring was set to provide context for detailed studies.
- Measurements were scheduled to enable cross-project comparisons and year-to-year links; data collection included multiple plots, treatments, and monitoring activities.
- 2001 site management affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May; no visitors; protocols for sampling resumed afterward) and a change in the site Manager (May 2001).

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall near the long-term annual average; total rainfall comparable to prior years.
- Radiation levels showed little change; average temperatures slightly lower.
- Average soil moisture content higher than in previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Clear, consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments throughout the sampling period.
- Peak biomass consistently in July or August each year.
- 2001 biomass estimates increased markedly compared with previous years, likely due to:
  - Change in personnel.
  - Switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Biomass analyses normalized to C1 (control) to assess treatment effects:
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime additions produced the strongest positive effect on biomass.
  - ANOVA: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continued to raise soil pH in the top 5 cm.
- October 2001 mean pH:
  - Limed plots: 6.19
  - Nitrogen + Lime (N&L) plots: 6.38
  - Nitrogen-alone plots: raised pH but to a lesser extent
  - Control plots: no significant change since baseline (Aug 1998)

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis protocol mirrored 2000; no significant difference between surveyors in 2001.
- Total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000, suggesting increased sward density, possibly due to the removal of grazing stock in 1998.
- Treatment differences in the most frequently encountered species:
  - Agrostis capillaris (dominant in 2000) declined across all treatments in 2001; remained most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (F. ovina and F. rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen and Biocide (F. ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (F. rubra) plots.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more prevalent in fertilized plots (especially those with both Nitrogen and Lime).
  - Species typical of less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in untreated Control plots.
- Diversity:
  - 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting possible early diversity decline in the most improved plots.
- Multivariate analyses:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control and biocide plots.
  - Improved plots associated with higher frequencies of Festuca rubra and related species; unimproved plots linked with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Biomass correlation:
  - Increased above-ground biomass correlated with higher relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Decline in relative abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes as biomass increased.
  - Greater litter frequency observed in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope side) contained more acidic plots.
- This spatial trend may be exaggerated by a higher proportion of Control or Biocide plots in those columns.
- Underlying heterogeneity suggested by comparatively low pH in some Nitrogen and/or Lime plots in these columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass distribution showed outlier plots with lower biomass across treatments, while central-location plots tended to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks (statistical note: ANOVA results reported; no block effect detected).
