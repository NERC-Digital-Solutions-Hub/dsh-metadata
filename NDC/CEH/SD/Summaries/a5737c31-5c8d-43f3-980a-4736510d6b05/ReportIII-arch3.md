# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- An intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, designed to provide a broad monitoring context for linked studies and enable year-to-year comparisons across treatments.

- Aimed to identify and contextualise environmental health measures to inform policy scrutiny and future decisions.

- Presents 1999–2001 results with emphasis on links between treatments, biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community composition, plus site heterogeneity and management context.

## Monitoring scope and data management

- Monitoring categories include:
  - Automatic Weather Station data (site meteorology and soil moisture)
  - Above-ground biomass production across treatments
  - Soil pH in the upper 5 cm
  - Botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys
  - Additional context from related studies (minirhizotron work and disturbance/nutrient matrices)

- Experimental design:
  - Plots under six treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide
  - Split-plot design across blocks; annual activities from 1999–2001 with five mowing occasions per summer
  - Biomass data were ln-transformed for ANOVA; results normalised to a reference plot (C1) to compare treatment effects over time
  - Multivariate analyses included Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of botanical data

- Data collection and integrity:
  - Routine site management and data collection occurred, with a noted shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001
  - In 2001, access restrictions occurred due to Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) which affected sampling tempo; sampling proceeded under agreed protocols
  - Acknowledges changes in site management and staff as potential influences on measurements

## Key results by topic

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to prior years
  - Average temperatures slightly lower; higher soil moisture in 2001 relative to earlier years

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Consistent treatment hierarchy in biomass; peaks in July/August
  - 2001 biomass higher than 2000 across treatments, likely due to staff changes and switch to mechanical cutting
  - Normalising to C1 showed nitrogen and/or lime treatments most effective for biomass; nitrogen-plus-lime had strong positive impact
  - ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block differences

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Lime additions raised surface pH (0–5 cm) to about 6.19 (limed plots) and 6.38 (N&L plots) by Oct 2001
  - Nitrogen addition alone also increased pH, but less than lime; control plots unchanged since baseline (Aug 1998)

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - July 2001 point quadrat survey replicated; high consistency between surveyors
  - 58% more hits in 2001 vs 2000, suggesting higher sward density (likely aided by prior grazing removal in 1998)
  - Clear treatment differences in dominant species:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001
    - Festuca rubra and Festuca spp. increased across treatments, especially in fertilised plots
    - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed a shift toward grasses associated with improved pastures (Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis)
  - Species richness: unimproved plots had 24 species; improved plots had 18, suggesting potential biodiversity decline with fertility enhancement
  - PCA separated improved vs unimproved plots; unimproved plots associated with species like Agrostis vinealis, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum
  - Biomass correlations:
    - Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass
    - Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass increased
  - Litter incidence increased with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster turnover with higher fertility

## Site heterogeneity

- 3.1 Spatial variation in surface pH and plant community
  - 2000 report noted more acidic plots in columns E/F (slope-facing right side)
  - In 2001, some columns still showed slight underlying spatial heterogeneity, with lower pH in nitrogen and/or lime plots in those columns

- 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
  - Outliers exhibited lower biomass across treatments; central plots generally showed higher biomass
  - Positive correlation observed between surface soil pH and biomass
  - No significant differences between blocks for biomass, indicating limited block-level heterogeneity in this year

## Implications for monitoring and governance

- Demonstrates how integrated, multi-metric monitoring (weather, soil chemistry, biomass, and plant community surveys) supports interpretation of treatment effects and year-to-year trends.
- Highlights data-quality considerations:
  - Importance of consistent methodology (e.g., mowing technique) to ensure comparability
  - Value of normalising against a baseline treatment to identify true treatment effects
  - Need to account for site heterogeneity in analysis and reporting
- External factors affecting monitoring:
  - FMD-related access restrictions and staff changes can influence sampling consistency and results
- Findings support policy-relevant insights on:
  - The efficacy of liming and nitrogen fertilisation for biomass production and soil chemistry
  - The ecological implications of fertility and lime additions on plant community composition and biodiversity
  - The relationship between soil pH, biomass, and species composition across managed grassland plots
