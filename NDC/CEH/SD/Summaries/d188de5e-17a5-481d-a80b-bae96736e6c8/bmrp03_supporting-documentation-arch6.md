# Sampling regime and collection methods

- Study context and population
  - Wild banded mongooses (Mungos mungo) on the Mweya Peninsula, Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda.
  - Long-running project since 1995; groups typically 10–12, about 20 adults plus offspring per group.
  - Individuals are uniquely marked (fur patches in adults; dye marks in pups); regular trapping every 2 months for identification maintenance.
  - Approximately two radio-collared individuals per group to aid location; most groups habituated to observers at close range.

- Experimental design
  - Five focal groups subjected to simulated intrusions (March 2016–May 2017) to mimic intergroup conflict.
  - Stimuli included: rival feces/urine/scent marks (olfactory), rival war cry playback (auditory), and rival adult males in traps (visual).
  - Stimuli sourced from the neighboring rival group; same rival used for all trials within a focal group.
  - Control trials used stimuli from the focal group itself (with focal-group feces/scent marks; “close call” vocalizations instead of war cries; and temporary removal of focal-group males).
  - Total: 22 simulated intrusion trials and 22 control trials; trials spaced at least two weeks apart to minimize habituation.
  - Data collected per trial: social interactions in the focal group over a 5-day window (2 days before, day of, 2 days after presentation).

- Observation and data collection protocol
  - Daily timing: observations conducted 07:00–12:00 and 16:00–19:30; at le
