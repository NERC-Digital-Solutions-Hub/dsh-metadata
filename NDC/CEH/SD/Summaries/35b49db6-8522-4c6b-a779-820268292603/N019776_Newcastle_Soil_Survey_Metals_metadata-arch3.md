# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Purpose and scope
- Study collates relative abundance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in DNA extracted from soils around Newcastle upon Tyne.
- Simultaneously measures concentrations of PAHs and metals.
- Sampling design covers four treatments by land-use and metal exposure: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.

## Fieldwork
- Conducted in June 2016.
- Soil sampled from the upper horizon (<15 cm) and refrigerated until processing.
- Sampling locations preselected based on prior metal concentration data and land-use.

## Analytical methods
- Soil pH measured per ISO 10390:2005 using a 1:5 soil-to-deionised water slurry; pH meter used for readings.
- Metal concentrations determined by ICP-MS at Northumbria Water Scientific Services; total metals via aqua regia digestion.
- Bioavailable metals assessed with modified BCR sequential extraction:
  - Step 1: 0.11 M acetic acid extraction (40 mL acetic acid + 1 g soil) for 16 h, followed by centrifugation.
  - Step 2: Residual solids subjected to 0.5 M hydroxylammonium chloride at pH 1.5 for 16 h, centrifuged; extracts kept for ICP-MS.
- Results: total metals in mg/kg; bioavailable metals reported in ppm.

## Data structure and units
- Main dataset columns:
  - Rural/Urban (land-use category)
  - Location (common name)
  - Latitude, Longitude (geographic coordinates)
  - pH (soil pH value)
  - Metals/Elements: Al, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Hg, Ni, P, Zn
  - Results split into:
    - Total metals (aqua regia extractions) — columns F-Q
    - Bioavailable metals (Step 1 BCR) — columns R-AD
    - Bioavailable metals (Step 2 BCR) — columns AE-AQ

## Nature of recorded units
- Total metals: mg/kg
- Bioavailable metals: ppm

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks (for authors and policymakers)
- Demonstrates a structured, transparent approach to environmental health monitoring design:
  - Predefined sampling strategy tied to prior data and land-use context.
  - Use of standardized, validated analytical methods enabling comparability.
  - Distinct metrics (total vs. bioavailable metals) to inform risk assessment and policy decisions.
  - Geolocated data with clear data fields and units suitable for dashboards, reports, or governance processes.
- Highlights data quality considerations:
  - Need for metadata, data sharing, and data governance to ensure datasets are usable and up-to-date.
  - Metadata completeness and standardization facilitate independent verification and cross-site comparisons.
- Supports decision-making needs:
  - Provides a replicable framework for monitoring environmental contaminants alongside AMR indicators.
  - Data outputs can inform interventions, risk communication, and long-term tracking of soil health and antimicrobial resistance indicators.
