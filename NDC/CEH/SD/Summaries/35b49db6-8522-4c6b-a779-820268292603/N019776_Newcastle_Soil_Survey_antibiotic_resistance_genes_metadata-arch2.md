# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

- Overview
  - A dataset describing the relative abundance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in soils around Newcastle upon Tyne, NE England.
  - Field sites preselected based on previous metal concentration data and land-use, representing four treatments: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
  - Samples collected in June 2016 from the upper soil horizon (<15 cm) and kept refrigerated until processing.

- Fieldwork
  - Soil samples gathered from sites chosen to reflect different metal exposures and urban/rural contexts.
  - Four treatment combinations used to compare AMR gene abundance across environmental settings.
  - Handling: samples collected in the field and maintained under conditions suitable for downstream DNA analysis.

- Analytical methods
  - DNA extraction performed on soil samples using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil.
  - Extracted DNA stored at -80°C until analysis.
  - For high-throughput AMR gene analysis, 500–2000 ng of DNA were freeze-dried and shipped to the Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Xiamen, China).
  - Quantitative PCR conducted with the Applied Biosystems OpenArray platform, using primers and methods from prior work.
  - Detection threshold set at a threshold cycle (Ct) of 37.

- Nature of recorded units
  - AMR genes reported as relative abundances calculated via the delta-delta Ct method.
  - 16S rRNA levels quantified to provide a surrogate measure of total bacterial abundance.

- Details of data structure
  - Main rows are organized around Table 1, which lists high-throughput qPCR assays and their ARDB (Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database) nomenclature.
  - Data fields include: 16S rRNA, ARDB gene, and Antibiotic Classification, with extensive mappings for numerous AMR genes (e.g., aminoglycoside, beta-lactamase, MLSB, tetracycline resistance, etc.).
  - The dataset captures both gene identifiers and their corresponding antibiotic classes, illustrating the breadth of AMR gene representation assayed in the study.
