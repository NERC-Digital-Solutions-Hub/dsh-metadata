# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

- Purpose: Collation of the relative abundance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes detected in DNA extracted from soils around Newcastle upon Tyne, facilitating understanding of AMR gene distribution in relation to metal concentrations and land use.
- Fieldwork design: Locations preselected based on prior sampling of metals and land-use, representing four treatments—low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
- Sampling timing and depth: Collected in June 2016 from the upper soil horizon (less than 15 cm); samples refrigerated until processing.
- DNA handling: Community DNA extracted with FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil; stored at -80°C; 500–2000 ng of DNA used for high-throughput analysis; DNA also freeze-dried for processing.
- Analytical approach: High-throughput qPCR performed using the OpenArray platform with primers designed from established studies (e.g., Zhu et al. 2013, 2017; Looft et al. 2012); detection threshold set at Ct = 37.
- Data units: Relative abundances of AMR genes calculated via the delta-delta Ct method; 16S rRNA quantified to provide a proxy for total bacterial abundance.
- Data structure: Main dataset rows are organized around Table 1, listing AMR genes with ARDB (Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database) identifiers and corresponding antibiotic classifications; extensive mapping between ARDB genes, ARDB IDs, and antibiotic classes is provided.
- Documentation and references: Includes the standard references for methods and databases used (Livak & Schmittgen 2001; Liu & Pop 2009; Looft et al. 2012; Rothwell & Cooke 2015; Zhu et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2017).
- Governance and stewardship implications for data stewards:
  - Metadata and interoperability: Ensure consistent gene naming, ARDB IDs, and antibiotic classifications to support cross-dataset discovery and reuse.
  - Provenance: Document sample origins, processing steps, and analytical platforms to support traceability.
  - Update and maintenance: Consider versioning of ARDB mappings and taxonomies, given potential updates to AMR gene databases.
  - Accessibility: Data are structured for machine readability via the ARDB mapping table; ensure availability through appropriate data portals and catalogs.
