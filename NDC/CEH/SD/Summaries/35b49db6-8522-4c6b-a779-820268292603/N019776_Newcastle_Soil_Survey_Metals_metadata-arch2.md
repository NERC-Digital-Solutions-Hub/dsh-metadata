# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Overview
- A study compiling the relative abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes in DNA extracted from soils around Newcastle upon Tyne, alongside measurements relevant to PAHs and metals.
- Sampling design covers four land-use/metal concentration categories to explore environmental health gradients: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
- Fieldwork and laboratory analyses conducted on samples collected in June 2016 from the upper soil horizon (<15 cm).

## Field sampling design
- Sample locations preselected based on prior metal concentration data and land-use information (Rothwell and Cooke, 2015).
- Four treatment groups: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
- Samples collected from the upper soil horizon (<15 cm) and refrigerated until processing.

## Analytical methods

### Soil pH
- Measured following ISO 10390:2005.
- Procedure: soil suspended at a 1:5 volume-to-volume ratio in deionised water, shaken for 1 hour, equilibrated overnight, then measured with a pH meter.

### Metal concentrations
- Total metals and bioavailable fractions analyzed by ICP-MS at Northumbria Water Scientific Services.
- Total metals: aqua regia digestion (1 g soil in 1:3 ratio of nitric to hydrochloric acid).
- Bioavailable metals:
  - Step 1 (BCR): extraction with 0.11 M acetic acid, 40 mL acid with 1 g soil, 16 hours at room temperature, centrifuged; liquid extracts analyzed by ICP-MS.
  - Step 2 (BCR): residual solids from Step 1 extracted with 0.5 M hydroxylammonium chloride at pH 1.5, 16 hours at room temperature; liquid extracts analyzed by ICP-MS.
- Extracts stored at 4°C prior to analysis.

### Data units
- Total metals: mg/kg.
- Bioavailable metals: ppm (mg/kg equivalent).

## Data structure and organization
- Main dataset columns include:
  - Rural/Urban (land-use category)
  - Location (common name)
  - Latitude and Longitude
  - pH
  - Metals/elements: Al, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Hg, Ni, P, Zn
- Results are organized into three groups:
  - Total metals (aqua regia extrations) — columns F-Q
  - Bioavailable metals (Step 1 BCR extractions) — columns R-AD
  - Bioavailable metals (Step 2 BCR extractions) — columns AE-AQ

## Data quality and standards (context)
- Field and lab methods adhere to established standards and protocols to enable comparability and reproducibility across monitoring efforts.
- Use of recognized extraction procedures (BCR) and ISO standard for pH ensures alignment with environmental monitoring best practices.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring aims
- Demonstrates a standardized approach to collecting and analyzing environmental data to assess soil health across different land uses and contamination levels.
- Facilitates integration of datasets into monitoring portals and supports scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
