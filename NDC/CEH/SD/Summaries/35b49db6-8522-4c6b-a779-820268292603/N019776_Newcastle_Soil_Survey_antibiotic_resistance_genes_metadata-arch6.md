# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Fieldwork
- Sample locations around Newcastle upon Tyne were preselected based on prior metal concentration data and land-use.
- Four treatment groups: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
- Sampling occurred in June 2016 from the upper soil horizon (less than 15 cm depth).
- Samples were refrigerated after collection for later processing.

## Analytical methods
- Community DNA extracted from soils using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil; DNA stored at -80°C.
- High-throughput analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes conducted by sending 500–2000 ng of DNA (freeze-dried) to the Institute of Urban Environment, CAS, Xiamen, China.
- Quantitative PCR performed on the Applied Biosystems OpenArray platform using established primers.
- Detection limit set at a threshold cycle (CT) of 37.

## Nature of recorded units
- AMR gene data are expressed as relative gene abundances, calculated using the delta-delta CT method.
- 16S rRNA levels quantified to provide a surrogate measure of total bacterial abundance.

## Data structure
- Main rows are organized according to Table 1: High-throughput qPCR assays and their ARDB (Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database) nomenclature.
- Data pairs include: 16S rRNA, ARDB gene, and corresponding antibiotic classification.
- The ARDB gene table maps numerous gene names to ARDB codes and antibiotic classifications (e.g., aminoglycosides, beta-lactamases, MLSB, tetracycline resistance, etc.), with many entries showing multiple aliases and classifications.
- The table demonstrates a comprehensive linking of each AMR target to a standardized ARDB code and its antibiotic category for downstream analyses.

## Data contents and references
- The dataset comprises an extensive AMR gene target panel with accompanying ARDB mappings and antibiotic classifications, suitable for aggregating by gene, mechanism, or antibiotic class.
- 5 references underpin the methods and context, including delta-delta CT analysis, ARDB resource, prior AMR studies, and urban soil metal-background methodologies.
