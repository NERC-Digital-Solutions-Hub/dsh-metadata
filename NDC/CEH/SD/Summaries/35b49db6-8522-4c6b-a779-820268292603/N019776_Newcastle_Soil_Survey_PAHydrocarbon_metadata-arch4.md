# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Overview
- Describes a soil study in the Newcastle upon Tyne area focusing on antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals.
- Samples were collected from soils around Newcastle upon Tyne to assess relative abundance of ARGs in DNA extracted from soils.
- Study design includes four land-use/metal concentration combinations: low-metal rural, low-metal urban, high-metal rural, high-metal urban.
- Fieldwork conducted in June 2016; samples from the upper soil horizon (<15 cm) and stored refrigerated for processing.

## Field collection design
- Locations preselected based on prior metal concentration data and land-use, to represent different treatment groups.
- Four treatment categories: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
- Sampling focused on upper soil layer to capture contemporary conditions relevant to PAH/metal exposure and ARGs.

## Analytical methods
- Soil moisture: measured in triplicate by drying in porcelain crucibles at 105 °C; moisture expressed as a percentage of dry mass.
- Total organic carbon (TOC): quantified in triplicate with a LECO CS244 analyzer (infrared detection) and reported as % of dry weight.
- Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN): determined following standard APHA methods.
- Soil pH: measured on a 1:5 soil-to-deionised water slurry after equilibration; pH meter used.
- PAH analysis: conducted by Northumbrian Water Scientific Services using Soxhlet extraction followed by GC-MS.
- Units: PAHs reported in parts-per-million (mg/kg soil); TOC and TKN as % of dry soil weight.

## Nature of recorded units
- PAHs: EPA 16 Priority PAH compounds listed (naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene).
- TOC: percentage of dry soil weight.
- TKN: percentage of dry soil weight (sum of ammonia/ammonium and organic nitrogen).

## Details of data structure (columns)
- Rural/Urban: land-use category (A).
- Location: common name of location (B).
- Latitude: geographic latitude (C).
- Longitude: geographic longitude (D).
- pH: soil pH value (E).
- Total Organic Carbon: TOC as % dry weight (F).
- Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen: TKN as % dry weight (G).
- EPA 16 Priority PAH: individual PAH concentrations (H–W).
- Total PAH: sum of the EPA 16 Priority PAHs (column totals from H–W).

## Data quality, provenance, and notes
- Uses established field and analytical protocols (e.g., ISO 10390:2005 for pH; APHA Standard Methods for TKN) to ensure comparability.
- PAH analysis performed by a specialized analytical service, indicating external quality control for that portion.
- Data structure includes explicit metadata-like columns to support discoverability, traceability, and reuse (location, coordinates, land-use, and key chemical measurements).
- The dataset’s design emphasizes evaluation across environmental contexts (rural/urban and varying metal levels) to understand how these factors influence ARGs, PAHs, and soil chemistry.
