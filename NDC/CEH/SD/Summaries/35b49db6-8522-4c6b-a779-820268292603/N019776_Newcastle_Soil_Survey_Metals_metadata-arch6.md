# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Fieldwork

- Preselected sample locations based on prior metal concentrations and land-use (four treatments: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban).
- Samples collected in June 2016 from the upper soil horizon (less than 15 cm from surface).
- Samples were refrigerated after collection and processed subsequently.

## Analytical methods

- Soil pH measured following ISO 10390:2005 on slurries prepared at a 1:5 soil-to-water ratio.
- Total metal concentrations determined by ICP-MS; aqua regia digestion used for total metals.
- Bioavailable metal concentrations determined using a two-step modified BCR sequential extraction:
  - Step 1: acetic acid extraction (0.11 M) for 16 hours, 40 mL acid with 1 g soil.
  - Step 2: extraction of solid residues with 40 mL of 0.5 M hydroxylammonium chloride at pH 1.5 for 16 hours.
- Extracts from Step 1 and Step 2 analyzed by ICP-MS; all extracts stored at 4°C prior to analysis.

## Nature of recorded units

- Total metal concentrations: mg/kg.
- Bioavailable metal concentrations: ppm (mg/kg equivalent).

## Data structure

- Main data columns include:
  - Rural/Urban (land-use category)
  - Location (common name)
  - Latitude and Longitude (coordinates)
  - pH (soil pH value)
  - Metals and elements analyzed: Al, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Hg, Ni, P, Zn
- Results are organized into three data blocks:
  - 1) Total metals (aqua regia extractions) – corresponding columns F through Q
  - 2) Bioavailable metals (Step 1 BCR extractions) – columns R through AD
  - 3) Bioavailable metals (Step 2 BCR extractions) – columns AE through AQ
