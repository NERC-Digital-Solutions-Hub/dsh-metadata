# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Overview
- A field study compiling the relative abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes in DNA extracted from soils around Newcastle upon Tyne, alongside concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals.
- Sampling locations were preselected by prior metal concentration data and land-use, forming four treatments: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, and high-metal/urban.
- Samples collected in June 2016 from the upper soil horizon (<15 cm) and kept refrigerated for processing.
- Data are intended to be produced into standardized outputs (e.g., reports, maps, charts) and stored in appropriate data portals.

## Field sampling design
- Preselected locations based on previous metal concentration data and land-use classification.
- Four treatment groups combining metal exposure level (low/high) and land-use (rural/urban).
- Soil sampled from the upper horizon and collected in June 2016; samples kept refrigerated.

## Analytical methods
- Soil moisture: measured in triplicate, dried at 105 °C; expressed as percentage of dry weight.
- Total Organic Carbon (TOC): measured in triplicate using LECO CS244; reported as % of dry weight.
- Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN): quantified by standard APHA 2010 methods.
- Soil pH: determined on a 1:5 soil:water slurry (vol:vol) using ISO 10390:2005; measured with a pH meter after equilibration.
- PAH analysis: performed by Northumbrian Water Scientific Services using Soxhlet extraction followed by GC-MS.

## Units
- PAHs: parts per million (ppm) or mg/kg of soil.
- TOC: percent (% by dry weight).
- TKN: percent (% by dry weight).

## Data structure (main columns)
- Rural/Urban: land-use context of the sampling location (A).
- Location: common name of the site (B).
- Latitude: geographic latitude (C).
- Longitude: geographic longitude (D).
- pH: soil pH value (E).
- Total Organic Carbon: TOC (% dry weight) (F).
- Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen: TKN (% dry weight) (G).
- EPA 16 Priority PAH: individual PAH compounds (naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene) (columns H–W).
- Total PAH: sum of the EPA 16 Priority PAHs (as measured).

## Data quality and stewardship
- Data generated using standard, widely accepted methods with triplicate analyses to ensure reliability.
- Outputs are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for accessibility and reuse.
