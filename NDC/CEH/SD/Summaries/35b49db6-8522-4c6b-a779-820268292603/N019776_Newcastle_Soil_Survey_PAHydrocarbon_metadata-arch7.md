# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Fieldwork
- Aims to collate the relative abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes found in DNA extracted from soils surrounding areas of Newcastle upon Tyne.
- Sample locations preselected based on metal concentrations identified in previous sampling (Rothwell & Cooke, 2015) and land-use, representing four treatments: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, and high-metal/urban.
- Samples collected in June 2016.
- Depth: upper horizon (<15 cm from the surface).
- Handling: samples refrigerated until processing.

## Analytical methods
- Soil moisture: determined in triplicate in porcelain crucibles dried to constant mass at 105 °C; moisture content expressed as a percentage of dry mass.
- Total organic carbon (TOC): analyzed in triplicate using a LECO CS244 carbon analyser; reported as % of total dry weight.
- Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN): quantified according to standard methods (APHA, 2010).
- Soil pH: determined on soils suspended at a 1:5 vol:vol ratio in deionised water (ISO 10390:2005); slurry mixed for 1 h, left overnight, measured with a Jenway 3020 pH meter.
- PAH analyses: conducted by Northumbrian Water Scientific Services using Soxhlet extraction followed by GC-MS detection.

## Nature of recorded units
- PAHs: expressed as parts-per-million (ppm) or mg/kg of soil.
- TOC and TKN: expressed as percentage of dry-weight of the soils.

## Data structure
- Rural/Urban: land-use category of the sample location (A).
- Location: common (layman’s) name of the location (B).
- Latitude: geographic latitude (C).
- Longitude: geographic longitude (D).
- pH: soil pH value (E).
- Total organic carbon (%): TOC as a weight percentage of dried soils (F).
- Total Kjeldahl (%): TKN as a weight percentage of dried soils (G).
- EPA 16 Priority PAH: individual compounds (naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene) (columns H-W).
- Total PAH: sum of the EPA 16 Priority PAHs.
