# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Overview
- Describes field sampling and analytical methods for soil in NE England (around Newcastle upon Tyne) focusing on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metals.
- Sampling design aims to relate AMR gene abundance with soil contaminants and land-use contexts.

## Fieldwork design
- Location: soils surrounding Newcastle upon Tyne, NE England.
- Sampling basis: locations preselected based on metal concentrations from prior sampling and land-use.
- Treatments represented: four groups – low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
- Timing: June 2016.
- Depth: upper horizon, less than 15 cm from the surface.
- Sample handling: samples refrigerated until processing.

## Analytical methods
- Soil moisture: measured in triplicate after drying to constant mass at 105 °C; reported on a dry-mass basis.
- Total Organic Carbon (TOC): measured in triplicate with a LECO CS244 carbon analyser; reported as a percentage of dry soil weight.
- Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN): quantified using standard APHA (2010) methods.
- Soil pH: determined (ISO 10390:2005) in a soil-water slurry (1:5 v/v), equilibrated overnight, measured with a pH meter.
- PAHs: analyzed by Northumbrian Water Scientific Services using Soxhlet extraction followed by GC-MS.

## Data units and structure
- Units:
  - PAHs: parts per million (ppm) or mg/kg of soil.
  - TOC and TKN: percentage of dry-weight soil.
- Main dataset columns:
  - Rural/Urban classification (A)
  - Location name (B)
  - Latitude (C)
  - Longitude (D)
  - pH (E)
  - TOC (%) (F)
  - TKN (%) (G)
  - EPA 16 Priority PAHs (H–W)
  - Total PAH (sum of EPA 16) (subsequent column)
- Data provenance and standards:
  - PAH analysis and general soil testing aligned with APHA (2010) and ISO 10390:2005 standards.
  - References include Rothwell & Cooke (2015) for background element concentration context.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates end-to-end workflow for environmental health monitoring: field sampling design linked to laboratory analyses, producing standardized measures (pH, TOC, TKN, PAHs) alongside AMR gene considerations.
- Provides a concrete example of assembling metadata (location, land-use, coordinates) with lab-derived data to inform policy evaluation and decision-making.
- Highlights data governance considerations relevant to monitoring frameworks (metadata completeness, data sharing, QA/QC, and harmonization across datasets).

## Considerations for policy-focused monitoring
- Data quality and completeness: triplicate measurements for key soil properties improve reliability; clear documentation of sampling decisions (e.g., preselection by metal concentration) aids interpretation.
- Data accessibility and interoperability: alignment to standard methods facilitates data sharing, comparison, and integration with other monitoring datasets.
- Communicating results: aggregation (e.g., Total PAH) aids clarity but should be complemented with detailed constituent data for policy scrutiny.
- Data governance: underscores the need for metadata, provenance, and transparent data management to overcome potential silos and ensure up-to-date, verifiable datasets.
