# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

- Scope and field design
  - Study area: soils surrounding Newcastle upon Tyne, NE England
  - Focus: relative abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in DNA extracted from soils and associated metal concentrations
  - Sampling design: preselected locations based on prior metal concentration data and land-use, representing four treatments
    - Low-metal/rural
    - Low-metal/urban
    - High-metal/rural
    - High-metal/urban
  - Sampling time and depth: June 2016, upper horizon (<15 cm from surface)
  - Sample handling: samples refrigerated until processing

- Analytical methods
  - Soil pH
    - Method: ISO 10390:2005
    - Procedure: suspension 1:5 in deionised water, shaken for 1 h, equilibrated overnight, measured with a pH meter
  - Metal concentration determinations
    - Total metals: aqua regia digestion, analyzed by ICP-MS
    - Bioavailable metals
      - Step 1: Extraction with 0.11 M acetic acid (40 mL) + 1 g soil for 16 h; centrifuge and ICP-MS analysis
      - Step 2: Residual solids treated with 0.5 M hydroxylammonium chloride (pH 1.5) for 16 h; centrifuge and ICP-MS analysis
  - Units
    - Total metals: mg/kg
    - Bioavailable metals (Step 1 and Step 2): ppm (mg/kg effectively)

- Data structure and variables
  - Key metadata
    - Rural/Urban land-use category
    - Location (common name)
    - Latitude and Longitude
    - pH value
  - Metals analyzed
    - Aluminium (Al), Arsenic (As), Beryllium (Be), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Lead (Pb), Mercury (Hg), Nickel (Ni), Phosphorus (P), Zinc (Zn)
  - Data groupings (results)
    - Total metals: columns F–Q
    - Bioavailable metals (Step 1): columns R–AD
    - Bioavailable metals (Step 2): columns AE–AQ

- Interpretive context and potential use
  - Enables analysis of relationships between land-use, soil chemistry (pH), total and bioavailable metal concentrations, and the abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes
  - Supports cross-dataset integration and potential statistical modeling to identify correlations and predictors
  - Provides geographically explicit data (latitude/longitude) suitable for spatial analyses and mapping
