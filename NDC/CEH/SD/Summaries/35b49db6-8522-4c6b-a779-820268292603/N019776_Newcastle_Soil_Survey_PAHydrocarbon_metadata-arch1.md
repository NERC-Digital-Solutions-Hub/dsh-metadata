# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Overview
- Study collates data on antimicrobial resistance gene abundance in DNA extracted from soils around Newcastle upon Tyne, alongside concentrations of PAHs and metals.
- Sampling design preselected by metal concentrations and land-use to form four treatments: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
- Fieldwork conducted in June 2016, sampling the upper soil horizon (less than 15 cm) and samples were refrigerated after collection.

## Fieldwork design
- Location factors: urban vs rural and low vs high metal concentrations.
- Depth: upper horizon (<15 cm) collected for analysis.
- Sample handling: samples refrigerated until processing.

## Analytical methods
- Soil moisture: measured in triplicate; dried at 105 °C; expressed as a percentage of dry mass.
- Total Organic Carbon (TOC): measured in triplicate using a LECO CS244 carbon analyzer; reported as % of dry soil weight.
- Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN): quantified by standard APHA methods (2010); expressed as % of dry soil weight.
- Soil pH: determined on a 1:5 soil-to-water slurry (vol/vol); equilibrated overnight; measured with a pH meter (Jenway 3020).
- Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH): analyzed by Northumbrian Water Scientific Services via Soxhlet extraction followed by GC-MS.

## Recorded units
- PAHs: parts per million (ppm) or mg/kg of soil.
- TOC: % by dry weight.
- TKN: % by dry weight.

## Data structure (main dataset columns)
- Rural/Urban: land-use category (A)
- Location: common site name (B)
- Latitude: geographic latitude (C)
- Longitude: geographic longitude (D)
- pH: soil pH value (E)
- Total Organic Carbon (TOC): % weight of dried soils (F)
- Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN): % weight of dried soils (G)
- EPA 16 Priority PAH: individual compounds (H–W)
- Total PAH: sum of EPA 16 PAHs (as measured)
