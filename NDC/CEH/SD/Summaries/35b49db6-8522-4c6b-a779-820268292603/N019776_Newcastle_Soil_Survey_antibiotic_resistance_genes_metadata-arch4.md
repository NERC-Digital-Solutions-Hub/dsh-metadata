# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Context and study design
- Fieldwork conducted on soils around Newcastle upon Tyne, NE England.
- Sampling locations preselected based on metal concentrations and land-use to represent four treatments: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
- Samples collected in June 2016 from the upper soil horizon (<15 cm) and refrigerated until processing.

## Methods and analytical approach
- DNA extraction from soils using the FastDNA Spin Kit for soils; DNA stored at -80°C.
- 500–2000 ng of DNA freeze-dried and sent for high-throughput analysis at the Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Xiamen, China).
- Quantitative PCR conducted on the OpenArray platform using primers/methods from prior work (e.g., Zhu 2013, 2017; Looft 2012); Ct detection limit set at 37.
- Antibiotic resistance gene abundances calculated as relative abundances using the delta-delta Ct method; 16S rRNA levels quantified to provide a surrogate for total bacterial abundance.

## Data structure and content
- Primary rows are organized around a table of high-throughput qPCR assays; nomenclature aligns with the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB).
- Data include: 16S rRNA measurements, ARDB gene identifiers, and corresponding antibiotic classifications (e.g., aminoglycosides, beta-lactamases, MRSA-related categories, etc.).
- A comprehensive mapping is provided linking ARDB genes to their gene names and antibiotic classes (extensive gene list with aliases and classifications such as bla, tet, erm, van, qac, sul, etc.).

## Data processing and referenced methodology
- Data interpretation relies on established qPCR normalization and relative expression methods (Livak & Schmittgen 2001) for calculating relative gene abundances.
- The ARDB-based gene name mappings and categorizations are informed by prior datasets and database conventions (Liu & Pop 2009; Zhu et al. 2013, 2017; Looft et al. 2012).

## Data quality, limitations, and potential uses
- Detection limit is Ct 37; abundance values are relative rather than absolute counts.
- Data are tied to a specific geographic region (NE England) and to soil contexts defined by metal content and urban/rural land-use, which may affect generalizability.
- 16S rRNA as a proxy for total bacterial load provides a normalization approach but may not capture all ecological nuances.
- Rich ARDB gene and antibiotic-class mappings enable broad analyses of resistance gene diversity across treatments.
