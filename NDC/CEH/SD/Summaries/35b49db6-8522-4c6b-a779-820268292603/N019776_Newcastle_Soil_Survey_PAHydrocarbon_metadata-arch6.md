# Community antimicrobial resistance genes and concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals in NE England soils

## Overview
- A dataset describing the relative abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes in DNA extracted from soils around Newcastle upon Tyne.
- Sampling design based on preselected locations with varying metal concentrations and land-use (rural/urban) to represent four treatments: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
- Fieldwork conducted in June 2016, targeting the upper soil horizon (<15 cm depth) and samples stored refrigerated for processing.

## Fieldwork details
- Sample locations chosen using prior metal concentration data and land-use patterns.
- Four treatment combinations: low-metal/rural, low-metal/urban, high-metal/rural, high-metal/urban.
- Samples collected from the upper horizon and kept refrigerated until subsequent analyses.

## Analytical methods
- Soil moisture: determined in triplicate by drying in porcelain crucibles at 105 °C; moisture expressed as % of dry mass.
- Total Organic Carbon (TOC): measured in triplicate with a LECO CS244 carbon analyser using infrared detection; reported as % of total dry weight.
- Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN): quantified following standard methods (APHA, 2010); reported as % of dry weight.
- Soil pH: determined on a soil-water slurry (1:5 v/v), equilibrated overnight, then measured with a pH meter (ISO 10390:2005).
- Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH): analyzed by Northumbrian Water Scientific Services via Soxhlet extraction followed by GC-MS.

## Data structure and units
- Main data columns include:
  - Rural/Urban: land-use category (A)
  - Location: common name (B)
  - Latitude (column C) and Longitude (column D)
  - pH (column E)
  - Total Organic Carbon (column F) as % dry weight
  - Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (column G) as % dry weight
  - EPA 16 Priority PAH (columns H–W): individual PAHs
  - Total PAH: sum of the EPA 16 Priority PAHs
- PAH values are expressed in parts-per-million (ppm) or mg/kg of soil; TOC and TKN are expressed as % of dry-weight soil.

## Data quality and notes
- Replicates: moisture, TOC, and TKN analyses performed in triplicate to ensure reliability.
- Data interpretation considerations include variability due to patchy soils, depth restriction to upper horizon, and integration of multiple analytical methods.
