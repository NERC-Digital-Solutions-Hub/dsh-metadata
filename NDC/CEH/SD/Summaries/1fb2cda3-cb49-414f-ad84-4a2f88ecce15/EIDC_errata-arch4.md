# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

## Summary of erratum
- The dataset titled “Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England” has been withdrawn.
- It has been superseded by a new version: “Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2” (identifier a75b9569-948a-4bb2-97a5-6863717881c8).
- Rationale: one author, Richard Pywell, felt the high-resolution quadrat locations could enable pinpointing land locations, potentially upsetting landowners because the data also indicate loss of important grassland habitats.
- The new version provides locations at a 10km grid reference resolution.
