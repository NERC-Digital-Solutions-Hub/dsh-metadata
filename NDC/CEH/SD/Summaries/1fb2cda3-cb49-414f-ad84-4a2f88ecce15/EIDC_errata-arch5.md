# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

## What happened
- The dataset “Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England” has been withdrawn.
- It has been superseded by “Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2,” which uses a 10km grid reference resolution for locations.

## Why this change
- One author (Richard Pywell) was concerned that the high-resolution quadrat locations could allow pinpointing landowners, potentially upsetting them because the data also indicates habitat loss.

## What changed
- The new version (v2) includes locations at a 10km grid reference resolution, reducing pinpointing risk.
- The original high-resolution location data has been withdrawn.

## Implications for data governance
- Privacy and disclosure risk: high-resolution location data could reveal landowner positions and sensitive habitat information.
- Data sharing and access: need to update references to the superseded dataset and provide access to the updated v2 dataset.
- Metadata and provenance: document the resolution change, versioning, and rationale to maintain clear provenance.
- Interoperability and analyses: researchers relying on high-resolution data may need to adapt to the coarser 10km resolution.

## Actions for Data Stewards
- Update catalogues and metadata to reflect withdrawal of the original dataset and the availability of v2.
- Ensure proper versioning and provenance links between the withdrawn dataset and v2.
- Provide clear guidance to data users about the change in spatial resolution and its implications for analyses.
- Review and reinforce data governance practices for sensitive location data, including considerations for privacy and landowner consent.
- Consider and document data sharing arrangements or access controls appropriate for sensitive ecological data in future releases.
