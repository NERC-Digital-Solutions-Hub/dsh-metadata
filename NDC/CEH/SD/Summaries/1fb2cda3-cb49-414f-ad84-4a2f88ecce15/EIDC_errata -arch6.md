# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/http://doi.org/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

## Overview
- The dataset Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England has been withdrawn and superseded by a new version.

## Reason for withdrawal
- High spatial precision of quadrat locations could allow pinpointing land locations.
- This may upset landowners and reveal information about the loss of important grassland habitats.

## What changed in v2
- Superseded by Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2.
- Version includes locations at the 10km grid reference resolution.
- Version identifier: a75b9569948a-4bb2-97a5-6863717881c8.

## Implications for users
- Reduced spatial precision (10km grid) limits analyses that depended on exact quadrat coordinates.
- Users should transition to the v2 dataset for access and analyses, noting the change in resolution.

## Recommendations for data support
- Communicate the update to stakeholders and datasets users.
- Update catalogs and references to point to the v2 dataset.
- Provide guidance on how to adapt analyses to the coarser 10km resolution.
