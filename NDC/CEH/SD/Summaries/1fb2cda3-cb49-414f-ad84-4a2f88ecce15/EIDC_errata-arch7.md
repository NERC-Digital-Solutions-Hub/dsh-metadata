# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

## What happened
- The dataset titled "Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England" has been withdrawn.
- It has been superseded by "Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2" (identifier a75b9569948a-4bb2-97a5-6863717881c8).

## Why the change
- One of the authors (Richard Pywell) felt that the high-resolution quadrat locations could be used to pinpoint exact land locations.
- Pinpointing land locations may upset landowners because the data also conveys information about the loss of important grassland habitats.

## What v2 changes
- The new version includes locations at the 10km grid reference resolution (coarser spatial detail).

## Implications for GIS work
- Privacy and ethics: higher consideration for landowner interests and sensitive location information.
- Spatial analysis implications: shift from high-resolution, fine-grained mapping to coarser grid-based mapping; potential impact on analyses requiring precise quadrat locations.
- Data stewardship: need to reference and use the v2 dataset moving forward; manage versioning and provenance accordingly.

## How to proceed
- For analyses and map products needing broader spatial context, use the v2 dataset with 10km grid references.
- If high-resolution detail is required, note that the original high-resolution data has been withdrawn and is superseded.
