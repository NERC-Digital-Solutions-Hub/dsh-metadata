# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

## Overview
- A dataset concerning historic grassland surveys and contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England has been withdrawn.
- It has been superseded by a new version with adjusted spatial resolution.

## Reason for withdrawal
- One of the dataset’s authors (Richard Pywell) raised privacy concerns about the high-resolution quadrat locations.
- High-resolution data could enable pinpointing land locations, potentially upsetting landowners and revealing information about habitat losses.

## Superseded dataset and new version
- Withdrawn dataset: Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England.
- Superseding dataset: Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2.
- New version details: Location information provided at 10km grid reference resolution to reduce identifiability and privacy risks.

## Implications for monitoring and data governance
- Highlights the need to balance data utility with privacy and stakeholder safeguards in environmental monitoring.
- Demonstrates the importance of adopting privacy-preserving spatial resolutions when sharing sensitive ecological data.
- Underlines potential barriers to data sharing when precise location data are involved, reinforcing the role of clear data governance and metadata to communicate restrictions.

## Practical considerations for authors of monitoring frameworks
- When designing monitoring frameworks, consider implementing versioning and clear disclosure of spatial resolution and access limitations.
- Ensure data provenance, ethics, and stakeholder concerns are documented to facilitate responsible data sharing.
- Assess whether coarse-resolution data remain suitable for policy evaluation and decision-making, and plan alternative analytical approaches if precision is reduced.
