# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

## Overview
- The dataset “Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England” has been withdrawn and superseded by a new version.

## Change details
- Superseded by: “Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2” (identifier: a75b9569948a-4bb2-97a5-6863717881c8).
- Key change: new dataset provides locations at the 10km grid reference resolution.

## Rationale
- Withdrawal due to privacy and sensitivity concerns: the high-resolution quadrat locations could allow pinpointing landowners’ parcels.
- The data also contains information about the loss of important grassland habitats, which could be sensitive.

## Implications for data users
- Analyses or outputs that depended on precise quadrat locations may no longer be feasible or appropriate.
- Data products, dashboards, or reports may need updating to reflect the coarser 10km resolution.
- Stakeholders and landowners’ sensitivities must be considered; ensure compliant sharing and use of the v2 dataset.

## Actions for users and data support
- Transition to the v2 dataset and update all references and workflows.
- Communicate changes to end users and stakeholders; reassess data products for suitability at 10km resolution.
- Update metadata and documentation to reflect new spatial resolution and any resulting changes in analyses or visualizations.
