# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

## Summary of changes
- The dataset "Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England" has been withdrawn.
- It has been superseded by "Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2" (a75b9569948a-4bb2-97a5-6863717881c8).

## Rationale
- One of the authors, Richard Pywell, felt that the high resolution of quadrat locations can allow pinpointing the land where the quadrats were taken.
- This may upset landowners as the data also provides information about the loss of important grassland habitats.

## Version 2 details
- The superseded dataset has been replaced with a version 2 that includes locations at the 10km grid reference resolution.
