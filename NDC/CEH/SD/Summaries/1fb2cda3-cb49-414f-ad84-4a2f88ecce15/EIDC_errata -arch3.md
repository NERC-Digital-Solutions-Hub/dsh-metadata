# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

- Dataset title: Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England
- Action taken: The dataset has been withdrawn and superseded by a revised version
- New version: Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2
- Replacement dataset identifier: a75b9569948a-4bb2-97a5-6863717881c8
- Reason for withdrawal and supersession:
  - One author (Richard Pywell) felt that high-resolution quadrat locations could allow pinpointing landowners
  - The high-resolution data could reveal information about the loss of important grassland habitats, potentially upsetting landowners
- Change in the new version:
  - Spatial locations are provided at the 10km grid reference resolution (coarser, less precise)
- Implications for data governance and monitoring practice:
  - Demonstrates balancing data usefulness with privacy and landowner concerns
  - Highlights the need to consider data sensitivity, consent, and potential harm when releasing spatially explicit information
  - Indicates importance of versioning and clear notices when data granularity is reduced
  - Suggests ensuring metadata communicates spatial precision and any access or sharing constraints to end users
