# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

- What happened
  - The dataset titled 'Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England' has been withdrawn and superseded by a new version titled 'Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2'.
  - The withdrawal was initiated because one of the authors, Richard Pywell, was concerned that the high-resolution quadrat locations could allow pinpointing landholding sites, potentially upsetting landowners since the data also indicate habitat loss.

- What changed
  - The new version (v2) provides locations at a 10 km grid reference resolution instead of high-resolution quadrat locations.

- Implications for data leadership and governance
  - Data sensitivity and privacy: demonstrates the need to balance data utility with protective measures for landowners and sensitive habitat information.
  - Data versioning and provenance: emphasizes the importance of maintaining clear version histories and documenting changes in spatial resolution.
  - Access and risk management: the shift to coarser resolution can affect analyses that rely on precise locations; ensure stakeholders are aware of the change.
  - Metadata and discoverability: update metadata to reflect resolution, purpose, and any restrictions; ensure discoverability of the v2 dataset.

- Practical next steps for organisations
  - Direct users to the v2 dataset and communicate the change in spatial resolution and its implications for ongoing projects.
  - Review data governance policies around high-resolution spatial data and consider similar protective approaches where appropriate.
  - Update data catalogs, documentation, and user guidance to reflect the withdrawal of the original dataset and the availability of the v2 version.
