# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/...

- The dataset "Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England" has been withdrawn.
- It has been superseded by "Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2" (identifier a75b9569948a-4bb2-97a5-6863717881c8).
- Reason for withdrawal: one author (Richard Pywell) raised concerns that the high-resolution quadrat locations could pinpoint the land where quadrats were taken, potentially upsetting landowners because the data also provide information about the loss of important grassland habitats.
- Superseding changes: the new version 2 provides locations at a 10 km grid reference resolution.
- Implications for monitoring and analysis:
  - Updates to datasets used for assessing environmental condition; researchers should refer to v2.
  - Privacy and stakeholder considerations addressed by reducing locational precision.
  - Maintains overall value for monitoring while offering greater data privacy.
- Practical considerations for analysts:
  - Ensure use of the v2 dataset in ongoing monitoring and reporting.
  - Update data provenance and storage practices to reflect the new version.
  - Be aware of the trade-off between spatial precision and privacy in environmental datasets.
