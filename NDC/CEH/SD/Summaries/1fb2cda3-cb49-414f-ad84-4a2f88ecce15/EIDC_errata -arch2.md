# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

- Overview
  - The dataset “Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England” has been withdrawn and superseded by a new version titled “Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2.”
- Reason for withdrawal
  - One author (Richard Pywell) raised privacy/landownerConcerns: high-resolution quadrat locations could enable pinpointing land locations.
  - The detailed locations could reveal information about the loss of important grassland habitats, potentially upsetting landowners.
- Supersession details
  - Superseded by version 2 (v2) with locations provided at 10km grid reference resolution.
  - Aim: preserve broader spatial context and data usability while reducing identifiability and privacy risks.
- Implications for data use
  - Reduced spatial precision may affect analyses requiring exact quadrat coordinates.
  - Enables continued use of the dataset with a privacy-protective resolution, maintaining overall utility for monitoring and policy assessment.
- Data governance and practice implications
  - Demonstrates versioning and errata documentation to balance data value with stakeholder privacy.
  - Highlights a practice of adjusting data granularity rather than removing data entirely to address ethical concerns.
- Relevance for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Emphasizes consideration of privacy, landowner sensitivities, and ethical data sharing in environmental datasets.
  - Illustrates how standard monitoring datasets may need to be updated to maintain trust and data integrity.
- Practical guidance for users
  - Refer to and base analyses on the v2 dataset.
  - Check the spatial resolution when designing analyses and mapping outputs; expect differences in results where fine-scale locations were previously used.
