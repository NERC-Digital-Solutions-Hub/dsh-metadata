# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/1fb2cda3-cb49-414f-ad844a2f88ecce15

## What happened
- The dataset "Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England" has been withdrawn.
- It has been superseded by "Historic grassland survey data with contemporary spatial habitat data for semi-natural grasslands across England v2".

## Reason for withdrawal
- One of the dataset’s authors (Richard Pywell) felt that the high-resolution locations of quadrats could enable pinpointing land parcels.
- This could upset landowners and reveal information about habitat loss, raising privacy and disclosure concerns.

## What changed in v2
- Location data are now provided at a 10km grid reference resolution to reduce pinpointing risk.
- The update aims to maintain usefulness while mitigating privacy and sensitivity issues.

## Governance and metadata implications
- Update data catalogs and portals to reflect withdrawal of the original and publication of v2.
- Document the reason for withdrawal, the resolution change, and any ongoing access limitations.
- Include clear notes on privacy risks and disclosure controls in metadata to guide users.

## Actions for Data Stewards
- Redirect references from the withdrawn dataset to the new v2 version.
- Ensure portals enforce the new 10km resolution and any access restrictions.
- Communicate changes to data users, highlighting how the reduced resolution might affect analyses.
- Maintain provenance by recording version history and linking the old dataset to v2.

## Impact on users and workflows
- Analyses requiring high-precision location data may be affected; switch to v2 or adjust methods accordingly.
- Users should review methodological implications of the 10km grid ref resolution for their studies.

## Next steps for stakeholders
- Confirm licensing or access terms with the dataset authors.
- Monitor for any further updates or additional privacy-preserving measures.
