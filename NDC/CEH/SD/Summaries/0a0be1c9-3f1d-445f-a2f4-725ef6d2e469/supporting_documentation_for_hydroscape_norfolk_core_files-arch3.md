# This document describes the headings used to record the stratigraphic data collected for each core.

## Overview
- Defines the headings (determinands) used to record stratigraphic data for each core.
- Data are organized as a matrix: columns are determinands and rows are contiguous core-depth intervals.
- Blanks indicate no measurement.

## Core identification and depth
- Sub_ID: Internal Amphora database unique ID for the core slice.
- Top_Depth_cm / Bottom_Depth_cm: Distance from the sediment/water interface to the top and bottom of the sliced core section.

## Physical properties and lithology
- DW: Mass of sediment after drying at 105°C for 24 hours, expressed as a percentage of wet weight.
- LOI_550: Percentage of dry weight lost after combustion at 550°C for 2 hours.
- LOI_950: Carbonate content (%) calculated by combustion at 950°C for 2 hours.
- Wetd: Mass (g) of 1 cm³ of wet sediment.

## Chronology and sedimentation
- Pb210_Total / Pb210_Total_err: Activity of total 210Pb (Bq/kg) and its measurement error.
- Pb210_Supported / Pb210_Supported_err: Activity of supported 210Pb and its error.
- Pb210_Unsupported / Pb210_Unsupported_err: Activity of unsupported 210Pb and its error.
- Cum_Unsupported_Pb210 / Cum_Unsupported_Pb210_err: Cumulative unsupported 210Pb and its error.
- Cs137 / Cs137_err: Activity of 137Cs and its error.
- Am241 / Am241_err: Activity of 241Am and its error.
- Date_AD: Calculated year date (AD).
- Age_yr / Age_yr_err SAR: Age of sediment (years) using the Constant Rate of Supply model and its error.
- SR / SR_err: Sedimentation rate (cm⁻² yr⁻¹) and its error.

## Sediment geochemistry and composition
- Hg_µg/g: Total mercury concentration (µg/g) measured by Cold Vapour Atomic absorption.
- XRF element concentrations: 
  - Na_%, Mg_%, Al_%, Si_%, P_%, S_%, Cl_%, K_%, Ca_%, Ti_%: Major element concentrations expressed as % dry mass.
  - V_µg/g, Cr_µg/g, Mn_%, Fe_%, Co_µg/g, Ni_µg/g, Cu_µg/g, Zn_µg/g, Ga_µg/g, As_µg/g, Br_µg/g, Rb_µg/g, Sr_µg/g, Y_µg/g, Nb_µg/g, Ba_µg/g, Pb_µg/g: Trace/major elements with specified units.
