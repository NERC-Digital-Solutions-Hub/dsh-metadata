# hydroscape_norfolk_core_metadata.csv

## Overview
- Metadata file uploaded to EIDC describing core sediment samples from the Hydroscape Norfolk lakes.
- Data fields capture identifiers, location, sampling details, core characteristics, and dating status to support environmental monitoring and palaeoecological analyses.
- References provided for corer types used: Big Ben and Livingstone.

## Key fields and their meaning
- EIDC File Name / Description: File name uploaded to EIDC (.csv) documenting the dataset.
- WBID / Description: Waterbody Identification number linking to the CEH Lakes database.
- Hydroscape / Description: Name of the Hydroscape region used for the dataset.
- Name / Description: Lake name.
- General location of core / Description: Core collected from the central (often deepest) area of the lake.
- OSGB36_E / OSGB36_N / Description: Easting and Northing coordinates in OSGB36 datum (UK grid reference).
- Water depth at core site (m) / Description: Water surface to sediment surface depth at the core site.
- Core length and type / Description: Length of the core in metres and the corer type used.
- Corer types (references) / Description: Citations for corer types used (Big Ben and Livingstone) with authors and journal details.
- Date core collected / Description: Date of fieldwork and core collection (dd/mm/yyyy); year shown if exact date unknown.
- UCL_Code / Description: Internal UCL code used on bags/database.
- UCL Sample ID / Description: Internal (Amphora) code for the entire sample core (unique ID).
- 210 Pb-dated (Y/N) for / Description: Whether the core is dated using 210Pb methods (Yes or No).
- Hydroscape / Description: Metadata field associated with the Hydroscape designation (contextual descriptor).

## Data provenance and standards
- Source system: UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) Lakes database referenced via the WBID link.
- Coordinate system: OSGB36 for spatial coordinates.
- Dating indicator: 210Pb dating status recorded as Yes/No.
- Core collection details: Includes date, core length, depth, and corer type with literature references to ensure traceability.

## Usage and implications for monitoring
- Enables consistent cross-lake environmental monitoring by standardising core metadata.
- Facilitates quality assurance, data cleaning, and transformation for analyses of environmental health over time.
- Supports integration with other datasets by providing unique IDs (UCL codes and Sample IDs) and provenance details.

## Quality assurance and data access
- Data are verified, quality assured, and transformed before presentation.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals, aligning with monitoring responsibilities and enabling access to underlying data for broader use.
