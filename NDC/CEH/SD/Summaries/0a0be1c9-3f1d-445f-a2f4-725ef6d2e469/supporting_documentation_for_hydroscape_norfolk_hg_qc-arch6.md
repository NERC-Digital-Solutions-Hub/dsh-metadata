# Supporting Documentation for QC file uploaded to EIDC

## Overview
- Describes the table headings showing results of measurements of reference sediment LKSD2 and procedural blanks processed and run with the core sediments measured by Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS).
- Associated file: hydroscape_norfolk_hg _cores_qc.csv

## Data fields and meanings
- Glasgow Hg Core Runs, Description: Name of Hg cores run through the CV-AFS machine.
- Tube Code, Description: Tube code (e.g., LKSD2…).
- Standard Sediment Mass, Description: Mass of reference sediment weighed out (~0.2 g).
- Hg ng/g, Description: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as ng/g.
- Hg µg/g, Description: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as µg/g.
- Measured blank (ng/ml), Description: Concentration of Hg measured in procedural blank (ng/ml).

## Reference sediment standard
- LKSD2 Reference Sediment Value: 160 ± 19 ng/g
- Partial Extraction using HNO3

## Method
- Measurements performed on core sediments using Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS).

## Documentation and provenance
- References Lynch, J. (1990): Provisional Elemental Values for LKSD reference materials LKSD-1 to LKSD-4, STSD-1 to STSD-4 (Geostandards Newsletter).

## Purpose for end users
- Provides QC data to verify instrument performance and data quality for Hg measurements in core sediments.
- Enables verification of reference material recovery and identification of potential contamination via blanks.
- Supports assessment of measurement precision and consistency across runs.

## Practical usage tips
- Compare core sample Hg ng/g values to the LKSD2 reference value to assess accuracy.
- Review Measured Blank values to ensure blanks are low and not influencing sample results.
- Use the stated Standard Sediment Mass (~0.2 g) for reproducibility and cross-sample comparisons.
