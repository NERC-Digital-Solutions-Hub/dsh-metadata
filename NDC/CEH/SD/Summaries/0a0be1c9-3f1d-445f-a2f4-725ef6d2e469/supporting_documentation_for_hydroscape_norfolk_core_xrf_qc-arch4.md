# hydroscape_norfolk_xrf_cores_qc.csv

## Purpose and scope
- Describes the table of results from XRF measurements of standard reference materials during co-measurement of core materials (QA/QC).
- Aims to ensure instrument stability and assess reliability of elemental identifications.

## What is reported
- Measured values during the run and certified values for the sediments.
- For each standard (BR1, LKSD2, JLK1): mean and standard deviation of measured concentrations; certified values; % recovery (difference between measured and certified, expressed as a percentage).
- A recovery of 95–105% is considered very good.

## Data structure and key variables
- Core_Code_Measured_Reference Standard_statistics: sediment core code and named standard reference sediment with statistics.
- Measured_Mean_BR1, Measured_SD_BR1, Certified_Value_BR1, %Recovery_BR1.
- Measured_Mean_LKSD2, Measured_SD_LKSD2, Certified_Value_LKSD2, %Recovery_LKSD2.
- Certified_Value_JLK1, %Recovery_JLK1.
- Elemental concentrations by category:
  - %dry mass: Na_%, Mg_%, Al_%, Si_%, P_%, S_%, Cl_%, K_%, Ca_%, Ti_%.
  - µg/g: V_µg/g, Cr_µg/g, Co_µg/g, Ni_µg/g, Cu_µg/g, Zn_µg/g, Ga_µg/g, As_µg/g, Br_µg/g, Rb_µg/g, Sr_µg/g, Y_µg/g, Nb_µg/g, Ba_µg/g, Pb_µg/g.
- Notes: some elements listed with %dry mass, others with µg/g units.

## Units and reference materials
- Values such as Na_%, Mg_%, Al_%, Si_%, P_%, S_%, Cl_%, K_%, Ca_%, Ti_% are expressed as % dry mass.
- Trace elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb) are expressed in µg/g.
