# Supporting Documentation for QC file uploaded to EIDC

## Overview
- Describes table headings showing results of measurements of reference sediment LKSD2 and procedural blanks processed and run with core sediments measured by Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS).
- Associated file: hydroscape_norfolk_hg _cores_qc.csv.

## Table headings and data fields
- Glasgow Hg Core Runs: Name of Hg cores run through CV-AFS machine.
- Tube Code, Description: Tube code (LKSD2…).
- Standard Sediment mass, Description: Mass of Reference sediment weighed out (~0.2 g).
- Hg ng/g, Description: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as ng/g.
- Hg µg/g, Description: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as µg/g.
- Measured blank (ng/ml), Description: Concentration of Hg measured in procedural blank (ng/ml).

## Reference material and QC values
- LKSD2 Reference Sediment Value: 160 ± 19 ng/g.
- Partial Extraction using HNO3.

## Methodology and quality control
- Measurements are performed on core sediments using CV-AFS.
- Procedural blanks are measured and recorded (ng/ml) as part of QC.

## Standards and references
- Lynch, J. (1990): Provisional elemental values for LKSD and STSD reference materials ( LKSD-1 to LKSD-4, STSD-1 to STSD-4 ).

## Context for environmental monitoring
- Supports standardized, comparable reporting of mercury in sediment cores for environmental health and policy monitoring.
- Aids data quality assurance by documenting reference materials, measurement details, and blank corrections.
