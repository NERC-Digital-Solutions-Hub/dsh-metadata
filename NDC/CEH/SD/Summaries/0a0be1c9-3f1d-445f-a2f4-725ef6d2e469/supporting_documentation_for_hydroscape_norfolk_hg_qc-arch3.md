# Supporting Documentation for QC file uploaded to EIDC

## Overview
- Describes the table headings showing results of measurements of reference sediment (LKSD2) and procedural blanks processed and run with the core sediments measured by CV-AFS.
- Serves as quality control documentation for Hg measurements in core sediments.

## Data and Measurements Described
- Glasgow Hg Core Runs: Names of Hg cores run through CV-AFS.
- Tube Code, Description: Tube code (e.g., LKSD2) and its description.
- Standard Sediment Mass, Description: Mass of reference sediment weighed out (~0.2 g).
- Hg ng/g, Description: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as ng/g.
- Hg µg/g, Description: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as µg/g.
- Measured Blank (ng/ml), Description: Concentration of Hg measured in procedural blank (ng/ml).

## Reference Sediment
- LKSD2 Reference Sediment Value: 160 ± 19 ng/g.
- Partial Extraction using HNO3.
