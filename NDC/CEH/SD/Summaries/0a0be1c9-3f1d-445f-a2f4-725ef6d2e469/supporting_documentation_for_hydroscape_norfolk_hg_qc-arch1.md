## Overview
- Describes the table headings showing results of measurements of reference sediment (LKSD2) and procedural blanks processed and run with the core sediments measured by Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS).

## Data columns and meanings
- Glasgow Hg Core Runs, Description: Name of Hg cores run through CV-AFS machine.
- Tube Code, Description: Tube code (LKSD2…).
- Standard Sediment mass, Description: Mass of Reference sediment weighed out (~0.2 g).
- Hg ng/g, Description: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as ng/g.
- Hg µg/g, Description: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as µg/g.
- Measured blank (ng/ml), Description: Concentration of Hg measured in procedural blank (ng/ml).

## Reference sediment and values
- LKSD2 Reference Sediment Value = 160 ± 19 ng/g.
- Partial Extraction using HNO3.

## Method and context
- Analysis performed on core sediments using CV-AFS (Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy).
- Reference to LKSD-2 as a Geostandards Reference Material.
