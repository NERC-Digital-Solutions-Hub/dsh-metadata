# Supporting Documentation for QC file uploaded to EIDC

- Associated file: hydroscape_norfolk_hg _cores_qc.csv

## Purpose
- Describes the table headings showing results of measurements of reference sediment LKSD2 and procedural blanks processed and run with core sediments measured by Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS).

## Data fields / table headings
- Glasgow Hg Core Runs: Name of Hg cores run through CV-AFS machine.
- Tube Code, Description: Tube code (LKSD2…).
- Standard Sediment mass, Description: Mass of Reference sediment weighed out (~0.2 g).
- Hg ng/g, Description: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as ng/g.
- Hg µg/g, Description: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as µg/g.
- Measured blank (ng/ml), Description: Concentration of Hg measured in procedural blank (ng/ml).

## Reference material
- LKSD2 Reference Sediment Value = 160 ± 19 ng/g.
- Partial Extraction using HNO3.

## Method
- CV-AFS (Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy) used for core sediments.
- Partial extraction performed with nitric acid (HNO3).

## Quality control context
- Documents QC data for Hg measurements in sediments to support data accuracy, comparability, and proper handling of blanks and reference materials.
