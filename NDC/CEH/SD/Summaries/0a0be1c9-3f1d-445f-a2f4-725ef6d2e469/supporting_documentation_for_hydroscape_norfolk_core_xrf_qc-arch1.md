# hydroscape_norfolk_xrf_cores_qc.csv

## Purpose and scope
- Describes the table of results from XRF measurements of standard reference materials co-measured with core materials to QA/QC instrument stability and measurement reliability for element identification.
- Presents measured values, certified values, and the recovery (% difference between measured and certified) for each reference standard.

## What the data cover
- Each row links a sediment core (WBID_Core Code) with a named standard reference sediment.
- For each reference standard (BR1, LKSD2, JLK1), the table provides:
  - Measured_Mean (e.g., BR1, LKSD2)
  - Measured_SD (standard deviation across runs)
  - Certified_Value (reference value for the element in that standard)
  - %Recovery (difference between measured and certified value expressed as a percentage)
- Concentration data are provided for a wide suite of elements, reported as:
  - Percent dry mass for major elements (e.g., Na_%, Mg_%, Al_%, Si_%, P_%, S_%, Cl_%, K_%, Ca_%, Ti_%)
  - Micrograms per gram (µg/g) for trace elements (e.g., V_µg/g, Cr_µg/g, Co_µg/g, Ni_µg/g, Cu_µg/g, Zn_µg/g, Ga_µg/g, As_µg/g, Br_µg/g, Rb_µg/g, Sr_µg/g, Y_µg/g, Nb_µg/g, Ba_µg/g, Pb_µg/g)
- The description confirms the units and the ordering of elements in the table.

## QA/QC interpretation
- A recovery of 95–105% is considered very good, indicating strong agreement between measured and certified values.
- The mean and standard deviation across runs (Measured_Mean and Measured_SD) quantify instrument precision and repeatability for each standard.
- The comparison across BR1, LKSD2, and JLK1 provides multiple references to validate measurements and detect potential biases.

## Reference materials
- Ref 1: Epstein MS, Diamondstone BI, Gills TE. A new river sediment standard reference material.
- Ref 2: Lynch, J. Provisional Elemental Values for LKSD reference materials.
- Ref 3: Terashima et al. Elemental concentrations in new GSJ sedimentary rock reference samples.

## How to use the data (analyst perspective)
- Check %Recovery values to assess measurement accuracy for each element against each reference standard.
- Use Measured_Mean and Measured_SD to evaluate precision across runs and stability of the XRF instrument.
- Compare certified values across BR1, LKSD2, and JLK1 to validate cross-reference consistency.
- Use the comprehensive element list and units to ensure correct interpretation and downstream data harmonization across cores.
