## Purpose and Context
- Describes the table of results from XRF measurements of standard reference materials co-measured with core sediments.
- Aims to ensure instrument stability during operation and assess reliability of elemental identification (QA/QC).
- Compares measured values to certified reference values for sediments; uses mean, standard deviation, and percent recovery to evaluate accuracy.

## Data and Methods
- Outputs include:
  - Measured values (means and SDs) for standard references BR1, LKSD2, and JLK1.
  - Certified values for the same standards.
  - Percent recovery (%Recovery) calculated as the difference between measured and certified values.
- Recovery target: 95–105% considered very good.
- Describes the metadata fields:
  - Core_Code_Measured_Reference Standard_statistics: core name/code and the referenced standard sediment and statistics.
  - Measured_Mean_BR1, Measured_SD_BR1, Certified_Value_BR1, %Recovery_BR1.
  - Measured_Mean_LKSD2, Measured_SD_LKSD2, Certified_Value_LKSD2, %Recovery_LKSD2.
  - Certified_Value_JLK1, %Recovery_JLK1.
- Element concentration measurements include:
  - Major/trace elements expressed as % dry mass: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti.
  - Trace element concentrations: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb (units: µg/g where specified).

## Key Metrics and Interpretation
- Recovery values indicate measurement accuracy relative to standards; 95–105% recovery is considered very good.
- The combination of mean, SD, and recovery across multiple reference standards provides a robust QA/QC check for the sediment core measurements.

## Outputs and Accessibility
- Results are structured to support standardized reporting formats (reports, maps, charts) and integration into monitoring portals.
- Emphasizes that QA/QC outputs should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for transparency and reuse.

## Standards and References
- Reference standards and literature used to support the reference values:
  - Ref 1: Epstein MS et al. (1989) A new river sediment standard reference material. Talanta.
  - Ref 2: Lynch, J. (1990). Provisional Elemental Values for LKSD series. Geostandards Newsletter.
  - Ref 3: Terashima et al. (1990). Elemental concentrations in nine new GSJ sedimentary rock reference samples. Geostandards Newsletter.
- Note: The document lists multiple references (with a repeated label for Ref 2) that underpin the standard reference materials used (LKSD-1, LKSD-2, LKSD-3, etc.).

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring
- Provides validated, time-consistent QA/QC metrics to support environmental health assessments based on sediment core analyses.
- Enables data users to trust element identifications and concentrations, underpinning policy performance evaluations over time.
- The standardized QA/QC framework aids in making underlying measurement data more accessible and reusable for broader analyses.
