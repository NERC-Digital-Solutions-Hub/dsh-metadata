# FIELD HANDBOOK

## Purpose and Context
- Provides guidelines for CS2000 to monitor the rural environment using a standardized, repeatable data framework.
- Supports time-series assessments of environmental health and informs policy objectives.
- Outlines sampling across soils, vegetation (Calluna), and freshwater biota, with collaboration between CS2000 field surveyors, ITE Merlewood, and the Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE).
- Emphasizes data quality, standardized methodologies, and clear data flow to policy-relevant outputs.

## Sampling and Field Procedures (Section 10)
- Types of sampling:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by IFE staff)
- Rationale:
  - Build a national, spatially referenced soil dataset to establish baseline soil quality and biological activity indices.
- Soil sampling in each 1 km square:
  - Five replicate soil samples taken per X-plot center; samples processed at ITE Merlewood.
  - In each X-plot, three cores are collected: one long (black pipe) and two short (white pipes).
- Equipment distribution:
  - Items marked with an asterisk (*) distributed to each team.
  - Items marked with a hash (#) distributed according to square allocation among field teams.
  - Includes containers, pipes, envelopes, and lab packaging to accompany samples to ITE Merlewood.
- Sampling procedure (centre plot in each X-plot):
  - Locate the north corner; mark a point 15 cm north for first soil sample (center plot area 2 x 2 m).
  - Use the long black pipe to collect the first soil core; level with surface using an aluminum plate; extract and bag soil; store in the boot of the car until collection.
  - Take the second soil sample 15 cm east using a short white pipe; package and seal for posting.
  - Take the third soil sample 15 cm west using the remaining white pipe; seal and post.
  - Repeat for all centre plots in each X-plot (total of five soil sampling locations per square).
- Calluna sampling (10.8–10.10):
  - Collect current year’s growth (CYG) from Calluna vulgaris plants (30–50 g fresh weight per sample).
  - Randomly sample CYG shoots; seal in provided bags; label clearly; dry if wet before sealing.
  - Despatch samples to ITE Merlewood via appropriate routes; retain receipts for T&S claims.
- Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11):
  - Coordinated with IFE; trained survey staff may work in squares simultaneously with IFE; scheduling coordinated by CS2000 co-ordinators.

## Photography (Section 11)
- Equipment:
  - One camera per team; initial stock of film; additional film to be purchased as needed.
- Procedures:
  - Photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks.
  - Use obvious, unique, permanent reference features; include square and plot numbers on a marker board visible in each photo.
  - Compose shots so that up to half the frame shows the plot with reference features; avoid excessive sky.
  - Examples and guidelines provided at Field Training Courses.

## Procedures After Survey (Section 12)
- Daily data checks:
  - Read data sheets to ensure no omissions; transposition only in emergencies (damage/spoiling of original maps).
- Transport:
  - Ensure FABs and samples are returned to ITE Stations promptly.

## Annex 1 – Collecting GPS Data
- GPS readiness:
  - Check battery, satellites (minimum four; PDOP ideally below 6 for accurate 3D fixes).
- Recording stationary positions:
  - Record at each vegetation plot; leave GPS recording active for 3–5 minutes in unobstructed locations.
- Recording moving features:
  - For new boundaries in upland areas, record from start to end of the feature.
- File naming:
  - Each plot/feature must have a unique data file name (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4).
  - New features use descriptive names (e.g., 501F1.MOB); note the mobile file name on the FAB.
- Data logging:
  - Configure data sampling rate (1-second intervals); be sure to select the correct plot/feature from the attribute list.
  - Use the logging screen to start/stop and monitor time stamps.
- Scheduling and recharging:
  - Manage battery charge; download or update almanac if prompted by the GPS receiver.
- PDOP and obstructions:
  - Avoid obstructed views (hedges, buildings, trees); elevate the aerial if needed.
- User interface:
  - Use the Magellan keypad for entering numbers/letters; use the attribute reference to quickly select plots.
- Recording guidance:
  - Seek clear sky views for best accuracy; allow sufficient recording duration in obstructed conditions.

## Key Data and Operational Considerations for Analysts
- Standardized, repeatable sampling across soils, Calluna, and freshwater to enable robust time-series analyses.
- Clear data handling and submission pathways to ITE Merlewood and IFE; emphasis on traceability and quality assurance.
- Integration of field observations with GPS-based plot relocation to support accurate, comparable spatial datasets.
- Emphasis on documenting permissions, sample transport, and post-survey data integrity to maintain long-term data usability for policy evaluation and biodiversity targets.
