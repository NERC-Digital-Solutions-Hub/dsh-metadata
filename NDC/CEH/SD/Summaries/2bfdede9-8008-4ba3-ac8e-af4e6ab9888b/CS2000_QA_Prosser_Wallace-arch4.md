# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Overview
  - Purpose: quantify consistency and reliability of field recording across a large, multi-scriber program.
  - Scope: QA on 38 of 519 squares surveyed in CS1998; resurvey of one quarter in each square; 234 species plots across nine plot types; evaluation across: plot relocation, species concordance, percentage cover, direction of change bias, comparability with CS1990, land-use mapping accuracy, and recording of changes.
  - Outcome focus: assess data quality, identify observer and process biases, and relate findings to prior CS surveys.

- Methods and scope
  - Sample design: 38 squares selected from 519; one quarter resurveyed; 234 plots distributed across plot types (quadrats, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, etc.).
  - Plating and location: buried markers (plates) used to locate plots; relocation efficiency assessed eight years after burial; plots and plates categorized by relocation success.
  - Data comparisons: CS2000 survey records vs QA assessors’ records, plus comparisons to CS1990/1991 QA benchmarks.
  - Analyses included: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, cover estimates, identification errors, misplacements/orientations, land-cover code concordance (primary, secondary, boundary), and land-use change evaluations.

- Key findings by category

 1) Plot relocation
  - Of 210 plots with a full search, 86.7% were satisfactorily relocated; 60% of CS2000 surveyors’ plots were accurately relocated, ~25% more or less relocated, ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - QA assessors located 69.3% of plates; overall relocation success compared to CS1990 QA around 40–45% when considering all factors.
  - Issues included misplacement across banks, hedges, or fences; occasional use of new plates, complicating future re-locations.
  - Conclusion: eight years on, relocation remains feasible but with notable location/orientation challenges affecting subsequent data linkage.

- Species concordance and recording accuracy
  - Approximately 71% of CS2000 species records were confirmed by QA assessors; ~2% non-concordances due to real management or seasonal changes.
  - Overall initial field recording accuracy estimated at about 73%, with some portion attributed to plot relocation errors.
  - Across 38 squares, QA and CS2000 showed similar efficiency to the 1990 CS1/QA comparison when adjusted for plot relocation differences.
  - The QA exercise increased mean species counts per plot compared with CS2000 (CS2000 mean ~17.9; QA ~20.4), with consistency in ranking plots by richness across times.

- Vegetation cover estimates
  - Comparison of mean cover for the nine most frequent species showed mixed results; several grasses displayed significant discrepancies, some likely seasonal effects.
  - Overall, cover estimates between CS2000 and QA were reasonably aligned for many species, with notable exceptions (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Elymus repens) showing significant differences.
  - The degree of agreement varied by species type; grasses often driving discrepancies.

- Changes in frequency of the most prevalent species
  - In general, the ranking of common species was broadly similar between CS2000 and QA, though less stable than CS1990 vs QA.
  - Some common species were under- or over-recorded; mosses and certain grass species frequently affected by identification challenges or seasonal variation.
  - When aggregating across plots, the QA identified a roughly comparable pattern of species abundance changes as seen in prior QA rounds, suggesting similar observer performance across surveys.

- Hedge diversity plots
  - Hedge diversity (19 samples) showed higher QA excess in total species count (QA higher than CS2000 by about 14%), with many overlooked species in hedges.
  - Summary: 124 total species recorded; 74.2% overall agreement; 77.4% surveyor efficiency; hedge plots appeared more challenging and often treated as an afterthought in QA.

- Arable plots
  - Only five arable plots; concordance between CS2000 and QA was very poor.
  - Seasonal variations and unfamiliarity with ruderal species contributed to mis-recording; specific issues with Veronica/Euphorbia identifications.
  - Recommendation: for arable margins, plan at least two well-spaced visits to improve reliability.

- Land-use mapping and primary coding
  - Land-cover mapping used primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes; analysis focused on concordance between CS2000 and QA assessors.
  - Primary land-cover codes showed high overall agreement: 91.6% concordance excluding BAPs; 87.5% overall primary land-cover agreement including BAPs; 8% mapping omissions.
  - BAP (broad habitat) codes: 77.4% concordance; overall primary vegetation agreement around 84–88%.
  - Primary boundary features: high concordance; overall boundary code concordance about 92%; boundary height and stockproof status also showed strong agreement.
  - Hedge shapes and boundary conditions: moderate concordance (67.5% for boundary shape/hedge codes); notable miscoding between certain wall and hedge codes reflecting interpretive differences.

- Change in land use and boundary features
  - Change coding: limited concordance on changes between CS2000 and QA; overall change concurrence about 51.4%; many changes noted by CS2000 were not substantiated by QA assessors.
  - A substantial portion of changes observed in CS2000 may have been missed or misclassified by assessors; reliance on field-coded strings may contribute to discrepancies.
  - The exercise indicates that changes since 1990 may be under-recorded; the QA data suggest plot data may be a more reliable basis for detecting change than the change strings alone.

- Overall conclusions and implications for data leadership
  - Strengths: high concordance in primary land-cover and boundary coding; robust labeling and mapping processes; strong capacity to relocate and re-use many plots after years; overall data quality is solid for many map and habitat categories.
  - Weaknesses and challenges: plot relocation and exact location/orientation errors contribute to mis-matches and biased or inaccurate species and cover data; arable margins are particularly prone to mismatch due to seasonality and species familiarity; change detection is notably weaker and requires improved protocols.
  - Implications for data strategy:
    - Emphasize durable, persistent plot markers and robust relocation protocols to reduce location-related errors.
    - Standardize species identification guidance and provide targeted training for grasses and common misidentifications; account for seasonal effects in analyses.
    - Maintain rigorous, auditable change logging procedures and consider integrating change detection with spatial-temporal analyses to improve accuracy.
    - Ensure land-use and boundary coding rules remain consistent across surveys and across different coders to minimize cross-survey discrepancies.
    - For future field programs, plan for multiple field visits in areas prone to rapid vegetation change (e.g., arable margins, hedges) and implement explicit checks for boundary changes.

- Annex and process notes (for data governance)
  - QA methodology included defined plot types, plate-based localization, and cross-time comparison with 1990/1991 QA benchmarks.
  - Tables and annexes provide granular concordance metrics by code group (primary land cover, BAPs, boundaries, hedge shapes, stockproof status), plus per-square efficiency and agreement figures, illustrating where coding decisions diverged and where observer agreement was strongest.

- Takeaways for Data Leaders
  - A robust QA program validates data reliability across complex, multi-actor field campaigns and helps pinpoint where data collection processes need strengthening.
  - Even with high overall concordance, targeted improvements in relocation accuracy, arable plot recording, and change detection can substantially enhance long-term data quality.
  - Structured, codified mapping and change-coding schemas support clearer governance of data products, enabling better downstream analytics and policy use.
