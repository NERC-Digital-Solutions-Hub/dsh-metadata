# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1

## Overview
- Presents national estimates of Broad Habitat percentage increase or decrease between 1990 and 1998, calculated using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Based on Countryside Survey data for Great Britain; mapping output provided as CS90_98_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp.
- Methodology and classification context described in referenced literature.

## Data structure and fields
- LC2007 (number): ITE Land Class (Bunce et al. 1996; 1981; 2007) used for the 2007 classification.
- LC2007_COD (text): ITE Land Class code/name.
- Survey (text): Years of survey (to/from).
- Column1 to Column17 (numbers): Percentage increase or decrease of area for each Broad Habitat category:
  - Column1: Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland
  - Column2: Coniferous Woodland
  - Column3: Boundary and Linear Features
  - Column4: Arable and Horticulture
  - Column5: Improved Grassland
  - Column6: Neutral Grassland
  - Column7: Calcareous Grassland
  - Column8: Acid Grassland
  - Column9: Bracken
  - Column10: Dwarf Shrub Heath
  - Column11: Fen, Marsh, Swamp
  - Column12: Bog
  - Column13: Standing Open Waters and Canals
  - Column14: Rivers and Streams
  - Column15: Montane
  - Column16: Inland Rock
  - Column17: Urban

## Methodology and classification context
- Uses the 2007 ITE Land Classification (GB) as the basis for national estimates.
- Mapping methodology described in Barr (1998) and Barr (1991); ITE Land Classification references include Bunce et al. (1996, 1981, 2007) and Scott (2007).
- National estimates are derived from sample data in 1 km survey squares (CS Technical Report No.4/07).

## Temporal and geographic scope
- Timeframe: Change estimates cover 1990 to 1998.
- Geography: Great Britain (GB).
