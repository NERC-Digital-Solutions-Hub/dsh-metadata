# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1

## Overview
- A Countryside Survey data product estimating changes in Broad Habitat areas in Great Britain between 1990 and 1998.
- National estimates are calculated for Broad Habitat types (Habitats 1–17) using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Data originate from Countryside Survey (NERC–CEH) with methodologies documented in linked references.

## Data structure and key columns

- Column1 (number): Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland — % change in area.
- Column2 (number): Coniferous Woodland — % change in area.
- Column3 (number): Boundary and Linear Features — % change in area.
- Column4 (number): Arable and Horticulture — % change in area.
- Column5 (number): Improved Grassland — % change in area.

- Column12 (number): Bog — % change in area.
- Column13 (number): Standing Open Waters and Canals — % change in area.
- Column14 (number): Rivers and Streams — % change in area.
- Column15 (number): Montane — % change in area.
- Column16 (number): Inland Rock — % change in area.
- Column17 (number): Urban — % change in area.

## Methodology and scope
- National estimates of percent change for each Broad Habitat (Habitats 1–17) are derived from the 1990 and 1998 Countryside Survey data using the 2007 ITE Land Classification framework.
- Mapping methodology and data processing are described in Barr (1998, 1991) and related methodological documents.
- The dataset is delivered as a shapefile (CS90_98_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp) and accompanies a README with column definitions.

## Geographic scope and data use
- Geographic scope: Great Britain.
- Data usage requires formal acknowledgement of Countryside Survey data ownership by NERC–Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
