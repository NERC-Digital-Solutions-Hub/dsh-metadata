# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Purpose: Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey, explain observer/seasonal/location differences, relate findings to previous work, and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Methods and Design

- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares; two independent assessors; used original sketch maps for plot relocation; included plate relocation and nine fixed points per quarter.
  - 1991: 1 km squares from 32 terrain classes; added photographs to aid relocation; self-assessment group trials; targeted same plots closer in time to original survey.
- Plot types (six total):
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X plots) and 4 m2 (Y plots)
  - Linear plots along roadsides and verges
  - Hedges, Streamsides, Boundaries
- relocation and data capture:
  - Attempted to relocate buried metal plates; used sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors; recorded landcover and boundaries at nine predetermined points.
  - Recorded species presence, cover estimates, and boundary/landuse codes.
- Data quality measures:
  - Several concordance indices between time 1 (original) and time 2 (QA) for species lists.
  - Initial efficiency of recording (% accuracy) and overall % agreement per square.
  - Analyses for T1 vs T2 changes, seasonality, crop changes, and plot relocation issues.
- Mapping and landuse coding:
  - Primary landuse codes, secondary descriptive codes, and boundary/cover codes analyzed for reliability and consistency.

## Key Findings

- Overall accuracy and agreement:
  - Initial mean species per plot: ~20.7 (1990); ~23.4 (1991 QA).
  - Overall species list agreement across time 1 vs 2: around 60–61% (with broader calculations around 60.9% in certain analyses).
  - Initial efficiency (timeframe 1990) around 58–74% depending on how variations are treated; after removing 1991 variations, efficiency approached ~74%.
  - A notable 13% increase in observed species per plot in 1991 vs 1990 largely reflects real ecological differences (e.g., drought year 1990 vs more normal 1991) rather than only observer improvement.
- Observer and seasonal effects:
  - Substantial portion of differences due to seasonality, drought, and year-to-year ecological variation; approximately 30% of difference attributed to under-recording in the original survey, ~70% to real year-to-year ecological change.
  - In upland areas, seasonal effects are less pronounced; lowland arable areas showed poorer recording despite overall good effort.
- Plot relocation and plate/photograph utility:
  - Plate relocation success: Autumn 1990 ~71% recovery rate within five minutes; 1991 recovery (plates and plots) ~65%/87% depending on plot type.
  - Photographs significantly improved relocation accuracy, particularly for precise position; photographs plus sketches recommended for better ground-truthing.
- Plot types and landclasses:
  - X plots (relocation easier) and roadverge plots showed higher relocation success; Y plots were particularly challenging.
  - Landclass differences: lowland arable (LC) areas showed lower accuracy; upland (UP) squares generally more accurate.
- Species frequency and cover:
  - Some species showed real changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana, Alliaria) between years; others appeared as under-recorded in 1990 (e.g., Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis) due to seasonal/mgmt differences.
  - Cover estimates between times were generally similar for many species, but some notable differences existed (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Urtica dioica) requiring improved recording protocols.
- Mapping and coding reliability:
  - Primary landuse codes were highly reliable; boundary codes less so, often due to interpretation of hedges and boundaries.
  - Some codes (e.g., marsh, bog, moorland) required clearer definitions; misalignments often stemmed from qualifying codes and multiple-present species.
  - Mapping of vegetation cover at nine-point grid showed ~81% concordance for dominant species; co-dominants had much lower concordance, suggesting focus on top species for reproducibility.
- Cross-era comparisons:
  - DECORANA analysis indicated an overall shift along an ecological gradient between years; uplands showed more clumping and variability, suggesting climate/year effects and landuse changes influence observed patterns.

## Recommendations (Key Points)

- Data capture and plot relocation:
  - Use photographs to re-establish plot positions; annotate photos to link to the specific plots.
  - Persist with metal marker plates for X plots; allocate more manpower for relocation in unenclosed uplands.
  - For Y plots (small plots), define positioning with a survey tape and orient along N-S with the SE corner as reference.
- Documentation and annotation:
  - Surveyors should annotate photographs and relate them to the corresponding plots; include distances and bearings on sketches.
  - Improve and standardize the handling of tree/shrub cover data in field handbooks and analyses.
- Sampling and timing:
  - Conduct QA in the same season and year as the original survey to minimize seasonal biases; limit cross-year comparisons when possible.
- Landuse and vegetation coding:
  - Expand primary landuse codes (with clear dichotomous keys) and reduce emphasis on fine-grained cover for mapping to improve reproducibility.
  - Sub-divide upland land classes (e.g., upland grassland and upland improved meadow) and add codes for lowland rush pasture and wet heath.
  - Restrict primary boundary coding to hedge presence with qualifying codes for species composition.
- Vegetation mapping and species data:
  - Record only the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit to improve reproducibility; broaden bryophyte and key grasses emphasis in training.
  - Explicitly define and standardize bryophyte recording, particularly for wetlands, mires, and other habitat-specific contexts.
- Training and quality assurance:
  - Future QA should align with specific habitat types and landuses; provide targeted field characteristics training to distinguish similar taxa (especially grasses).
  - Use self-assessment and cross-surveyor comparisons to identify persistent areas of disagreement and tailor training accordingly.
- Data interpretation and reporting:
  - When comparing across time, interpret axis shifts (e.g., DECORANA first axis) with caution; distinguish shifts due to management, crop changes, and actual ecological change.
  - Emphasize reporting of the season/year effects and ensure consistent data handling to support robust inferences about ecological change.

## Implications for Data Governance

- Ensuring data quality requires aligning data collection with the same season/year as the original survey, robust relocation methods (photos, markers), and standardized coding schemes.
- Clear, unambiguous landuse and boundary codes improve reproducibility and comparability across time.
- Training should emphasize accurate species identification (especially grasses and bryophytes) and consistent cover estimation practices.
- Metadata and documentation should capture plot relocation methods, photographic annotations, and exact coordinate/orientation details to facilitate future QA and re-use of the data.

## Conclusion

- Photographs and standardized relocation aids are essential for reliable plot repositioning, particularly in unenclosed areas.
- Seasonality and year-to-year ecological variation significantly influence observed species lists and cover; QA should be conducted as close as possible to the original survey period.
- Landuse coding is generally reliable, but boundary and certain habitat codes require clarified definitions and potential subdivisions.
- The study provides a comprehensive framework for QA in landscape vegetation surveys, with concrete recommendations to enhance accuracy, consistency, and usefulness of future Countryside Survey data.
