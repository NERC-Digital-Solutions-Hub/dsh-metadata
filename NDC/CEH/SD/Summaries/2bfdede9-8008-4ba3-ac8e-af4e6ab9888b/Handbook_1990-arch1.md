# Countryside Survey 1990

- Aim and context
  - Purpose: collect and analyse data to identify patterns, correlations, and predictive insights about land use and ecological change; support practical decision-making and academic research.
  - Background: two major GB surveys (1977/8 focused on ecological data; 1984 mapped land cover and landscape features) using the ITE Land Classification System; 1988 survey extended vegetation data collection; 1990 resurvey planned to monitor changes and link top-down remote sensing with ground-truth field data.
  - Approach: two-tier data collection integrating satellite imagery with field surveys; standardised field recording to enable robust trend analyses and modelling; ongoing data provenance and metadata management.

- Study design and planning
  - Sampling frame: Countryside Survey 1990 comprises 512 sites (squares) divided into six groups, with six ITE Research Stations coordinating teams (~85 squares per station).
  - Workplan and logistics: each square estimated to require about three survey days; flexible scheduling; emphasis on minimizing travel and avoiding overtime; no overnight subsistence payments beyond time off in lieu for excessive overtime.
  - Survey generation goals: comprehensive field coverage, capturing land use, vegetation, landscape features, and boundaries to support ground-truthing of satellite-derived land cover maps.

- Equipment and field tools
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, and project handouts provided by Merlewood; additional equipment supplied by local ITE Stations; surveyors provide personal gear.
  - Standard field gear supports mapping, plotting, and on-site data capture (e.g., survey poles, marking plates, measuring tapes, cameras, field guides).

- General field survey procedure
  - On arrival: perform quick area scan, assess access and potential problems, and plan a route enabling full square coverage.
  - Permissions: obtain permission to access all parts of the square; contact landowners/farmers to establish arrangements and background information; record ownership and contact details on the FAB.
  - Data integrity: complete surveys with careful checks for omissions and clear presentation; guide decisions in the field rather than deferring to post-processing.

- Permissions and land access
  - Rationale: legal access, courtesy and background information from farmers/landowners; avoidance of conflicts and data gaps.
  - Procedure: prior letters to known landowners; site visits to confirm arrangements; carry ITE publication for distribution; maintain clear identity (ITE card) and ownership/tenant notes.
  - Contingencies:
    - If access is refused entirely, abandon the square and replace; if partial access is possible, continue with the accessible parts.
    - If vegetation access is refused, note and reposition according to guidelines in Section 6.2 and related procedures.

- Data recording framework (Filling in the FAB)
  - Core elements: three components—mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (with sampling details in Section 7).
  - Mapping and coding: annotate 1:10,000 maps with a structured set of primary and secondary codes; use alpha Codes to compress multi-code information; ensure boundary types are clearly delineated; minimum mapping units and boundary delineation rules apply.
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) structure: pages contain components for series number, location, ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland water, coastal features, vegetation cover types, forestry/woodland, boundaries, buildings/structures/communications, verge and road features, and universal codes.
  - Data quality and presentation: FABs should be neat, legible, and interpretable; quantify cover with 5% bands; document any uncertainties or changes.

- Mapping, API, and data capture details
  - Mapping: large 1:10,000 maps; use data codes to annotate features; combine multiple primary codes to reflect complex mosaics; ensure linkage between codes (e.g., dominant use first).
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API): supplement ground data by identifying non-map features (isolated trees, boundary changes); use dashed lines for APIs and crosses for isolated features; ignore conflicts where ground evidence overrides API.
  - FAB completion guidance: ensure series numbers and locations are consistently recorded; provide ownership details with owner/tenant indicators; capture farmer conversations and background information on the land if possible.

- Vegetation and plot-based sampling (6.2)
  - Plot philosophy: standardised vegetation sampling across multiple plot types to support consistent cross-square comparisons.
  - Plot types and layout:
    - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 quadrats per square; nested inner 4 m2 quadrats within each large quadrat; permanent metal marker plates for relocation.
    - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m quadrats placed in natural or semi-natural land cover types, distinct from large quadrats.
    - Linear plots: up to five per square for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides; layout designed to maximise representation of land cover types and linear features.
  - Location and relocation: relocation rules for 1978-era plots; if hedgerows/streams have changed, move plots to nearest permissible location while preserving square integrity; record all movements and rationales.
  - Recording and measurement:
    - Species identification: note 200 common species; use a restricted list with combinations when precise IDs are difficult; record unlisted species as needed.
    - Cover estimation: record plant cover in 5% classes; account for multi-layered covers (e.g., moss over grass); note dominant and mosaic areas with primary and secondary codes.
    - Bryophytes and lichens: specific lists maintained; only a subset of bryophytes/lichens are recorded in FABs.
    - Permanent markers and sketch mapping: photograph plots; sketch plot layout with distances and bearings; location plates placed outside the plot boundary for relocation.

- Vegetation data standards and codes
  - Codes: a comprehensive set of land cover, species, boundary, and habitat codes (primary and secondary) used to describe vegetation, land use, and landscape features.
  - Species and habitat conventions: detailed species lists and groupings for crops, grasses, forbs, woody plants, mosses, and lichens; use limit-based combinations when necessary for ambiguous identifications.
  - Boundary and boundary-type coding: detailed descriptors for hedges, fences, walls, banks, verges, and boundaries, including conditions (stockproof, trimmed, derelict, etc.) and lengths.
  - Data integrity practices: universal coding system (e.g., 888 new map codes; 999 no longer on map) to support longitudinal comparisons and updates.

- Freshwater sampling (7)
  - Freshwater biota: two samples per square from standing and flowing waters; collection managed by external programs (IFE and NELUP).
  - Field protocol: mark sampling sites on the map; use sieves and formalin-preserved bottles; document sample details including date, surveyor, and tray description; transport back to Merlewood promptly.
  - Habitat coverage: sampling targets reflect two characteristic water habitats per square (e.g., lakes/ponds, ditches, flushes, bogs, etc.).

- Photography and post-survey procedures
  - Photography: print film documentation of each vegetation plot; include plot numbers and location references in photographs; ensure edge placement and marker visibility.

- Procedural safeguards and post-survey steps
  - End-of-day checks: review FABs for omissions; avoid reworking maps unless damage necessitates it.
  - Sample handling: arrange timely transport of FABs and samples to ITE stations.
  - Data accessibility and metadata: ensure datasets are discoverable, accompanied by metadata, and primed for sharing or archiving.

- Data quality challenges and analyst considerations
  - Key challenges for analysts: lack of data at right local scales; data stored in disparate formats (journals, local authority data, reports); access barriers and registration friction; observer variation affecting statistical accuracy; integration of multi-source data with non-standardised formats.
  - Opportunities for analysis: time-series assessments across 1978, 1984, 1988, and 1990; linking ground-truth vegetation and land-cover data with satellite-derived maps; modeling ecological change and landscape patterning; standardized metadata and clear documentation to support reproducible analyses.
  - Limitations and caveats: minimum mappable areas and lengths; field-based identification limitations; the need for expert domain interpretation for certain categories; reliance on field observers for coding fidelity.

- Documentation and provenance
  - Core reference: Colin Barr, with 1990 revision (February 1991); background information and contacts available through ITE and Merlewood Research Station.
  - Data lifecycle emphasis: maintenance of source documentation, mapping provenance, and clear, machine-readable metadata to enable discoverability and reusability of surveyed datasets.
