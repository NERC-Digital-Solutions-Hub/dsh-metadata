# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1

## Aim and scope
- Countryside Survey estimates of Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1990 and 1998 (CS90_98_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map).
- National estimates of Broad Habitat percentage change (Habitats 1-17) calculated using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Outputs are summarized by ITE Land Class (LC2007) with mapping methodology described in Barr (1998) and Barr (1991).

## Data sources and classification
- Data: Countryside Survey (CS) data from 1990 and 1998; Countryside Survey © NERC – Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Classification: 2007 ITE Land Classification (LC2007) based on Bunce et al. 1996; Bunce et al. 1981; Bunce et al. 2007.
- Output: CS90_98_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp (shapefile) detailing changes by Broad Habitat.
