# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose: Assess consistency and reliability of CS2000 field work across 38 of 519 squares, via resurvey of 234 species plots (nine plot types) to measure QA indicators such as plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, and accuracy of land-use mapping and changes.
- Context: Acknowledges inherent variation from many recorders; QA aims to quantify accuracy of field recording and change statistics, and relate findings to previous CS1990 QA.

## Aims and scope

- Quantify field-recording accuracy for CS2000 and comment on change statistics.
- Examine plot relocation efficiency and reasons for any differences (observer error, plot location, management/seasonal effects).
- Relate findings to CS1990 QA results and assess mapping accuracy and change recording.

## Methods and scope

- Sample: 38 of 519 squares; one quarter rerecorded per square; 234 plots across 9 plot types (quadrats and linear plots: road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, hedge-related plots, etc.).
- Relocation assessment: attempted relocation of buried plates; comparison of CS2000 relocation with 1990/1991 QA precedents; categorised relocation outcomes from fully found to not found.
- Data comparison: parallel field surveys (CS2000 vs QA assessors) for species lists, cover estimates, land cover codes, boundary features, hedge/wall conditions, and changes since 1990.

## Key findings: plot relocation and plate recovery

- Plot relocation success: about 60% accurately relocated, ~25% relocated to an acceptable degree, ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate recovery: assessors located 69.3% of plates; total recovery capacity estimated around 40–45% by CS2000 teams, with some instances of misplacement or incorrect side of features.
- Relocation consistency: eight years on, relocation feasibility comparable to 12 months post-burial in earlier QA; some relocation errors persisted (e.g., wrong bank/side of a hedge or stream).

## Key findings: species concordance and recording accuracy

- Overall recording accuracy: CS2000 initial records matched QA at 71% (presence confirmed by QA), with about 2% non-concordances due to management/seasonal changes.
- Compared to 1990 CS, CS2000 QA showed similar efficiency after accounting for plot relocation issues; mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4 (increase of QA listings).
- Across plot types, the QA frequently produced longer species lists; changes in mean species numbers over time were similar to previous QA cycles.
- Allocation of variation (TI vs T2): dominant mis-matches due to overlooked species (roughly 14–40% depending on plot type), with other errors from mis-identifications, wrong box-ticking, orientation, or location errors. Management- and season-related changes also contributed to mismatches.

## Key findings: vegetation cover and abundance

- Cover estimates: comparisons of main species show mixed agreement; some species exhibited significant differences in cover between CS2000 and QA (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Eriophorum vaginatum), others showed no significant differences.
- Overall cover concordance for the principal species across plots: ~74% agreement; several common grasses showed higher disagreement, though several grasses (Lolium perenne, Agrostis species) showed relatively closer agreement.
- Species-specific cover codes: overall concordance for species-cover codes ~74.4%, with a tendency for surveyors to give higher cover codes than QA assessors in many cases, though the direction varied by species.

## Key findings: change in frequency and ordination

- Frequent changes in apparent species composition were observed at the level of individual plots; within-plot changes were assessed using DECORANA ordination (Axis 1).
- For plot types, most axis-score shifts were not strongly biased in direction; when aggregating, there was no evidence of a directional bias between CS2000 and QA.
- No single dominant cause for discrepancies emerged; issues included location/orientation errors, cover mis-matches, and overlooked species, with some changes due to management/season.

## Key findings: land-use mapping and boundary features

- Primary land cover codes: overall concordance between CS2000 and QA was high (87.5% when excluding BAP codes); primary code concordance ~88%, with BAP codes somewhat lower (~77%).
- BAP (broad habitat) codes: lower concordance due to broader, more complex habitat distinctions and boundary misclassifications.
- Land-use primary qualifying codes: concordance ~73–81% depending on metric; overall primary land-use qualifying code concordance ~73.1%.
- Boundary features: primary boundary codes showed very high concordance (~92%); overall boundary feature coding (e.g., hedge/wall condition) showed substantial agreement (~67.5%), with omissions contributing to mis-match.
- Boundary height and stockproof status: high concordance for boundary height (≈89%), stockproof status (≈83–89%), indicating reliable field coding for boundary attributes.

## Key findings: hedge diversity and boundary coding nuances

- Hedge diversity plots (H plots): overall total species count and the assessors’ larger total species count indicated notable overlooked species; 124 total species recorded across hedge plots, with 74.2% overall agreement and 77.4% surveyor efficiency.
- Boundary shape and hedge codes: new hedge shape codes had limited success; many hedges fell into code 374 (box-shaped hedge), with some mis-matches between hedge-type codes and reality (e.g., post-and-wire boundaries vs hedges).

## Key findings: arable plots

- Very limited data (only five arable plots); concordance was extremely poor, likely reflecting seasonal differences and less familiarity with ruderal arable species.
- High variability due to seasonality and difficulty identifying ruderal species; recommendation: consider multiple visits for arable margins in future work.

## Change recording and overall data quality

- Change recording: overall change concurrence was about 51.4%; a substantial portion of changes noted by CS2000 were not substantiated by QA (33.9%), and some changes observed by QA were not noted by CS2000 (14.7%).
- Many changes may reflect differences in interpretation, mis-codings, or omitted changes, suggesting cautious interpretation of long-term change using CS2000 data alone.
- Conclusion: While CS2000 data provide valuable information, the QA indicates notable opportunities to improve change recording accuracy and consistency across time.

## Mapping and data product implications

- Mapping accuracy is generally robust for primary land cover and boundary features, supporting reliable geographic data products and change detection.
- Some mismatches (especially BAPs, hedges, and hedge shapes) highlight areas for improved coding schemes or training.
- The QA underscores the importance of considering plot relocation, accurate plot overlap, and seasonality when comparing multi-time datasets.
- For data support tasks, outputs should be shared and reused, with attention to documentation of uncertainties and potential biases arising from plot relocation, mis-location/orientation, and change interpretation.

## Overall conclusions relevant to data support

- CS2000 field work demonstrates strong consistency in land-cover mapping and boundary coding, with high concordance against QA assessments.
- Notable challenges remain in plot relocation accuracy, change detection concordance, and arable margins; these areas require improved procedures or repeated measures to enhance reliability.
- The QA results reinforce the value of rigorous QA processes to understand data quality, inform data products, and guide improvements for future data collection and integration into dashboards, reports, and decision-support tools.
