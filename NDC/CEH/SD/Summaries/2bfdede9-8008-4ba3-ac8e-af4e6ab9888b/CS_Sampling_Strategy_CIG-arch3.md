# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the evolution of the sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification used to underpin Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 through 2007.
- Emphasises the aim of producing representative, policy-relevant habitat and land-use estimates by using a stratified sampling approach tied to environmental land classifications.
- Explains how changes in classification and country-specific reporting requirements influenced sample design and size over time.

## The Beginning: stratified, representative sampling
- Early work introduced a stratified sampling system to ensure samples represented different land types and ecological conditions.
- Stratification reduces bias from purely random sampling by ensuring all parts of the population (land types) are represented in the sample.
- The ITE Land Classification provides the theoretical basis for creating strata that reflect differences in altitude, geology, climate, land use, and other environmental attributes.
- A 1 km square was chosen as the standard sample unit, balancing field practicality with the need for environmental differentiation.

## Development of the first ITE Land Classification (1978)
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to group 1 km squares into 32 land classes based on environmental variables.
- Sample framework: select the centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid (1228 centres) and classify the centre plus four surrounding squares, yielding 6039 km squares classified.
- Survey design: eight 1 km squares per land class were surveyed (total of 256 squares) during the field season.
- Estimation approach: national habitat areas derived by multiplying the mean habitat area per square by the land-class area, enabling extrapolation from class-level data to GB-wide estimates.
- The 32 land classes were described by various environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, slope, rainfall) and mapped (Figure 1).

## Countryside Survey 1984: land use focus and expanded sampling
- Focus shifted from soils and plant species to land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping.
- Sampling framework remained the same, but total squares per survey increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (including eight previously visited).
- This increased sample size improved national estimates for land-use and habitat mapping (examples published in Barr et al., 1986).

## Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990): all-squares Land Classification
- Initiated to meet policy and scientific needs, linked to the first Land Cover Map (derived from satellite imagery).
- Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB squares; some squares were reclassified.
- Field survey selected 508 squares; all features from 1984 survey were recorded, plus a repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats.
- Results and methodology published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report (CS1990 vol.2).

## Developments of the ITE Land Classification: transitioning to nationwide coverage
- Recognized need to classify every square in GB, not just the sample, for regional and local estimates.
- With limited computing power, a surrogate-based approach was used to classify every square, using climatic, geological, and physiographic surrogates.
- The reclassification produced only 62% exact correspondence with the original 1228-class scheme; most changes fell into neighboring classes and did not alter class characteristics.
- The reclassification affected the distribution of samples across land classes, prompting discussion of representativeness and comparability.

## Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000): separate country estimates and enhanced Welsh reporting
- Goals included producing separate reliable estimates for England with Wales and for Scotland, acknowledging policy needs and devolution.
- Adjustments:
  - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit variants (England & Wales, Scotland).
  - Aggregation of rare country-specific sub-classes to maintain adequate sample sizes (creating 40 strata from 32).
  - Additional squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes in each country unit (minimum six squares per new class; extra allocation to balance England and Wales).
  - Wales-specific refinement of Land Class 17 to improve Wales reporting.
  - Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates and replaced by new England samples.
- An uplands module added to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales, funded separately.
- Summary tables and figures (e.g., Figure 5) illustrate the sample distribution and country-specific design changes.

## Developments for Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting and Welsh-class subdivisions
- Wales-only reporting requirements led to further refinement of the sampling framework for Wales.
- Welsh-only estimates:
  - Land Classes subdivided into five Wales-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w.
  - Total strata increased to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional sample squares to ensure adequate representation across Welsh classes (minimum six squares per Welsh class).
  - England retained two classes (5e, 15e) with four squares each due to minimal precision loss deemed acceptable by the scoping study.
- England, Scotland, and Wales maps (Figure 6) and sample-square distributions (Figure 7) updated to reflect the CS2007 framework.
- Table 3 provides the numbers of sample squares per class for CS2007 and shows total samples by country and the sampling rate (1:x).
- The approach aimed to balance precision across countries while meeting Wales-specific reporting needs.

## Note on national estimates and classification consistency
- The 2006 scoping study notes that switching to the latest Land Classification for national estimates affects consistency of stock estimates.
- For internal survey consistency, the latest classification is preferred; for cross-survey consistency, the original 1990 scheme may be used.
- Table 4 contrasts sample sizes per class under the original 1990 Land Classification across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.

## Outputs, governance, and governance implications for monitoring frameworks
- The sampling strategy supports robust, policy-relevant environmental monitoring by:
  - Maintaining stratified, representative sampling across land classes and country units.
  - Adapting to changing policy needs (country-specific reporting, Wales-only data, upland habitats).
  - Documenting changes in classification and sampling design to preserve interpretability of time-series data.
- Data and metadata implications:
  - Changes in Land Classification require careful metadata management to ensure traceability and comparability over time.
  - The approach underscores the importance of transparent reporting on sampling fractions, class definitions, and country-unit delineations for governance and data reuse.
