# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Guides CS2000 countryside survey planning, field data collection, mapping, and change detection to update land-use and landscape datasets, monitor environmental change, and support policy-oriented evaluation.
- Provides standardised methods to generate current, consistent environmental health measures and to link ground-truth field data with policy frameworks (e.g., biodiversity action plans, sustainable development indicators).

## Core concepts and monitoring framework design

- Two-tiered change-focused mapping:
  - Mappable Broad Habitats (enclosed/lowland landscapes)
  - Plottable Broad Habitats (upland/unenclosed landscapes)
- Time-series emphasis:
  - Re-survey existing 1 km squares to maintain continuity
  - Supplement with additional squares to represent new classes and country units
- Plot-based vegetation sampling:
  - Hierarchical plots (Areal, Y, U, B, S/W, R/V, H, D, A) to capture habitat diversity, boundary dynamics, and water/roadside vegetation
- Data capture and governance:
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FAB) and standardized forms
  - Integration with CS1990 codes and biodiversity frameworks; flexible coding for novel features
  - Emphasis on standardised observer recording and quality control
  - Documentation of permissions, ownership, and access for compliance and engagement
  - Transparent, well-structured outputs to support data sharing and governance
- Stakeholders and use:
  - Outputs aimed at government departments, NGOs, and research bodies
  - Framework supports linking field change signals with remote sensing and national reporting requirements

## Data quality, access, and governance challenges

- Data gaps and metadata quality issues in existing datasets
- Organizational silos and data accessibility barriers
- Public sharing of underlying data can hinder use of existing datasets
- Keeping data up to date and ensuring governance/standards at data origin

## Section 10 – Sampling

- Three sampling types in CS2000:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff)
- Background and purpose:
  - Address need for soil quality indices and baseline data to support soil sustainability monitoring
  - National, spatially referenced soil samples collected in the same squares as the 1978 survey
- Soil sampling details:
  - Five replicate samples per square for soil chemistry, soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status
  - Samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing and storage
  - Sampling uses three cores per set (long and two short pipes) and a defined center-plot protocol
  - Rapid processing of short-life samples; longer-term handling for chemistry samples
  - Equipment distribution managed by regional co-ordinators
  - Detailed field procedures for locating sampling points, extracting soil cores, labeling, bagging, and posting
- Calluna sampling:
  - Collect CYG (current year growth) Calluna vulgaris shoots (30–50 g fresh weight)
  - Randomly sample from multiple plants, label, package, and despatch to ITE Merlewood
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Coordinated with IFE; integrated timing with field survey activities
- Equipment and logistics:
  - Specified items distributed per team; standardized packaging (envelopes, bags, pipes) aligned with square and plot numbers

## Section 11 – Photography

- One camera per team; film stock provided; additional films claimed via T&S forms
- Photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and reference features
- Reference features must be obvious, permanent, and identifiable; include square and plot numbers on a board visible in the shot
- Composition guidelines to ensure plots and features are clearly depicted; minimize excessive sky in frames
- Examples and instructions provided during Field Training Course

## Section 12 – Procedures after survey

- Post-survey data checks:
  - Read data sheets to ensure no features are omitted
  - Transposition of data to fresh maps/forms discouraged unless necessary
- Return logistics:
  - FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE stations promptly

## Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data

- Battery and satellite readiness:
  - Ensure external power, sufficient satellites (minimum four), and low PDOP for accurate fixes
- Recording stationary vs moving features:
  - Stationary: record plot locations; moving: record along boundaries
- File naming:
  - Create explicit file names combining square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE); include features with reference codes (e.g., 501F1.MOB)
- Data logging and descriptor setup:
  - Set sampling rate (1 second) and assign plot/feature names
- GPS operation tips:
  - Start/stop logging via on-screen prompts
  - Maintain a clear sky view; allow 3–5 minutes of recording for plots; longer if obstructed
- Almanac and PDOP guidance:
  - If needed, allow solar/almanac updates; aim for PDOP < 6 for better accuracy
- Output and input aids:
  - Use attribute reference lists and quick-input schemes to select plot IDs and features efficiently

## Key outcomes for monitoring framework authors

- A reproducible, scalable field framework for countryside monitoring across time, space, and land-use types
- Standardised data collection procedures linking ground data with remote sensing and national reporting
- Clear guidance on sampling, data capture, GPS metadata, photography, and post-survey processing
- Structured governance and data-handling practices to improve transparency and data usefulness for policy evaluation and decision-making
