# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Purpose: Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey, explain observer/seasonal/location differences, relate findings to previous QA work, and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.
- Context: Acknowledges inherent variation from many recorders; QA focuses on consistency, reliability, and how data quality affects ecological conclusions and change statistics.

## Methods

- Two QA series conducted:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares; relied on original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Added photographs of individual plots and provided a single 1 km square from each of 32 terrain classes; included self-assessment squares.
- Plot types (six): 200 m2 X-plots; 4 m2 Y-plots; 1 × 0.1 km2 roadverges; hedges; streamsides; boundaries; etc. Each quarter of a square resurveyed to include all plot types present in the square.
- Plate relocation: Assessed how accurately buried plates marking quadrats could be relocated (autumn 1990 and 1991 trials); classification of performance into three categories (relocated; found, but not satisfactorily relocated; not found with insufficient information).
- Data collection: Landcover and boundary features recorded at nine predetermined points within the quarter; standard Countryside Survey 1990 procedures used; photographs and sketches used to aid relocation.
- Data quality measures: Species concordance indices (four defined: % agreement, Agreement, Concordance, % accuracy); initial efficiency of recording (% accuracy); analysis by plot type and landclass; DECORANA ordination to assess ecological gradient shifts.

## Key Findings

- Plot relocation and plate findings:
  - Autumn 1990 plate/plot relocation recovery around 71%; 1991 recovery around 65% for plates and 87% for plots.
  - Three performance categories: (i) plate and plot relocated; (ii) plate not found but location deemed adequate for relocation; (iii) plate not found with insufficient information.
- Species recording and changes:
  - Initial survey versus QA: mean species per plot increased in 1991 QA vs 1990 original (overall 20.7 to 23.4; highly significant in pooled data, p ≈ 0.009).
  - Across plots, the 1990 QA showed ~45–60% percent agreement depending on calculation method; after adjustments for seasonal differences, overall agreement around 60.9%.
  - Seasonal/annual effects: drought year (1990) vs more normal 1991 year; upland plots less affected by seasonal change; drought contributed to apparent under-recording in 1990.
  - Net effect: a real increase in species per plot in 1991 growing season, with some portion attributable to actual ecological change and portion to improved recording efficiency.
- Plot-type and landclass effects:
  - Differences in accuracy across landclass aggregates: UP (uplands) showed distinct vegetation and relocation challenges; lowland arable (LC) exhibited comparatively lower recording accuracy.
  - X plots easier to relocate; Y plots difficult; plate-based relocation improved with photography but small Y plots remained challenging.
- Mapping and landuse codes:
  - Primary landuse codes generally reliable (high concordance, often > 88%); boundaries coding more variable (~80–83% depending on comparison).
  - Some codes caused systematic mis-matches (e.g., marsh codes, certain upland moorland vs blanket codes); recommendations to refine and subdivide certain upland codes.
  - Inter-assessor consistency: mapping codes showed strong agreement between assessors and across time ( autumn vs summer QA ), indicating good overall reproducibility but with interpretive variation in some boundary and descriptive codes.
- Cover estimates and vegetation mapping:
  - Cover estimates at nine points per square show substantial concordance for dominant species but far lower for co-dominants; typical concordance for dominant species around 81%, dropping for co-dominants to about 34%.
  - Overall, mapping of vegetation cover was generally faithful to the dominant components but less reliable for detailed species-level co-dominance patterns.
- Longitudinal ecological gradient:
  - DECORANA first-axis scores suggested directional shifts consistent with known land-use changes and with prior ECOLUC findings; 1990–1991 changes paralleled 1978–1988 trends in lowlands, with some year-to-year perturbations in marginal areas due to drought/seasonality.
- Species groups:
  - Frequency analyses of conservative groups across plot types largely showed no significant difference between 1990 original surveys and 1991 QA; some individual species did show year-to-year changes due to climate or sampling.

## Sources of Variation and Recommendations

- Major sources of variation:
  - Misidentifications and species overlooked at T1 (original survey).
  - Seasonal/annual changes in species presence and abundance.
  - Plot mis-location and orientation errors, particularly for smaller plots (e.g., Y plots).
  - Management-related changes (e.g., crop changes, herbicide use) affecting species composition.
- Specific recommendations:
  - R1: Retain lichens in general surveys, with enhanced training samples and habitat information for familiarization.
  - R2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the time of the original survey.
  - R3: Use photographs to re-establish exact plot positions; annotate photos with ground features; ensure proper relation between photos and sketches.
  - R4–R5: Improve ground-truthing for small plots (X, Y); use plate markers where possible; for Y plots adopt standardized positioning with ground-based references.
  - R6–R7: Update training to emphasize distinguishing similar grasses and bryophytes; ensure bryophytes are adequately recorded where relevant to vegetation classifications.
  - R8–R10: Subdivide and clarify land-use and land-cover codes (e.g., upland grassland classifications; wet heath; rush pasture) to reduce ambiguity; restrict boundary codes to hedges and clearly define their species composition with qualifying codes.
  - R11–R12: Simplify and stabilize mapping codes to reduce interpretive variation; map only the most prevalent species for vegetation units; provide simpler dichotomous tools for land-use coding; emphasize robust primary codes and clearer boundary descriptors.

## Mapping, Documentation, and Annex Insights

- Primary land-use codes: high concordance across assessments and QA; minor categories less well tested due to limited frequency.
- Boundary codes: good overall agreement but some confusion between similar hedge/stockproof/cover-related codes; recommend tighter boundary coding rules and more explicit qualifying codes.
- Species cover: dominant species show strong cross-time concordance; co-dominants and low-abundance species show substantial variability; recommendations to focus cover mapping on dominant species for reproducibility.
- Photographic relocation: photographs greatly aid relocation, especially in unenclosed land; annotated photographs with surrounding features significantly improve accuracy and efficiency.

## Conclusions for Future Surveys

- Photographs are essential aids for plot relocation; distance and bearing information should accompany sketches.
- Metal plates for X-plots assisted relocation, but upland unenclosed areas remain time-consuming; consider additional staffing for relocation in these areas.
- Y-plots require improved quadrat positioning methods and better localization aids via photographs and ground features.
- Species identification generally strong, but grasses and bryophytes require targeted training; consider expanding allowable bryophytes for certain habitat surveys.
- QA should occur in the same season/year as the original survey to minimize climate-driven differences; restrict QA to the same season and year where feasible.
- Land-use mapping should employ more codes and dichotomous choices to enable clearer, more reproducible mapping; reduce emphasis on individual-species cover in mapping outputs to enhance reproducibility.
- Overall, the 1990 QA demonstrates substantial reliability of major mapping and vegetation assessment components, while highlighting specific, actionable areas for methodological refinement to improve future survey accuracy and consistency.
