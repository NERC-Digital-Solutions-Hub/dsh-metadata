# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview

- Purpose: to measure consistency and reliability of the CS2000 field programme across a substantial sample, focusing on plot relocation, species recording, vegetation cover estimates, landcover mapping, and change detection.
- Scope: QA on 38 of 519 squares surveyed in 1998; in each square one quarter resurveyed, involving 234 species plots across nine plot types.
- Aims addressed: accuracy of field recording; efficiency of plot relocation; observer bias vs. plot/season effects; comparability with CS1990; landuse and boundary mapping accuracy; recording of habitat change.

## Methods and Scope

- Sampling design: one quarter of each selected square resurveyed; 234 plots distributed across plot types (quadrats, linear plots, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, etc.).
- Relocation and marking: plots marked by buried plates; relocation attempted eight years after initial burial; use of sketch maps, photographs, and metal detector to locate plots and plates.
- Timeframe and data: comparison between CS2000 field records (TI) and QA assessments (T2); Annex B lists dates and efficiency metrics; Annex A/B describe procedures for mapping and coding.
- Data types evaluated: species lists, percent cover for principal species, landcover codes (primary, secondary, cover, boundary-related), hedge diversity, and changes recorded since 1990.
- Change assessment: analysis of differences in landuse codes and vegetation between the original CS2000 survey and QA reassessment, with particular attention to whether changes were real or due to recording errors.

## Key QA Findings

- Plot relocation
  - Of 210 plots with full searches, 86.7% could be satisfactorily relocated; 60% of CS2000 plots were relocated exactly, ~25% relocated with some accuracy, ~15% not adequately relocated; small Y plots hardest to relocate (23% failure).
  - Assessors recovered 69.3% of plates; CS1990 QA recovery was 65.2%; overall, eight-year relocation is feasible but not always exact; some instances of mis-location or mis-orientation occurred.
  - Implication: relocation accuracy influences subsequent species and cover data, highlighting the need for durable marking and precise recording protocols.

- Species concordance and recording accuracy
  - Mean species per plot increased from CS2000 to QA (CS2000 ≈ 17.9; QA ≈ 20.4); agreement across all plots about 87–89%, with some variability by landclass and plot type.
  - Of roughly 6000 CS2000 records examined in 210 QA plots, about 71% were confirmed present by assessors at resurvey; ~2% attributed to real management/seasonal changes between surveys; initial recording accuracy around 73%, slightly lower than CS1990 (≈78%), largely due to plot relocation issues.
  - Change in species composition across plots detected, but mis-matches were common and often tied to mis-location/orientation and identification errors; overall, seasonality and management changes contributed to discontinuities.

- Vegetation cover estimates
  - Visual cover estimates for >5% cover were generally repeatable, but several species showed significant differences between CS2000 and QA (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Eriophorum vaginatum) with some p-values indicating statistical differences.
  - Across several featured species, QA often yielded longer species lists and modestly different cover amounts; some species showed substantial discrepancies, while others (e.g., Lolium perenne) were more consistent.
  - Overall, cover concordance across landuse points was around 63%; discrepancies tended to stem from mis-location/orientation and different cover-band assignments rather than outright misidentification.

- Landcover and boundary coding
  - Primary landcover codes: high concordance; overall primary landcover agreement ≈ 87.5% (excluding BAP); BAP (broad habitat) codes ≈ 77.4%.
  - Landcover change coding and boundary-related codes: primary boundary codes showed strong concordance (~92% code concordance; total boundary concordance ≈ 85%); boundary shape/hedge codes had moderate concordance (~67.5%); some systematic differences occurred in wall/hedge classifications.
  - Change in landuse codes: overall concordance for change was 51.4%, with 33.9% of changes not noted by CS2000 and 14.7% changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors; many changes since 1990 appeared to be missed, indicating challenges in reliably cataloguing change.

- Hedge diversity and arable plots
  - Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
  - Arable margin plots (5 plots): poor concordance (≈30.6%); seasonality and unfamiliarity with ruderal species likely contributed; recommendation for two well-spaced visits to future arable margin plots.

- Overall changes in frequency of prevalent species
  - Across plot types, rankings of common species were broadly similar between CS2000 and QA, but many discrepancies existed; reporting biases included under- or over-recording of certain grasses and forbs, mis-identifications, and mis-location/orientation effects.

- Annexed methodological notes
  - QA used a structured protocol for mapping land cover and boundaries, a standardized coding scheme, and a time-aligned approach to assess change; data are linked to TI and T2 values for cross-time comparisons.

## Implications for Data Stewardship

- Data quality and reliability
  - While overall agreement levels are high for many data elements (e.g., landcover codes, boundary codes), substantial mis-match rates remain for plot relocation, species identification, cover estimation, and change recording.
  - The reliability of change detection is limited by inconsistent recording practices and the difficulty of distinguishing true ecological change from measurement error.

- Data provenance and metadata
  - Provenance needs explicit documentation of survey date, QA date, plot type, landclass, and who performed relocation and QA assessments.
  - Metadata should capture potential biases (seasonality, observer differences, plot location/orientation errors) and the exact coding schemes used (primary/secondary landcover codes, BAP categories, hedge/wall codes).

- Data models and coding
  - High concordance in primary landcover coding suggests stability of core codes, but ongoing issues with hedgerow/wall boundary codes indicate a need for clearer guidelines and possibly updated code definitions.
  - Differences in cover-coded data indicate a need for standardized training and explicit criteria for assigning cover bands, particularly for grasses and mosaics.

- Data governance and update processes
  - Given the observed changes since 1990 and the frequency of missed changes, establish robust change-detection workflows, with explicit criteria for when a change is considered real vs. recording artifact.
  - Ensure versioning of datasets and traceable change histories; document any re-coding or re-interpretation of past plots.

- Accessibility and usability
  - Provide both TI and T2 datasets with accompanying QA metrics, including per-plot reliability indicators (location accuracy, orientation, cover concordance) to enable end-users to assess uncertainty.
  - Publish methodological annexes and code mappings to facilitate reproducibility and transparent comparisons over time.

## Recommendations

- Strengthen field protocols
  - Improve permanence and visibility of plot markers; minimize loss or disturbance of location markers; standardize relocation procedures to reduce mis-location/orientation.
  - Consider adding more robust digital tools (GPS-enabled plotting, digitized sketch maps) to improve location accuracy and traceability.

- Enhance training and taxonomic rigor
  - Provide targeted training on identification of frequently confused grasses and weeds; reinforce consistent use of taxonomic references and code-sets.

- Improve data coding and quality checks
  - Update and standardize landcover/hedge/wall coding rules; implement automated checks to flag unlikely or conflicting codes (e.g., boundary vs. adjacent feature).
  - Introduce explicit QA checks for change entries, with cross-validation against earlier strings to reduce omissions and spurious changes.

- Increase QA coverage where warranted
  - For arable margins and other data-poor plot types, implement multiple visits across seasons to reduce seasonal bias and improve capture of transient species.

- Documentation and version control
  - Maintain clear data dictionaries, codebooks, and change logs; ensure end-users understand TI/T2 relationships, QA status, and limitations of the data.

- Integrate QA insights into governance
  - Use QA findings to inform data collection protocols, training curricula, field equipment choices (plates, markers, mapping tools), and data ingestion pipelines with explicit uncertainty reporting.
