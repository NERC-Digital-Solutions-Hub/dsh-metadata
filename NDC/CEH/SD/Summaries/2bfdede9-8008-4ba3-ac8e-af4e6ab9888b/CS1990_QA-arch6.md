# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- A comprehensive evaluation of the quality and reliability of vegetation and land-use data collected during the 1990 Countryside Survey, with aims to quantify recording accuracy, explain sources of error, relate findings to previous work, and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.

## What the document is about (beginning)

- Recognises inherent variation in field surveys due to many recorders and observers, despite training and supervision.
- Seeks to measure consistency and reliability across major field components, techniques, and recording tasks used in the survey.
- Builds on earlier QA exercises (1988 partial survey, 1989 and 1990 QA work) to assess observer error, seasonal effects, plot relocation, and data quality.

## What was done (methods and data collection)

- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 of the original survey squares assessed; used original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Expanded QA with photographs of individual plots; single 1 km square from each of 32 terrain classes; included self-assessment of some squares.
- Sampling design:
  - Each 1 km square divided so that a quarter includes one of each plot type represented in the full square.
  - Six plot types across two quadrat sizes and linear features:
    - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X-plots) and 4 m2 (Y-plots)
    - Linear plots: road verges, hedges along streams, etc., plus boundary features
  - Burial of corner plates for relocation of quadrats; verification of landcover and features at nine fixed points per quarter.
- Relocation and verification:
  - Plots relocated using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detector locating of corner plates.
  - In 1991, relocation also tested with plot plates, photographs, and regrouped squares.
- Data and measures:
  - Species lists and cover values recorded per plot; multiple comparison indices to assess concordance:
    - Percentage agreement, stricter agreement, general agreement, and % accuracy (to factor out seasonal/annual variation).
  - Additional analysis of errors sources (mis-identifications, overlooked species, over-zealous recording, mis-location/orientation, seasonality, management changes, etc.).
- Data products for evaluation:
  - Land-use codes (primary and secondary), boundary classifications, and vegetation cover data at a nine-point grid per quarter.
  - DECORANA ordination to examine ecological gradients and axis shifts between survey periods.
- Reference points for context:
  - 1990 vs 1991 comparisons, and comparisons to earlier work (1978-1988 trends).

## Key findings (middle)

- Overall data concordance and species recording:
  - Full 1990 QA showed an overall species-list concordance (percentage agreement) of about 60.9%, which was higher than earlier partial estimates (around 45%).
  - In 1991 QA, mean species per plot increased (All plots: 20.7 in 1990 to 23.4 in 1991; by landclass and plot type varied), with a significant improvement in recording efficiency when seasonal/annual effects were considered (p = 0.009 for the overall change).
  - Analyses indicate that about 27% of the observed increase in species per plot from 1990 to 1991 was due to greater efficiency of recording, while about 73% reflected real changes in species composition (likely influenced by climate/season and drought differences).
- Plot relocation and plate-marking:
  - Plate relocation success varied by plot type and time:
    - Autumn 1990: 71% recovery rate for plates within 5 minutes (66 plates across 32 plots in two assessors).
    - 1991: 65% plate relocation success and 87% plot relocation success when including the use of photographs and plate information.
  - Some plot types (notably Y-plots) were much harder to relocate accurately.
- Sources of error and their relative contributions:
  - A substantial portion of variation was attributed to misidentifications and mis-codings (T1 errors) and to mis-location/orientation errors (I2 errors) rather than true ecological change.
  - Seasonal and annual variation (weather/season) contributed substantially to observed differences; drought year 1990 versus more normal 1991 influenced species presence/absence and detectability.
  - Under-recording in the original 1990 survey was evident, especially for certain species in drought years, with an uplift in 1991 largely representing both genuine ecological change and improved detection.
- Plot types and landclass differences:
  - DECORANA analyses indicated a gradient (axis 1) separating shade-tolerant vs. shade-intolerant species, with upland plots showing stronger differentiation.
  - Landclass effects were significant: upland (UP) differed from lowland groups; lowland arable (LC) showed lower recording accuracy, possibly due to higher species diversity and rapid changes in arable habitats.
  - Overall, LC and MA (marginal) classes showed lower accuracy than LG (lowland grassland) and UP tended to be more tricky to relocate but more stable in some respects.
- Mapping land use and vegetation:
  - Primary land-use codes were highly reliable, with concordance around 88–95% for common codes across lowland and upland squares.
  - Boundary codes had slightly lower concordance (~80%), with improvement when the same assessors re-surveyed the same squares; interpretation and coding depth influenced results.
  - A substantial portion of variance in land-use coding remained due to ambiguous or insufficiently defined codes (e.g., marsh, upland grassland vs. moorland/shrub heath), prompting recommendations for code refinement.
- Cover estimates:
  - Visual cover estimates for species present at both surveys showed limited concordance for some species; for example, 81% concordance for the first species at a point, but much lower for co-dominants (around 34%).
  - The study concluded that cover data were more variable and should be simplified to focus on the most prevalent species to improve reproducibility.
- Species groups and broad trends:
  - Analyses of groups of representative species showed no significant change in the cumulative frequency between 1990 and 1991 for the six plotted groups, though some individual species did show changes likely due to weather or ecological shifts.
- Overall ecological interpretation:
  - The first axis shifts in DECORANA across 1978-1991 and the 1990-1991 QA period suggested broad ecological trends consistent with prior ECOLUC findings, though year-to-year variability was evident, particularly in marginal and arable lands.
- Practical conclusions about QA and field-work:
  - Photographs are crucial for relocation accuracy, especially in unenclosed lands.
  - Distances and compass bearings should be recorded consistently on sketches; photographs should be annotated for location context.
  - Metal plates were effective for pin-pointing X plots but are time-intensive in upland areas; scaling labor and resources may be required for larger or more remote areas.
  - The Y plots (4 m2) are particularly challenging to position; improved strategies (e.g., ground-truthing, ground-based markers) recommended.
  - Introduction of more explicit bryophyte and lesser-known-species guidance is warranted for future QA and national vegetation classification work.
  - Seasonal/year alignment is critical: QA should be conducted in the same year and season as the original survey to minimize seasonal bias.
  - Mapping codes should be simplified and expanded thoughtfully to reduce ambiguity; emphasis on two most prevalent species for vegetation mapping is advised to improve reproducibility.
  - Training should focus on distinguishing grasses and related taxa, particularly in moisture- and nutrient-gradient habitats; better bryophyte coverage and habitat-specific species lists should be integrated into field handbooks and training.

## Recommendations (key takeaways for future work)

- Recommendation 1: Retain and train on lichens (and other key taxa) with habitat information; include species samples in training.
- Recommendation 2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the original survey date to minimize seasonal and annual variation effects.
- Recommendation 3: Ensure surveyors annotate photographs and link them to plots; record distances to nearby features and use consistent ground-truthing with photos.
- Recommendation 4: Use metal marker plates to mark X plots in enclosed land where feasible.
- Recommendation 5: Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with a survey tape, orient so the side (not diagonal) is aligned N–S, and place at the SE corner; improve orientation accuracy.
- Recommendation 6: Photographs and relocalization methods should be standardized and used to re-establish exact plot positions.
- Recommendation 7: Improve guidance on relocating very small plots (Y plots) and ensure photographs show delineated ground with nearby distinguishing features.
- Recommendation 8: Subdivide upland ground-cover codes (102) into subcategories (e.g., upland improved meadow/pasture vs upland grassland) and refine moorland/bog partitions; improve marsh/bog classifications.
- Recommendation 9: Add a dedicated lowland rush pasture code to distinguish rush-dominated systems.
- Recommendation 10: Recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type and assign a primary code to reflect its unique status.
- Recommendation 11: Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge categorization and cover hedge species composition with qualifying codes to reduce misclassification.
- Recommendation 12: For mapping vegetation cover, focus on the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit to improve reproducibility; reduce reliance on fine-grained cover codes where not essential for analysis.
- Additional guidance: Increase the repertoire of primary land-use codes and provide simple, dichotomous keys for field recording to reduce ambiguity; emphasize bryophyte recording where relevant to habitat classification; align QA with habitat-specific needs and ensure robust data pipelines for future National Vegetation Classification-related work.

## Implications for data use and data products

- Data quality metrics and QA outputs can be used to adjust confidence in plant lists, cover estimates, and land-use mappings for subsequent analyses, reports, and dashboards.
- The QA framework provides actionable guidance for data governance: clear coding schemes, standardized location metadata, and robust photographic documentation to accompany field data.
- The findings support developing streamlined data products with:
  - More reliable primary land-use codes and simplified boundary coding schemas.
  - A focused set of prevalent species per plot for mapping and monitoring.
  - Documentation and templates for plot relocation, photographic annotation, and field-notes alignment to ensure reproducibility.

## Conclusion (end)

- Photographic documentation, precise plot localization, and consistent coding are central to improving data quality in vegetation surveys.
- The 1990 Countryside Survey QA, with its 1990 and 1991 analyses, demonstrates substantial real ecological changes across years, but also highlights the significant influence of observer effects, seasonal variation, and plot relocation accuracy on data quality.
- The report provides detailed recommendations to enhance future surveys, including refined coding systems, better field training on taxa, improved relocation methods (especially for small plots), and ensuring QA is year- and season-aligned with the main survey.
