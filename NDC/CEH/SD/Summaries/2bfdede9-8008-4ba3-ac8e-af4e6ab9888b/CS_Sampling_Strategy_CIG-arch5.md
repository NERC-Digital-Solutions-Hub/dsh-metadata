# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the field sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007, the latest in the ITE Land Classification-based framework developed over 30 years.
- Emphasizes the need for representative, stratified sampling and a documented, repeatable methodology to support long-term time-series analysis of Britain's countryside.

## Land Classification and Sampling Framework
- ITE Land Classification: classifies land into discrete environmental strata using factors like altitude, geology, climate, and other environmental attributes.
- Sampling unit: 1 km squares across Great Britain; originally central squares of a 15 × 15 km grid used for classification.
- Initial approach (CS1978): stratified, random sampling across 32 land classes; 8 samples per class (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas by class proportions.
- Data products: national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within a class multiplied by the class area (i.e., area-based extrapolation).
- Early data collection emphasized vegetation quadrats and soils, with habitat mapping.

## Evolution by Survey Year
- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - 32 land classes; 1 km squares as units; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class).
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representation of each class.
- 1984 – Second Field Survey
  - Increased sample size: 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Focus shifted toward land use and habitat mapping alongside ecological features.
- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification; Countryside Survey 1990
  - Revision to classify every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; updated methodology for regional relevance.
  - Resulted in substantial changes to class assignments (only about 62% correspondence with the prior classification).
- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Need for country-specific estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland); introduction of separate country unit estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating 40 strata) with some aggregation where representation was low.
  - 19 additional squares added to ensure adequate representation across new classes; upland habitat module added with 30 extra upland squares for England & Wales.
- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting necessitated Wales-specific class subdivisions and more Welsh samples.
  - New Welsh sub-classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), increasing strata to 45.
  - 43 additional Welsh squares added; two English classes (5e, 15e) left with 4 squares each.
  - England and Wales sampling adjusted to maintain comparable precision; upland module retained and expanded as needed.
  - Country maps and tables updated to reflect revised classifications and sample allocations.

## Country Units and Upland Module
- Separate country estimates introduced to better meet England & Wales vs Scotland policy needs.
- Wales-specific adjustments included targeted Welsh class sub-divisions and additional Welsh samples.
- Upland module (CS2000 onward) added to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales (30 extra squares).

## Data Governance and Stewardship Implications
- Versioned classifications: Maintain clear links between each survey year and the Land Classification version used, since changes affect comparability.
- Metadata and data lineage: Capture survey year, country unit, class version, sample square identifiers, and the sampling rate for reproducibility.
- Crosswalks and mapping: Document mappings between old and new land classes to support cross-survey comparability.
- Separate data repositories: Store country-unit datasets (England & Wales; Scotland; Wales) with appropriate metadata and access controls.
- Documentation of changes: Record rationale for adding squares, subdividing classes, and adjusting sampling rates to support future audits and governance needs.
- Data quality and comparability: Acknowledge that classification changes can affect national estimates; prefer within-survey latest classifications for consistency, while cross-survey comparisons may require harmonization.
- Data sharing and licensing: Ensure maps, tables, figures (e.g., land-class maps and sampling maps) are accessible under appropriate licenses and linked to their methodological context.

## Challenges and Considerations
- Incomplete or evolving user needs vs. data availability: Ensuring the sampling framework remains fit for policy-relevant reporting (e.g., Wales-only, upland habitats).
- Inter-system/interoperability: Handling multiple classifications and country-specific subdivisions across surveys in a maintainable way.
- Representation bias: Earlier surveys faced under-representation in some classes; ongoing refinements aimed to stabilize representation across country units.
- Large-scale data management: Managing growing datasets, classifications, and extensive documentation across multiple years and jurisdictions.
