COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

Overview and Purpose
- Purpose: monitor changes in land use, vegetation, and landscape to assess environmental health and policy performance over time; provide current, comparable datasets for scientific evaluation.
- Approach: two-tier integration of bottom-up field data with satellite imagery and remote sensing; standardized data collection using the ITE Land Classification System.
- Outputs: clear, consistent datasets and outputs (maps, reports, charts) suitable for scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance; datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.

Survey Design and Scope
- GB-wide survey with 512 sites (squares) targeted for resurvey in 1990.
- Six ITE Research Stations coordinate teams; each square typically assigned to one of six station teams (~85 squares per team).
- Fieldwork plan: each square expected to require about three survey days; flexible scheduling to manage time and access; travel-based arrangements with no overtime payments (time off in lieu for large overtime).
- Replacement and permissions: if access is refused for parts of a square, procedures for replacement or partial surveying are followed; prior farmer/landowner contact encouraged.

Data Collection, Tools and Standards
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB): the central data collection instrument combining mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; used with 1:10,000 aerial maps and site photographs.
- Equipment: FABs, aerial photographs, base maps, mapping sheets, field handouts, weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, marker plates, sampling tools, measuring tape, navigation gear, and farmer/ownership sheets.
- Data integrity: emphasis on standardization to minimize observer variation; quality control and field handbooks to ensure consistency across observers and years.

Field Procedures and Permissions
- On-site workflow: arrive, assess site, obtain permission for full access where possible, select routes that enable full square examination, and review the record for omissions after surveying.
- Permissions and stakeholder engagement: letters sent to farmers/landowners; in-square permissions logged and updated; if access is denied, predefined procedures determine how to proceed or replace the square; prioritize contacting owners/tenants directly.
- Documentation of ownership: ownership and contact details recorded on FAB, with a system to rate cooperation levels and note changes in ownership since 1984.

Mapping, Recording and Coding (FAB)
- Mapping: the most geographically comprehensive element; all features annotated on enlarged 6" maps (1:10,000) using a set of primary and secondary codes; alpha codes used to condense long code strings while preserving detail.
- Codes and conventions: use of alpha codes (A, B, etc.) to represent combinations of numeric codes; all features must have at least one primary code; boundaries clearly delineated; minimum mappable area 1/25 ha; minimum length 20 m.
- Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API): optional support to identify features not on OS maps (e.g., isolated trees, boundary shifts); dashed lines and crosses used to indicate API-identified features; decisions should be grounded in ground truth.
- Filling the FAB: each FAB page requires the square series number, ownership details, and careful mapping of vegetation, boundaries, and land use; use of colours and notes for complex mosaics; where necessary, take photographs and add sketches for clarity.

Plotting and Habitat Sampling (6.2)
- General approach: standard vegetation sampling using plots and quadrats, with semi-natural and agricultural habitats documented using a hierarchy of codes.
- Plot types (per square):
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots (to map vegetation composition and cover).
  - Small quadrats: five 2x2 m plots within each square to sample more detailed vegetation structure.
  - Linear plots: up to five plots for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides to capture linear habitat variation.
  - Boundary plots: placed adjacent to large quadrats to capture boundary vegetation.
  - Boundary rules: relocation rules defined if hedgerows or streams change; if a boundary is not present, plots relocate to a suitable alternative feature.
- Location, relocation and permanence: permanent markers (metal plates) placed for locating quadrats; photos and sketches used to document the position; quadrats occasionally placed on field boundaries or adjacent to features with distances measured from a fixed reference point.
- Recording vegetation: nested quadrats within each plot record species presence and percent cover in 5% bands; a standardized list of about 200 common species (herbs, grasses, bryophytes) plus a space for unlisted species; include bryophytes and lichens for specialist recording.
- Species identification: field identifications use standardized groupings where exact species-level ID is challenging; predefined acceptable species combinations are permitted to maintain consistency across surveys.
- Hemispheric and boundary mapping: includes trees, hedgerows, walls, fences, banks, verges, tracks, and derived boundary features; careful attention to edge effects and mosaic vegetation.

Vegetation Sampling Details (6.2.2–6.2.5)
- Plot layouts: large 200 m2 quadrats with nested 4 m2 and smaller plots; five 200 m2 plots per square plus five 2x2 m plots in natural/semi-natural land cover types; linear, boundary and road verge plots follow strict layout rules to preserve comparability with earlier surveys (1977/78, 1988).
- Plot layout and measurement: diagonals oriented north/south and east/west; permanent markers placed just outside the plot; detailed sketches and photographs to document plot geometry and surrounding features.
- 1978 rules for locating linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) provide standard placement guidelines to ensure comparability across survey years.
- Vegetation data collection: all vascular plants recorded; a restricted list of bryophytes and lichens included; UNLISTED species documented and nested-quadrat approach used to capture species richness; cover estimated in bands; caution about potential over- or under-estimation and cross-checks between observers.

Forestry, Boundaries and Built Features (6.x)
- Forestry/woodland codes: woodland units described using woodland codes; no features from other FAB pages recorded within woodlands unless the unit exceeds the minimum mappable area; trees, scrub and their age class, canopy cover, and management status documented.
- Boundaries and walls: recording of dry-stone walls, hedgerows (dominant species, age, management), fences, banks, verges, and other boundary types; emphasis on stockproofness, gaps, and signs of changes or removal.
- Buildings/structures/communications: urban/rural built features coded (buildings, roads, car parks, quarries, etc.) with detailed descriptors and color coding to facilitate interpretation.

Sampling of Freshwater Biota (7)
- Freshwater sampling: two main streams per square – freshwater biota sampling by Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) and NERC/ESRC Land Use Programme (NELUP) at Newcastle University, focusing on water beetles.
- Location and labeling: sample points clearly mapped to the same map used for IFE; NELUP sites described succinctly; samples collected with sieve, preserved in formalin, labeled with square, date, and surveyor; transport to Merlewood for processing.

Photography and Documentation (8)
- Photography: print film used to photograph each vegetation plot; a visible plot number board placed at the plot edge to document location and aid relocation; photographs support interpretation of vegetation and landscape context.

Procedures Subsequ ent Survey (9)
- End-of-day checks: review FABs to ensure completeness; avoid post-hoc transcription unless necessary due to map or form damage; arrange prompt return of FABs and samples to ITE stations for processing.

Key Challenges and Considerations for Analysts
- Value enhancement: integrate field monitoring with other data sources to create richer, multi-layer datasets for environmental monitoring.
- Data accessibility: ensure underlying data are accessible to others to enable broader analysis and reuse.
- Standardization and QA: ongoing emphasis on inter-observer consistency, documented field procedures, and robust data management to support reliable temporal comparisons.

Notes for Analysts
- The document lays out a comprehensive, standardized framework for long-term environmental monitoring, combining rigorous field sampling with detailed mapping, coding systems, and reproducible procedures designed to support trend analysis and policy evaluation across decades.
