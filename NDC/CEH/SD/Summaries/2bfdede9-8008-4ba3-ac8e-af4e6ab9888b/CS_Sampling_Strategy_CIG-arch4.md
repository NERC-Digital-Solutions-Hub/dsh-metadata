# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year development of the ITE Land Classification.
  - Emphasizes the importance of understanding the evolution of sampling design to interpret time-series data.

- Core concepts
  - ITE Land Classification: a stratified environmental stratification system for Great Britain, used to ensure representative sampling across diverse landscapes.
  - Stratified random sampling: samples are allocated across land classes (strata) to minimize bias and capture ecological variability.
  - Survey units: initially 1 km squares; sampling in a central square plus four surrounding squares for classification robustness.

- Historical evolution of the sampling framework
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
    - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 central 1 km squares.
    - Sampling: 8 squares per class (total 256) across GB; habitat area estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class.
  - 1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (384 total); eight previously visited squares retained.
    - Continued use of the 32-class framework; results published with landscape-change insights.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify all 1 km squares in GB; satellite-derived Land Cover Map linked to the programme.
    - 508 squares surveyed; added repeat of 1978 quadrats; some squares reclassified due to the expanded dataset.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification & Fourth Field Survey)
    - GB-wide land classification expanded to better support Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
    - Resulted in re-estimation approaches for national stock estimates; updated methodology for regional estimates.
  - 2000 (Revised Land Classification & Fifth Field Survey)
    - Introduction of separate country estimates (England & Wales vs. Scotland) to reflect policy and governance needs.
    - Land classes subdivided by country units; 40 strata formed; additional squares added to ensure representation; upland habitats module introduced to improve upland estimates.
  - 2007 (Further Developments for Wales-Only Reporting & Sixth Field Survey)
    - Wales-only reporting necessitated Wales-specific adjustments: new Welsh sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
    - Additional Welsh squares (43) implemented; England adjustments limited (some classes still with four squares).
    - Wales received enhanced sampling to support country-specific estimates; updated country maps and sampling framework.

- Country-specific and upland considerations
  - Separate country estimates
    - Framework subdivided land classes into country-unit versions; aggregated rump classes within each country when necessary.
    - Adjusted sampling to ensure minimum representation in each class per country.
  - Wales upland module (CS2000)
    - Added 30 upland/marginal upland squares to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.

- Design implications and notes for data leaders
  - Changing classifications affect cross-survey comparability; two main approaches exist for national estimates (latest country-specific classification vs. original 1990 classification).
  - National estimates must consider shifts in class definitions when aggregating across survey years.
  - The framework balances statistical rigor (stratification by land class) with practical constraints (survey effort, country-specific reporting, upland emphasis).
