# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1

## Overview
- Dataset provides national estimates of Broad Habitat area change (increase/decrease) between 1990 and 1998 for Great Britain.
- Derived from Countryside Survey data using the 2007 ITE Land Classification; delivered as CS90_98_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp.
- Source: Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology; all uses must acknowledge the data.

## Data contents and structure
- National estimates are summarized by Broad Habitat type (Habitats 1–17) and by LC2007 (ITE Land Class 2007).
- Mapping methodology and references described in associated literature.
- Columns include:
  - LC2007 (number) – ITE Land Class (Bunce et al., 1996; 1981; 2007)
  - LC2007_COD (text) – Land Class description
  - Survey Years (text) – Years of survey (to/from)
  - Column1 (Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland) – % change
  - Column2 (Coniferous Woodland) – % change
  - Column3 (Boundary and Linear Features) – % change
  - Column4 (Arable and Horticulture) – % change
  - Column5 (Improved Grassland) – % change
  - Column6 (Neutral Grassland) – % change
  - Column7 (Calcareous Grassland) – % change
  - Column8 (Acid Grassland) – % change
  - Column9 (Bracken) – % change
  - Column10 (Dwarf Shrub Heath) – % change
  - Column11 (Fen, Marsh, Swamp) – % change
  - Column12 (Bog) – % change
  - Column13 (Standing Open Waters and Canals) – % change
  - Column14 (Rivers and Streams) – % change
  - Column15 (Montane) – % change
  - Column16 (Inland Rock) – % change
  - Column17 (Urban) – % change
- Each column indicates the percentage area change for that habitat type.

## Data provenance and methodology

## Governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure metadata clearly documents time period, spatial units (1km squares), and the LC2007 classification linkage.
- Maintain and enforce the required acknowledgement in all outputs; track citations to the referenced publications.
- Monitor for updates or reclassifications (e.g., new Land Classification revisions) and plan for interoperability with other habitat datasets.
- Be mindful of licensing constraints and preserve provenance through citations and proper attribution.
