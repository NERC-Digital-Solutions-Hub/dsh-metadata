# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Purpose and scope
- Establish standardized field survey methods for CS2000, aligning soil, Calluna, and freshwater sampling with reporting and data quality goals.
- Coordinate collection, processing, and storage of data and samples to support national baselines (e.g., soil quality indices) and Calluna nitrogen analyses.
- Integrate field data with vegetation, habitat, and remote-sensing-derived information; emphasize reproducibility and time-series comparability.

## Sampling types and aims
- Soil sampling: five replicate soil samples per 1 km square, analyzed for pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals, soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status; samples processed at ITE Merlewood.
- Calluna sampling: within each square containing Calluna vulgaris, collect current year’s growth (CYG) shoots for nitrogen deposition analysis; random selection across plants; 30–50 g fresh weight per sample.
- Freshwater sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff, coordinated with field teams.

## Soil sampling protocol
- In each X-plot center, collect three soil cores from five center plots per square (total of five sampling locations per square).
- Sampling points located 15 cm N, 15 cm E, and 15 cm W of the center plot corner; use long black pipe (15 cm) and two white pipes (8 cm) for core collection.
- Cores are bagged, labeled, and posted or collected for transport; samples designated for rapid processing when necessary.
- Post-sampling, keep samples cool and ensure prompt dispatch to ITE Merlewood; record any special notes (e.g., obstacle roots).

## Calluna sampling
- For squares with Calluna vulgaris, follow a standardized protocol to obtain CYG shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from randomly selected plants.
- Label, bag, and seal samples, then dispatch to ITE Merlewood; ensure timely shipping and keep a record of the square and sampling event.

## Freshwater sampling
- Managed by IFE staff; sampling occurs concurrently with CS2000 field activities; coordination with CS2000 coordinators to schedule timing.

## Equipment distribution
- Some items marked with an asterisk (*) or hash (#) are distributed to each team or per square allocation.
- Standard equipment includes: cool box, trowel, long blade knife, measuring tape, lump hammer, aluminium plate.
- Packets and packaging: large plastic bags, padded SAE envelopes to ITE Merlewood, multiple sets of pipes and end caps, and spare envelopes and bags.
- Detailed packing instructions accompany envelopes to ensure correct square and plot tracking.

## Field procedures and data capture
- Field data are captured on Field Assessment Books (FABs) with standardized headers and species lists; data cover presence/absence, nested plots, and 5% cover categories.
- For soils and Calluna, follow explicit stepwise procedures (center plot location, 15 cm offsets, core collection, labeling, packaging, and dispatch).
- Document any anomalies or deviations at the time of collection (e.g., root obstructions, unusual vegetation).

## Documentation and photography
- Each vegetation plot is photographed using a camera (one per team) with initial film stock; photographs should capture general appearance and reference features.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and clearly visible; photos must include square and plot numbers on a board placed at the plot edge.
- Photos should fill an appropriate portion of the frame and avoid excessive sky; examples of proper/ improper compositions are provided.

## GPS data collection
- Annex 1 provides step-by-step GPS guidance: battery checks, satellite count, PDOP targets (<6 for 3D fixes), logging stationary vs moving features, and file naming conventions.
- File naming: create unique names combining square number and plot/feature id (e.g., 501X4.PSE); include feature type when recording new features (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
- Data logging and plotting: ensure a clear sky view for 3–5 minutes per plot; use Magellan keypad shortcuts for quick entry; store GPS data with proper metadata for relocation.

## Data quality, training, and reproducibility
- Emphasize standardized field recording to minimize observer differences; comprehensive training on field handbook usage and data entry is essential for reliable time-series analysis.
- Documentation and metadata practices are designed to make datasets discoverable and usable across time and observers.

## Data management, codes, and parcel management
- Field data use standardized codes and BAP alignments to ensure consistent recording across time and observers.
- Parcel numbering and linking between map features and data forms are used to track changes; new parcels may be created when features change type, area, or boundary.
- Attribute reference systems and quick-entry sheets help researchers rapidly locate plot identifiers and associated observation codes.

## Post-survey procedures
- After each survey day, review data sheets to ensure no feature is omitted; avoid unnecessary re-entry of data unless necessary due to damage.
- Arrange for transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly to maintain chain-of-custody and data integrity.

## Annexes and references
- Annexes provide detailed GPS data collection guidance and attribute reference materials to support rapid data entry and standardization across teams.
- The document emphasizes integration of field data with broader CS2000 goals, including change detection, standardization, and linkages to remote sensing and time-series analyses.
