# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1

## Overview
- An output from Countryside Survey describing national changes in Broad Habitat areas in Great Britain between 1990 and 1998.
- Uses the 2007 ITE Land Classification to summarize change by Land Class; methodology described in Barr (1998) and Barr (1991).
- Based on Countryside Survey data and 1 km survey squares; references Bunce et al. and Scott provide the supporting methodologies.
- Dataset file: CS90_98_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp.

## Data content and structure
- Geographic format: Shapefile detailing broad habitat change estimates.
- Columns:
  - LC2007 (number): ITE Land Class (Bunce et al. 1996; 1981; 2007).
  - LC2007_COD (text): Land Class code.
  - SURVEY (text): Years of survey (to/from).
  - Column1 (number): % change in Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland.
  - Column2 (number): % change in Coniferous Woodland.
  - Column3 (number): % change in Boundary and Linear Features.
  - Column4 (number): % change in Arable and Horticulture.
  - Column5 (number): % change in Improved Grassland.
  - Column6 (number): % change in Neutral Grassland.
  - Column7 (number): % change in Calcareous Grassland.
  - Column8 (number): % change in Acid Grassland.
  - Column9 (number): % change in Bracken.
  - Column10 (number): % change in Dwarf Shrub Heath.
  - Column11 (number): % change in Fen, Marsh, Swamp.
  - Column12 (number): % change in Bog.
  - Column13 (number): % change in Standing Open Waters and Canals.
  - Column14 (number): % change in Rivers and Streams.
  - Column15 (number): % change in Montane.
  - Column16 (number): % change in Inland Rock.
  - Column17 (number): % change in Urban.
- Each ColumnN represents the percentage increase or decrease in the area of the corresponding Broad Habitat.

## Methodology and scope
- National estimates of Broad Habitat change are calculated for 1990–1998.
- Change estimates are derived using the 2007 ITE Land Classification framework.
- Land Classification mapping and methodology described in related technical resources:
  - ITE Land Classification of Great Britain 2007 (Bunce et al. 2007).
  - Countryside Survey statistical background (Scott 2007; CS Technical Report No. 4/07).
  - Countryside Survey habitat mapping methodologies (Barr 1998; Barr 1991).
- Data is designed to enable cross-habitat comparison by Land Class and to facilitate historical trend analysis.
