# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Introduction and Core Concepts
- The field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) has evolved over three decades and is tied to the ITE Land Classification.
- Purpose: to stratify the landscape into homogeneous units (strata) and select representative samples to detect change and estimate habitat features across Great Britain.
- Key methodological idea: use stratified random sampling to avoid bias and ensure samples cover ecological variation across land types and regions.
- Early foundation: classification and sampling developed from 1 km squares, using environmental attributes to define land classes.

## The ITE Land Classification and Stratified Sampling
- Land Classification: a multivariate system that groups land into classes (land types) based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.), enabling environmental stratification for sampling.
- Sampling logic: allocate samples within each land class (strata) to capture within-class variability and enable national and regional estimates.
- Early approach used the centre square of a 15 × 15 km grid across GB; surrounding squares were classified to extend the classification footprint.
- Over time, the classification was refined to better reflect regional and country-specific reporting needs (e.g., Scotland, Wales).

## Timeline of Developments

- 1978 CS (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - ISA-based classification produced 32 land classes from environmental data.
  - Sampling: 1 km squares centered within classes; eight samples per class (256 total).
  - National estimates derived by combining average habitat area per square with class land area.

- 1984 CS (Second Field Survey)
  - Sampling expanded: 12 squares per land class (384 total).
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.

- 1990 CS (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify all 1 km squares in GB; urban and sea corrections applied.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repetition of 1978 vegetation quadrats; inclusion of Land Cover Map from satellite imagery.
  - For national estimates, the revised (1990) classification was later used; some squares changed class.

- 1998 CS (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
  - Land Classification updated to enable separate Scotland reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
  - 569 squares surveyed; national estimates adjusted to reflect the revised classification.

- 2000 CS (CS2000; 5th Field Survey)
  - Addressed policy needs for separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland).
  - Sub-division of classes into country-unit versions; expanded strata to 40.
  - Additional samples added to ensure adequate representation of new classes (including upland considerations).
  - Isle of Man samples replaced to align with country-unit reporting.
  - Upland module introduced to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.

- 2007 CS (CS2007; 6th Field Survey)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further Wales-specific adjustments.
  - New country-unit class subdivisions created (five new Wales/England-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure representation of new Welsh classes.
  - Some English classes reduced to four squares per class; upland sampling maintained.
  - England, Wales, and Scotland sample maps updated to reflect revised framework.

## Sampling Framework and Numbers

- CS2007: detailed class-by-class sampling adjustments; overall expansion to enable Wales- and England-specific reporting.
- Welsh adjustments: 43 additional Welsh squares; minimum six squares per Welsh class; dedicated sub-classes for Wales.
- English adjustments: some classes with four squares per class due to Welsh additions; overall precision deemed acceptable per scoping studies.
- Upland module: added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland areas (England and Wales) to improve habitat estimates in upland regions.

## Separate Country Estimates and Wales/Uplands

- Country-unit framework: Land Classes subdivided into England-with-Wales and Scotland versions to enable country-specific estimates.
- Aggregation and sub-division: to maintain adequate representation across countries, some classes were re-grouped within each country.
- Isle of Man: removed from country-unit estimates; two GB squares replaced with two England squares for country reporting.
- Wales-specific reporting: Wales required additional Welsh-class subdivisions and more Welsh samples to ensure Wales-only estimates were robust.

## Uplands Module

- An additional surveying module (CS2000 and CS2007 contexts) placed 30 squares in uplands and marginal uplands to refine habitat estimates in upland areas, acknowledging their distinct ecological characteristics.

## Data Use and National Estimates

- Changing land classifications across CS surveys affects the consistency of national estimates; cross-survey comparisons must consider classification changes.
- Preference for using the latest Land Classification for country-specific reporting, while original classifications are used for cross-survey consistency in other contexts.
- National estimates historically calculated by combining mean habitat area per square within each land class with the total land class area; later surveys aligned estimates to updated classifications and country units.
- Summary tables (e.g., Table 4) illustrate how sample sizes per class changed across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 under the Original (1990) Land Classification, highlighting the impact of reclassification on comparability.
