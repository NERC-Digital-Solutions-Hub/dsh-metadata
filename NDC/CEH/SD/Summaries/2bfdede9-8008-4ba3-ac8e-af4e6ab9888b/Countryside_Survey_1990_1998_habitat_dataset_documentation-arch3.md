# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1 Version: 1: 10-12-2014 Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology

- Purpose: Provides national estimates of Broad Habitat percentage change (for 17 habitat types) between 1990 and 1998, derived from Countryside Survey data and summarized by the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Data product: CS90_98_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp, with mapping methodology described in foundational Land Classification work.

## Data and methods

- Scope and basis
  - National estimates of percentage increase or decrease in Broad Habitat area (Habitats 1–17) for 1990–1998.
  - Uses the 2007 ITE Land Classification (ITE Land Classification 2007) to assign habitat classes.
  - National figures are generated from the Countryside Survey data and summarized by Land Class.
- Methodological references
  - Mapping methodology described in Barr (1998; 1991).
  - ITE Land Classification 2007 vector dataset described in Bunce et al. (1996; 1981; 2007) and associated technical reports.
  - Statistical linkage: CS 2007 results and how national estimates are derived from 1 km survey squares (Scott, 2007; CS Technical Report No. 4/07).
- Data structure (columns)
  - LC2007 (numeric): ITE Land Class (Bunce et al. 1996; 1981; 2007).
  - LC2007_COD (text): ITE Land Class code/name.
  - Survey (text): Years of survey (to/from).

    - Column1: Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland
    - Column2: Coniferous Woodland
    - Column3: Boundary and Linear Features
    - Column4: Arable and Horticulture
    - Column5: Improved Grassland

    - Column11: Fen, Marsh, Swamp
    - Column12: Bog
    - Column13: Standing Open Waters and Canals
    - Column14: Rivers and Streams
    - Column15: Montane
    - Column16: Inland Rock
    - Column17: Urban

- Accessibility and governance
  - Dataset is accompanied by methodological documentation and a robust set of references.
  - Publication and data dissemination practices are framed around transparent methodologies and attribution.

## Data governance and usage considerations for monitoring frameworks

- Data quality and metadata
  - Historical time frame (1990–1998) may limit applicability for real-time monitoring; important to pair with more current datasets for trend analysis.
  - Metadata completeness is essential to verify classification alignment (ITE Land Classification 2007; Barr methodologies cited).
- Data access and sharing
  - Data usage requires explicit acknowledgement; governance should ensure consistent attribution in all outputs.
  - Source data are derived from multiple publications and datasets; traceability via the provided references is important for auditability.
- Data integration and harmonization
  - Aligns 17 Broad Habitat classes with the 2007 ITE Land Classification framework; when applying within a broader monitoring framework, consider harmonizing with newer land classifications or more recent Countryside Survey rounds.
  - Transformation steps (e.g., from 1 km survey squares to national estimates) should be documented for reproducibility.
- Stakeholder and governance implications
  - Rich referencing provides a clear chain of evidence; use in policy evaluation should cite the primary CS and Land Classification sources.
  - The need for methodological clarity ( Barr 1998/1991; Scott 2007) supports transparency in how habitat change is estimated and interpreted.

## Relevance for policy evaluation and monitoring

- Provides a standardized, nationally scoped measure of habitat area change across multiple Broad Habitat types, enabling:
  - Baseline establishment for long-term environmental health monitoring.
  - Assessment of policy impacts on habitat extent during the 1990s baseline period.
  - Comparative analyses across Land Classes to identify where changes are most pronounced.
- Supports reporting through maps and tables that summarize change by habitat class and land-use context.
