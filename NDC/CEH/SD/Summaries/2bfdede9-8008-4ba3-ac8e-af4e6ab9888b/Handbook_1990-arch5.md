# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

- Purpose and scope
  - Update and monitor land cover, vegetation, and landscape features to support ecological assessment and modelling.
  - Build on prior ITE surveys (1977/78 and 1984) with a resurvey in 1990 and enhanced data capture, including satellite-derived information.
  - Large-scale design: 512 site squares surveyed by six ITE stations, using a combination of ground survey and remote sensing to enable ground-truthing and pattern detection.

- Data governance and quality focus
  - Emphasis on standardised field recording to minimise observer variation; thorough quality control and a Field Handbook as a prerequisite.
  - All data collected are documented in Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and linked to maps, aerial photographs, and site metadata.
  - Permanent plot markers and relocation protocols are defined to enable future re-location and longitudinal comparison.
  - Detailed ownership/permission records and farmer/landowner interactions are documented to ensure legal access and enable background context.

- Study design and planning
  - Squares grouped into six regional teams; each team manages about 85 squares.
  - Each square expected to require roughly three survey days; flexible scheduling to accommodate access and travel constraints.
  - Travel time considerations and cost control; multiple planning options (local daily travel, short-term away, or longer blocks with weekends).

- Equipment and provisioning
  - Merlewood-provided: FABs, aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, project explanations, weatherproof clipboards, pens, survey poles, marker plates, sampling gear, measuring tape, navigation tools, ID cards.
  - Local stations provide maps, additional tools; surveyors provide personal gear.
  - Emphasis on robust, transportable equipment suitable for diverse field conditions.

- General field procedures
  - On-site assessment to anticipate problems and obtain access permission for the full square.
  - Selection of a route that allows comprehensive coverage; after recording, review for omissions and clarity.
  - If permissions are refused partially or fully, predefined contingency steps are followed to either continue recording what is accessible or replace the square.

- Data recording and FAB documentation
  - The Countryside Survey 1990 relies on three elements: mapping, quadrat recording, and sampling (with sampling detailed in Section 7).
  - FABs must be completed neatly; key fields include square number, ownership, farmer information, physio-graphic and habitat data, land use, vegetation and species codes, boundary and buildings, and descriptive notes.
  - Codes are primarily alpha-numeric; a two-tier coding system (primary and secondary codes) is used to annotate features on 6" maps (1:10,000). Codes must be applied in a logical order (e.g., a cover code followed by a species code).
  - When a feature is no longer present on the ground, mark with code 999; use field notes to explain changes.
  - Ownership and contact details: document owner/tenant details, and rate cooperative potential for future surveys (0–3 scale).
  - Special instructions for field conditions (e.g., use of color coding when multiple codes are needed; indicate qualitative notes for complex mosaics).

- Mapping and coding (6.1)
  - Mapping (HAPPING) is the primary, geography-wide element: annotate large-scale maps with a suite of data codes; use combinations of data codes to capture multiple attributes per feature.
  - Alpha codes (A, B, etc.) compress long code sequences, with a defined rule to avoid confusion (uppercase letters only; avoid X and 0; use I as I, not 1).
  - Two code types: primary (essential) and secondary (additional). Prefer a single dominant primary code per unit; when multiple dominate, place dominant code first.
  - Boundaries must be clearly marked on maps; if a boundary has ceased to exist, code 999 indicates “no longer present.”
  - Minimum mappable unit and length: 1/25 ha and 20 m respectively; use a cross (X) for point information.
  - API (Aerial Photograph Interpretation) provides guidance for identifying non-map features, semi-natural vegetation boundaries, and updates (e.g., new buildings). API markings are guidance and subordinate to ground-truthing.

- Filling in the Field Assessment Booklet (FAB)
  - FABs are the integrated record: complete for each square, with a consistent page order (though not strictly fixed).
  - Required entries: square number on every page; neat, legible recording; map units should be delineated by distinct descriptive codes; use a pencil when possible for water-resistance and revision.
  - Sector-specific pages: ownership, farmer information, physiography/inland water/coastal, land use, vegetation, forestry/woodland, boundaries, buildings/structures/communications, descriptions.
  - For vegetation, a predefined list of ~200 common species is used; if unidentified, collect samples; record cover in 5% increments; mosaic areas may require multiple codes.
  - Appendix material includes universal species lists, bryophyte/lichen lists for limited sampling, and a standardized approach to recording species combinations when identification is uncertain.

- Plot types and vegetation sampling (6.2.2–6.2.5)
  - General vegetation sampling approach uses standardized plot types and nested sampling to capture mosaics and changes over time.
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 quadrats per square placed to sample major land-cover types; quadrat placement prioritises representative habitat “center of gravity.”
  - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m quadrats placed in five different semi-natural or natural land-cover types not already represented by large quadrats.
  - Linear plots: up to five linear plots for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides (1 m wide) located adjacent to the primary features; permanent marking with plates is required.
  - Boundary, hedgerow, stream, and roadside plots each have specific placement rules relative to dominant vertical features to ensure consistency and comparability with prior surveys.
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots are retained as a baseline; documentation allows relocation if features have changed but ensures at least one plot per water/linear type per square.

- Vegetation recording methodology
  - Two levels of data collection: plot-level and nested subplots; the inner nested quadrat is analyzed first, followed by larger nested areas; final cover estimates are aggregated for the 200 m2 quadrat.
  - Species lists: record vascular plants, a restricted bryophyte/lichen list, and any unlisted species with notes; herbaceous and woody species are tracked with specified coding.
  - Data quality: strict rules guide species identification, with acceptable species combinations for difficult taxa to maintain consistency with historical datasets.
  - Permanent markers: metal plates or field-bound markers are used to re-locate quadrats in future surveys; precise documentation of marker positions and local references is required.

- Aerial photography interpretation and additional sampling
  - API convention: dashed boundaries indicate features observed via aerial imagery; crosses denote isolated features; diamonds indicate boundaries no longer present; ignore conflicts if ground evidence contradicts API.
  - Freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP)
    - Two samples per square: flowing water (IFE) and standing water (NELUP, water beetles focus).
    - Detailed sampling protocol described in separate handbooks; samples preserved and labeled with site information for transport to Merlewood.
    - Clear marking of sample sites on the same map as IFE; line descriptions recorded to accompany samples.

- Photography and post-survey processes
  - Photography: print films captured for every vegetation plot to document habitat context; plot numbers displayed prominently on site.
  - Procedures after survey: ensure all data are complete; avoid post-survey transposition unless maps or forms are damaged; transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

- Challenges and considerations for data stewards
  - Key challenges include incomplete understanding of user needs, timely data provision, standardisation across many systems and formats, handling large datasets, and updating older databases.
  - The handbook emphasizes robust documentation, traceability, and standardised coding to support reproducibility, comparability with earlier surveys, and future data sharing.

- Access, permissions, and contingencies
  - Permissions are necessary for legal access and engagement with landowners; if permission is refused, predefined procedures determine whether fieldwork is abandoned or partial data are captured and a replacement square drawn.
  - Land ownership and contact data are recorded with a method for rating owner/cooperation to facilitate future engagement.

- Output and archival plan
  - Data collected (FABs, maps, aerial photos, and samples) are intended for return to ITE Merlewood for analysis and long-term storage; permanent markers support future re-location and longitudinal analysis.
  - The approach supports two-tier data integration: detailed ground data and satellite/remote sensing linkage for enhanced landscape-scale interpretation.
