# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Overview
  - Standardised, national field survey framework supporting time-series data collection for countryside monitoring.
  - Integrates soil, Calluna vegetation, and freshwater biota sampling with photography and GPS data logging.
  - Emphasises robust data quality, consistent methodologies, and clear data handling procedures to support policy-relevant reporting and long-term data stewardship.

- Sampling framework and data types
  - Soil sampling (Section 10.7)
    - In each X-plot center, collect five replicate soil samples from three cores using specific pipe sizes.
    - Samples prepared and mailed to ITE Merlewood; rapid processing required for certain cores; clear packaging and labeling requirements.
  - Calluna sampling (Section 10.9–10.10)
    - Within 1 km squares containing Calluna vulgaris, collect current year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight).
    - Samples sealed, labeled, and dispatched to ITE Merlewood; timing coordinated with field operations.
  - Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11; Section III)
    - Coordinated with Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE); IFE staff may sample in parallel.
    - Sampling plans aligned with overall survey timing and square coverage.
  - Data capture and coding
    - Standardised FABs (Field Assessment Books) for site coordinates, ownership, physiography, vegetation, and usage; extensive coding guidance.
    - Annexed GPS data collection guidelines and per-plot data file naming conventions.

- Equipment, logistics, and data handling
  - Equipment distribution
    - Some items distributed to teams by regional coordinators; others provided as standard CS2000 equipment.
  - Sample handling and transport
    - Clear procedures for placing samples in labeled bags, envelopes, and post despatch to ITE Merlewood.
    - If sampling issues arise, include written notes in the shipment.
  - Post-survey procedures
    - Ensure data sheets are complete, with minimal need for transcription; transport FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.

- Photography (Section 11)
  - One camera per team; initial film stocks provided; additional films claimed via T&S.
  - Photograph every vegetation plot to capture general appearance and position relative to landmarks.
  - Reference features must be obvious, permanent, and clearly visible; each photo must include square/plot identifiers on a marker board and be framed to show plot context.

- GPS data capture and management (Annex 1)
  - Pre-logging checks: ensure satellite count (at least 4), PDOP ideally below 6 for 3D fixes.
  - Data logging: stationary (plot) and moving (new feature) positions recorded with per-plot data files named after square and plot (e.g., 501X4.PSE).
  - File naming and attributes: use a standardized attribute reference to quickly select plots; create separate files for each feature to enable precise geographic positioning.
  - Practical considerations: manage obstructions (trees, hedges) by elevating the GPS antenna; maintain battery power; use almanac updates when needed.

- Procedures after survey
  - Daily data checks: review data sheets to ensure no omissions.
  - Transcription should be avoided unless essential; damaged maps should be replaced carefully.
  - Transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations as soon as possible.

- Annex: GPS data collection (detailed steps)
  - Step-by-step guidance on operating the GPS unit, including battery checks, stationary vs moving logging, creating file names, and handling common issues (PDOP, obstructions, almanac updates).
  - Emphasises the need for clear, square-and-plot-specific data files and accurate feature naming for subsequent data integration.

- Data governance implications for data leaders
  - Demonstrates a rigorous, repeatable workflow enabling high-quality, harmonised time-series data across multiple domains (soil, vegetation, freshwater).
  - Highlights the importance of metadata, standardized codes, and explicit data handling procedures to support interoperability and policy-aligned reporting.
  - Provides structured methodologies for permissions, data quality control, change documentation, and integration with national biodiversity monitoring efforts.
