The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Purpose and scope

- Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007 as the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification-based framework.
- Emphasises the need for a consistent, time-series framework to monitor environmental health and policy performance across Great Britain.
- Highlights the link between classification, stratified sampling, and national estimates, including country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland).

## Core concepts: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling

- The ITE Land Classification stratifies land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to ensure representative sampling.
- Stratified, random sampling is used to avoid bias and capture ecological variability; sampling units are 1 km squares.
- Early development started with 1228 centre squares in a 15x15 km grid, with surrounding squares allocated to classes, resulting in an initial set of 32 land classes.
- National estimates are derived by combining per-class statistics (e.g., mean habitat area per square) with the total area of each class.

## Historical progression of the sampling framework

- 1978 (CS1978): First field survey using 32 Land Classes; 8 squares per class (256 total); 1 km square sampling for national estimates.
- 1984 (CS1984): Second field survey; 12 squares per class (384 total); estimates still based on the original 1978 Land Classification.
- 1990 (CS1990): All Squares Land Classification; 508 squares surveyed; added land-use features and repeated vegetation quadrats; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998 (CS1998/CS2000 framework): Land Classification expanded to allow Scotland-only reporting; classes increased to 40; methodology adjusted to classify all GB squares with surrogates for major climatic/geological factors.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting introduced; Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (England+Wales and Scotland); total still aimed at representative country-level estimates; additional Welsh squares added to ensure adequate representation; uplands module introduced to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.

## Sampling framework and country-specific reporting

- Sub-division and aggregation of Land Classes created 40-45 strata to reflect country needs.
- Additional squares allocated to improve representation of new classes; 19 extra in Wales (plus adjustments in England) to support Wales-only estimates.
- Wales-specific adjustments led to class changes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and a revised England-with-Wales and Scotland map for CS2000; further refinements for Wales in CS2007.
- An uplands module added in CS2000 to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## National estimates and methodological notes

- The document discusses a 2006 scoping study noting that changing the basic classification used for national estimates affects consistency across surveys.
- For consistency within a single survey, using the latest classification is preferred; for cross-survey consistency, older classifications may be used.
- Table 4 in the document provides the number of squares per class across surveys when using the Original (1990) Land Classification, illustrating how sample sizes and class counts evolved.

## Outputs and accessibility

- Survey outputs are presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and datasets are stored/uploaded to appropriate portals to maximize dataset value and accessibility for others.

## Endnotes and references

- Includes acknowledgements, further reading, and a detailed appendix outlining the history and development of the ITE Land Classification and its application to Countryside Survey over time.
