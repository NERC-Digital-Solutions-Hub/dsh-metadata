# FIELD HANDBOOK

- A comprehensive guide for the Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) detailing standardized, GIS-ready methods to plan, record, map, and analyze land use, habitats, and vegetation across Great Britain and the Isle of Man.
- Emphasizes producing comparable, time-series data and strong integration with GIS and remote-sensing outputs for policy, conservation, and scientific analysis.

## GIS-focused aims and outputs

- Provide GIS-ready data products: map-based outputs and linked attribute data to support policy monitoring and biodiversity assessments.
- Enable time-series analyses by repeating surveys in a structured, square-based framework and by linking field data with remote-sensing inputs.
- Deliver outputs aligned with biodiversity and sustainable development frameworks (e.g., Biodiversity Action Plans, EU directives).
- Produce base maps and theme maps (Physiography, Agriculture, Forestry, Boundaries, Buildings/Communications/Recreation, pond locations) and enable cross-referencing with satellite land-cover maps.

## Data streams and integration

- Three core data streams:
  - Mapping: annotated 1:10,000 maps with standardized primary/secondary codes for land cover, features, and boundaries.
  - Vegetation plots: species, cover, and structure using standardized methods.
  - Sampling: targeted plots and associated measurements (areal plots, hedgerows, margins, streams, verges, etc.).
- Change-focused mapping: old squares mapped for changes from CS1990; new squares mapped de novo with documentation of novel features.
- Broad Habitats framework: results organized by Broad Habitats to support biodiversity assessments; distinction between Mappable and Plottable Broad Habitats.
- Data themes support integration with GIS layers and time-series analyses; includes ponds and erosion-related data for MAFF and national indicators.

## Sampling design and field layout

- Core sampling unit: 1 x 1 km squares; CS1990 baseline of 508 squares expanded to 568 squares in CS2000.
- Six teams across six stations; each team manages ~95 squares per year; surveys span about four days per square.
- Time-series planning emphasizes re-surveying existing squares for continuity and adding new squares to capture novel land classes.
- Plot management: plots must be spaced (e.g., 10 m minimum for linear plots) with precise relocation records (bearings/distances); no overlapping plots on the same feature.
- GPS-based relocation supported by Annex 1; field methods designed to link ground data with GIS layers and time-series.

## FAB system: data recording and coding

- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB): integrated sheets and 1:10,000 maps for data capture, GIS loading, and auditability.
- Coding structure:
  - Primary vs secondary codes; emphasis on dominant uses and logical sequencing.
  - Boundary and change indicators: 999 (boundary no longer present), 888 (new boundary on map), 701 (genuine change), 702 (probable mis-recording in 1990).
  - New parcels, renumbering, and feature splits/merges managed via FABs and cross-referenced on theme maps.
- Plot and feature classifications:
  - Ownership, Physiography, Inland Water/Coastal, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Forestry/Woodland/Trees, Boundaries, Buildings/Structures/Communications, Universal codes.
  - Plot types: X plots (Large 200 m² with nested, multi-scale plots), Y plots (Small 2 m x 2 m), U plots (Unenclosed), B plots (Boundary), A plots (Arable margins), H plots (Hedgerows), S/W plots (Streamside/Verge), R/V plots (Roadside/Verge).
  - Vegetation data: standardized species lists, cover codes, dominant species, mosaics, bryophytes/lichens from predefined lists, and handling of challenging taxa.
- Plot relocation and data integrity:
  - Detailed relocation guidance, with GPS-enabled plots and ground plans; consistent documentation to support reproducibility.

## Plot types, sampling, and relocation specifics

- Nested sampling framework:
  - X plots: 200 m² with nested subplots (4 m² inner plots and multiple sizes) for intensive vegetation sampling.
  - Y plots: five 2 m x 2 m plots across land-cover types.
  - U plots: up to 10 plots in unenclosed habitats.
  - B plots: 200 m² boundary-focused plots (hedges, walls, fences).
  - A plots: 100 x 1 m margins adjacent to B plots.
  - H plots: two 10 m boundary plots per hedge; additional D plots for hedgerow diversity.
  - S/W plots: linear plots along waterways; R/V plots near roads/verges.
- Relocation accuracy targets and non-overlapping placement to ensure spatial integrity over time.

## Permissions, access, and planning

- Landowner consent required for access; if access is refused, replace the square or record partial surveys for surveyable areas.
- Collect landowner context where possible; maintain courtesy with landowners and agents.
- Six teams across six stations; flexible scheduling and travel planning to optimize fieldwork.

## Planning outputs and GIS integration

- Deliverables include FAB-encoded field data and mapped features; base and theme maps for multiple domains (Physiography, Agriculture, Forestry, Boundaries, Buildings, Pond data, etc.).
- Data are designed to be integrated with GIS layers and time-series analyses; enables change detection and cross-reference with satellite-derived land-cover data.
- Annotated ponds and erosion-related data support cross-agency coordination and national indicators.

## Practical guidelines for GIS specialists

- Maintain strict, standardized coding and parcel-tracking for reliable spatial-temporal analyses.
- Use CS1990 as the baseline for CS2000 changes; manage changes via New Parcel Numbers and cross-referencing on FABs and theme maps.
- Distinguish Mappable vs Plottable Broad Habitats to optimize mapping efficiency; plan for U-plots in upland contexts.
- Ensure plots are adequately spaced and that relocation is precisely documented (bearings, distances, and notes).
- Prioritize data quality, reproducibility, and GIS-ready output: standardized field methods, clear decision logs, and consistent FAB usage for downstream processing.

## Annex and GPS guidance

- Annex 1: GPS data collection procedures for plot relocation, including battery checks, satellite counts, PDOP considerations, stationary vs moving position recording, file-naming conventions (e.g., 501X4.PSE), and data logging steps.
- GPS data handling emphasizes 4+ satellites, PDOP < 6 for 3D fixes, and robust relocation with bearings/distances.
- Guidance on handling almanac updates, battery management, and Magellan keypad usage for data entry.

## Section 10- Sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater)

- Three sampling types: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling (the latter by IFE staff).
- Soil sampling: five replicate cores per 1 km square, collected in X-plots; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiological analyses; detailed pipeline and packaging instructions.
- Calluna sampling: within every square with Calluna vulgaris, collect current-year growth shoots (CYG) for foliar nitrogen and related analyses to assess atmospheric nitrogen deposition effects; standardized collection, drying, and mailing procedures.
- Freshwater sampling: coordinated with IFE staff timing; integration with field work for consistent GIS-referenced data.
- Data handling and transport: explicit packaging, labeling, and post-delivery procedures to ensure sample integrity and traceability.

## Section 11- Photography and Section 12- Procedures after survey

- Photography: one camera per team; photograph each vegetation plot to document appearance and landmarks; ensure reference features are obvious, permanent, and within frame; individual photos labeled with square/plot identifiers.
- Post-survey procedures: verify data sheets for completeness; avoid re-transcription unless necessary; transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

## Annex: GPS data specifics

- Detailed steps for starting/stopping logging, file naming, stationary vs moving feature recording, and handling of PDOP and satellite conditions.
- Emphasis on creating separate files per plot/feature, with clear naming to support GIS workflows and future retrieval.

## Section 10- Sampling (additional context)

- Background on soil sustainability and the rationale for establishing baseline soil data across CS2000 squares to support future indices of soil biological activity and diversity.
- Strategic sampling plan to reflect Land Class and Land Cover types and to support national soil indicators within an archival framework.
