# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Aims and purpose
  - Update land-use and vegetation datasets to reflect changes in the rural environment.
  - Provide current data for scientific evaluation of ecological systems and trend assessment.
  - Link bottom-up field survey data with top-down remote sensing through a two-tier approach.
  - Standardise field recording across observers to improve statistical accuracy and enable future comparability.

- Scope and background
  - Builds on UK surveys from 1977/78 and 1984, with a 1988 reduction in sample squares.
  - Expansion planned for 1990: resurvey of prior sites plus enhanced detail and collaboration; target 512 sites (128 new).
  - Emphasises ground-truthing to connect satellite imagery with field observations; focuses on land cover, vegetation, and landscape features.

- Survey design and planning
  - Sample structure: six groups of sites, each staffed by teams from six ITE Research Stations; about 85 squares per group.
  - Time planning: each square ~3 days; flexible working, with emphasis on minimizing travel and avoiding unnecessary re-visits; travel time prioritized over overtime.
  - Completion expectations: permanent markers and relocation plans to ensure repeatability; more squares than in earlier surveys to improve coverage and comparability.

- Data collection framework (FAB-based)
  - Three core elements: mapping (the primary geospatial layer), recording quadrats (vegetation units), and sampling (quantitative sampling, including plots).
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FAB) pair with 1:10,000 maps to capture multi-layered data; a structured code system enables compact, rich annotation.
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) supplements field data for boundary delineation and feature identification; API guidance is ground-truthing with field judgement prevailing when conflicts arise.
  - Permanent markers and standardized recording practices to ensure future relocatability and data integrity.

- Equipment and field preparations
  - Provided by Merlewood (FABs, large-scale site photographs, maps, weatherproof gear, marker plates, sampling tools, etc.).
  - Local ITE stations provide locational aids, basic field tools, camera gear, and personal equipment.
  - Survey teams to carry identity and landowner information; emphasises field judgement and on-site decision-making.

- Permissions and stakeholder engagement
  - Prior contact with farmers/landowners to secure access and establish rapport; separate ownership information collection to support coordination.
  - If access is refused, predefined contingencies guide whether to abandon or partially complete a square and to document outcomes for replacement site selection.
  - Documented ownership and contact details, with a mechanism to rate owner cooperation to aid future surveys.

- Data recording and coding standards (FAB mechanics)
  - Use of primary and secondary codes to annotate features on 6" maps; alpha codes represent combinations of numeric codes to save space and improve readability.
  - Every feature requires at least one primary code; maintain logical code order (e.g., a vegetation code followed by boundary or boundary-related codes).
  - Boundaries and other structures mapped with explicit end-points and perpendicular markers; “no longer present” boundaries coded as 999.
  - The minimum mappable unit is 1/25 ha; minimum mapped length is 20 m; dotted lines invite further information but should not clutter the map.

- Mapping and API (6.1)
  - Detailed mapping of land-use and landscape features on enlarged 1:10,000 sheets; integrate multiple codes per unit to reflect mosaic habitats.
  - Aerial photo interpretation (API) provides guidance on boundaries and isolated features; field-verified on-ground evidence takes precedence.

- Field data recording (FAB filling; 6.1.2)
  - FABs must be completed neatly; essential to record square numbers on every page; pencil preferred for easy correction and waterproofing.
  - Procedure for recording vegetation: list species present, assign nested quadrat data, and provide 5% cover categories; unlisted species noted at the bottom.
  - Include sketch maps and an accompanying photo for context; where identification is difficult, collect specimens for later lab work.
  - Ownership, farmer interviews, physiography, and other metadata documented on dedicated pages.

- Vegetation sampling and plot types (6.2)
  - General approach: standardised vegetation recording from plots of varying sizes; a standard form governs all plot types.
  - Plot sizes and types
    - Quadrats: five 200 m2 large quadrats and five 4 m2 quadrats in semi-natural vegetation.
    - Five small 2 m x 2 m quadrats in five different land-cover types per square (additional to large quadrats).
    - Linear plots: up to 5 plots along boundaries, hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides to capture linear habitat variation.
  - Plot laying and relocation
    - Quadrats positioned to reflect habitat centers; relocation rules for land-use changes or new site conditions; provisions to adjust plot locations while documenting changes.
    - Permanent marking with metal plates for easy relocation; detailed sketches and distances recorded.
  - Linear plots (hedgerows, roadsides, streamsides)
    - 1 m wide plots positioned at defined offsets from dominant linear features; careful placement to avoid overlap and ensure distinct sampling.
    - If original linear plot positions from 1978 exist, relocate as closely as possible; if not feasible, document relocation rationale clearly.
  - Recording within plots
    - All species recorded using the FAB form; cover estimated in 5% increments; multi-layer vegetation allowed with total cover potentially exceeding 100%.
    - Bracken treated specially; certain species combinations allowed when precise ID is uncertain.
  - Species identification guidelines
    - Allowable species combinations for ambiguous identifications to maintain consistency with historical surveys.
    - Comprehensive list of common plant species (Crops, Grasses, Sedges/Rushes, Ferns, Forbs/Woody etc.) with cross-references to shorthand codes used on forms.
  - Trees and woodland (vii Boundaries; vi Forestry / Woodland / Trees)
    - Woodland data coded using woodland/forest codes; blocks subdivided by age and composition; canopy and age structure documented.
    - Special codes cover condition, management, regeneration, felling, and underplanting; also capture land-use interactions (grazing, bracken, etc.).
  - Boundaries and human-made features
    - Detailed coding for walls, fences, hedges (dominant species, height, gaps, and signs of management), banks and valls, and other boundary types; includes visuals for “relict” or recently trimmed boundaries.
  - Buildings, settlements, and communications
    - Built features coded for urban-adjacent land uses; curtilages recorded with or without trees; designated urban amenities and transport features mapped with color and code conventions to aid discoverability.

- Freshwater and sampling components
  - Freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP)
    - Two standing-water samples per square (vegetated ponds, lakes, ditches, calcareous/acid flushes, bogs, etc.); sampling involves collecting biota with sieve, fixation in formalin, labeling with square, date, and surveyor.
    - IFE biota sampling uses a separate handbook; NELUP sampling focuses on water beetles and related aquatic biota; samples prioritized to reflect characteristic water habitats within each square.
  - Documentation
    - Samples are labeled, bagged, and transported under chain-of-custody protocols to Merlewood for processing.

- Photography and documentation
  - Photograph each vegetation plot to capture general appearance and key landmarks; place a labeling board at the plot edge with the plot number; ensure visibility of marker plates.

- Procedures after fieldwork
  - End-of-day data checks to ensure completeness; avoid post-hoc data edits unless damage to original forms necessitates it.
  - Transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly for processing and archival storage.

- Data quality, standards, and governance
  - Emphasis on consistency across observers; standard Field Handbook as a prerequisite for field staff.
  - Permanent markers, relocation protocols, and standardized plotting enable robust longitudinal comparisons.
  - Comprehensive code lists and nomenclature provided for crops, grasses, forbs, bryophytes, and lichens to maintain comparability with earlier ITE surveys.

- For Data Leaders (strategic takeaways)
  - Data architecture: a multi-layered data collection approach (mapping, quadrats, sampling) with explicit metadata, standardized codes, and permanent markers for repeatability.
  - Interoperability: alignment with satellite-based land-cover mapping through a two-tier approach that integrates bottom-up field data with top-down imagery.
  - Data quality governance: standardization of field methods, training, and quality-control procedures to reduce observer variation.
  - Data discoverability and reuse: detailed FABs, maps, and API guidance support future analyses, re-use in partner networks, and cross-study comparability.
  - Operational efficiency: travel-time optimization, flexible scheduling, and explicit permissions processes help scale the survey across a national network of sites.
