# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Overview and Aims
- Document outlines the field methodology for the Countryside Survey 1990, with the goal of updating land use databases, monitoring change, and providing current data for ecological and policy analyses.
- Emphasizes standardised data collection, ground-truthing, and integration of multiple data sources (field surveys, satellite imagery, and map-derived data).
- Aims to produce comparable, high-quality datasets across a broad range of land-cover types and landscape features.

## Survey Design and Sampling Framework
- Total of 512 sample squares; sample squares grouped into six regional/station-based groups, with ~85 squares per group.
- Two-phase resurvey plan including:
  - Re-survey of previously-sampled sites to track change.
  - Inclusion of 128 new sites (total 512) to enhance national coverage.
- A two-tier approach linking bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing (satellite imagery) to improve landscape-scale projection and ground-truthing.
- Strong emphasis on standardising field recording (Field Handbook) and quality control to minimise observer variation.

## Planning, Permissions, and Logistics
- Detailed planning of fieldwork logistics, travel, and flexibility for staff availability.
- Permissions from landowners/farmers are required for access; procedures include prior letters, on-site confirmation, and clear escalation if access is denied.
- Clear guidelines for handling refusals (abandon square, or proceed with partial survey if feasible) to avoid wasted effort.
- Ownership and contact information are recorded on the Field Assessment Booklet (FAB), with a scoring system to indicate helpfulness of landowners.

## Equipment and Field Tools
- Field equipment largely standardised and supplied across Merlewood and local ITE stations.
- Key items include FABs (Field Assessment Booklets), aerial photographs, maps, weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, marker plates, measuring tapes, navigation aids, and personal gear.
- Additional gear supplied by local stations and surveyors, including cameras, lenses, first aid, field reference books, and protective clothing.

## Data Recording and FAB Structure
- The Countryside Survey 1990 uses three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter covered in Section 7).
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) combines: mapping, quadrat data, and ownership/farmer information, with a structured page order and codes.
- Data coding system:
  - Primary and secondary data codes; alpha codes used to compress multiple numeric codes (e.g., A B C) into single-letter representations.
  - Codes cover boundaries, land use, vegetation types, physiography, ownership, and other landscape features.
  - Boundaries and features are annotated with explicit instructions (e.g., 999 for no longer present; 888 for new features).
  - For woodland, trees, and hedges, specific primary/secondary code rules apply and all features must have a dominant primary code.
- Documentation and quality: FABs must be neat and unambiguous; the survey team should provide notes where interpretation is uncertain; a complete square should be captured with edge-to-edge coding.

## Field Survey Procedures and Plot Types
- Survey procedures vary by land type and accessibility, but a recommended framework is provided to ensure full-square coverage.
- Plot types included in each square:
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 quadrats with nested 4 m2 subplots; full 200 m2 plots mapped and recorded.
  - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m quadrats placed in five different semi-natural/natural land cover types in each square.
  - Linear plots: up to five per feature type (boundary plots at 1 x 10 m, hedgerow plots, streamside plots, roadside plots) to capture linear habitat variation.
  - Boundary, hedgerow, streamside, and roadside plots have specific placement rules relative to features and field boundaries; permanent marker plates are used for relocation and repeat visits.
  - Extra verge plots: up to three additional plots to sample verge types along roads/tracks (categories defined for urban-rural interfaces and road types).
- 1978 rules for locating linear plots are referenced and integrated to ensure consistency with earlier surveys where applicable.

## Vegetation Sampling and Species Coding
- Quadrats and plots are used to collect vegetation data at multiple scales:
  - Large quadrats: 200 m2 with inner nested 4 m2 quadrats; species lists and cover estimates compiled across nested plots.
  - Small quadrats: 2 m x 2 m, integrated into the broader vegetation mosaic of the square.
- Species recording:
  - A standard species list (approx. 200 common species) is used; unlisted species are added with location and estimate.
  - Cover estimates are recorded in 5% bands; species with <5% cover are not tabulated.
  - bryophytes and lichens are recorded from a restricted list; some bryophytes/lichens listed for targeted recording.
  - Certain species combinations are allowed where indistinguishable without specimens (consistent with historical ITE practices).
- Colour and drawing conventions: use of colour coding and maps, with attention to keeping plots manageable and legible on FABs.
- Permanent marking: quadrats are marked with metal plates (or field-bound markers) for easy relocation in future surveys.

## Habitat Descriptions and Coding
- Extensive coding framework for physiography (inland water, coastal), land cover, and habitat types (grassland, heath, moorland, wetlands, woodlands, trees, etc.).
- Ground cover and height classes:
  - Cover types for grassland and moorland with detailed subcategories (e.g., upland grassland, moorland shrub heath, Calcareous grassland, etc.).
  - Species-level codes for dominant canopy and ground cover, with limitations on number of codes per feature.
- Woodland and trees:
  - Woodland/forestry codes describe age, structure, management status, and use (timber production, landscape, public recreation, nature conservation, etc.).
  - Tree- and shrub-specific metrics include canopy cover, age classes, and transitions (fenced, regrowth, underplanting, etc.).
- Boundaries and man-made features:
  - Comprehensive codes for walls, fences, hedges (and hedgerows), banks, verges, and other boundary types.
  - Descriptions capture height, stockproof characteristics, gaps, maintenance status, and signs of alteration.

## Freshwater Biota and Sampling (7)
- Two freshwater biota sampling streams:
  - IFE (Institute of Freshwater Ecology) freshwater biota from flowing waters (detailed protocol in a separate handbook).
  - NELUP (Newcastle University) freshwater biota sampling, focusing on water beetles; two standing-water samples per square (vegetated waters preferred).
- Site selection for standing waters includes lakes/lochs, ponds, dried streams/pools, calcareous/acid flushes, Sphagnum pools, and other depressions with water.
- Sampling logistics include labeling bottles, time limits for searching, and transport to Merlewood for processing.

## Photography
- Print photography of every vegetation plot to document general appearance and key landmarks.
- Plot number clearly displayed on a board at plot edge to aid location.

## Procedures Subsequent to Survey and Data Handling
- End-of-day checks to ensure no features are omitted; avoid post-hoc data re-entry unless necessary due to damage.
- FABs and samples are transported to ITE stations promptly for analysis and processing.
- Coordination and contact details provided for ongoing data collection and dissemination.

## Endnotes and Contacts
- The document is authored by Colin Barr and revised for 1991, with background information and support contacts at Merlewood Research Station and ITE.
- References to additional ITE field handbooks, code lists, and data dictionaries to support consistent data interpretation across years.
