# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Large-scale land use and landscape monitoring to update land-use databases and support ecological assessment and modelling.
  - Combines ground field survey with remote sensing (satellite imagery) to create a Britain-wide land cover map and ground-truth data.
  - Re-survey planned for 1990 to detect changes since 1978/1984 and integrate new data types, including more detailed information and collaboration.

- Study design and sampling
  - 512 squares sampled in 1990, drawn from six groups and surveyed by six ITE Research Stations; each station covers about 85 squares.
  - Each square planned to take about three field days; flexible scheduling with considerations for travel, access, and leave.
  - Permanent, repeatable sampling framework to enable future comparisons; 128 new squares plus 128 previously surveyed squares.

- Equipment and field setup
  - Equipment primarily for mapping and recording: FABs (Field Assessment Booklets), 1:10,000 aerial/photo basemaps, maps, weatherproof clipboards, marking tools, sampling gear, navigation aids, first-aid, and personal gear.
  - Local stations provide additional tools; field recording requires careful marking and documentation to enable relocation.

- Field procedures and workflow
  - Permissions
    - Obtain access permissions for the entire square to avoid wasted work; maintain good relations with landowners and keep records of ownership and contact attempts.
    - If permission is refused, abandon the square or adjust sites per guidelines; contact coordinators and log issues.
  - Survey process
    - On-site reconnaissance to assess access and problems; choose a suitable route to cover the entire square; document any omissions.
    - Complete records thoroughly; ensure neatness and legibility of FABs for later analysis.
  - Mapping and FAB completion
    - The core activity is mapping with rapid, coded annotations on 1:10,000 maps, using primary/secondary codes and alpha codes to describe features.
    - Use alpha codes to represent multiple numeric codes to save space; maintain consistency in coding order (dominant use codes first where multiple apply).
  - Data interpretation and field decisions
    - Field decisions are crucial; boundary definitions, feature presence, and changes must be recorded in the field with notes where necessary.
  - Photography
    - Take photographs of vegetation plots for context and reference; label plots clearly.

- Data recording and coding (FAB)
  - Structure: FAB combines mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling data; quadrats, linear plots, and sampling are the main data types.
  - Codes and categories
    - Boundaries: map type and status; include both actual and interpreted boundaries with notes for any that no longer exist.
    - Boundaries, hedges, fences, walls, and other boundary types coded with primary and secondary codes; ensure consistency and logical ordering (e.g., a cover code followed by species).
    - Buildings, curtilages, and urban features categorized with a separate building/curtilage coding scheme and color conventions for GIS mapping.
    - Woodlands/forestry: use woodland codes to describe canopy, age, species, and management status; separate woodland features from surrounding land use.
    - Physiography, inland water bodies, coasts, and banks: standardized codes capture elevation, slope, water features, banks, and edges.
    - Cover types and species codes: extensive list of GB land-cover categories (grasslands, moorlands, bracken, crops, trees, aquatic vegetation, heaths, wetlands, etc.); species lists for common ground flora, grasses, and bryophytes with 5% cover thresholds to trigger recording; combinations allowed for uncertain identifications.
    - Universal/nested codes: long list of universal, boundary, road verge, and designed recreation areas with explicit mappings to data fields.
  - Documentation and data quality
    - Complete FABs neatly and legibly; record series numbers on every page, and ensure consistent mapping between codes and features.
    - If a feature is too complex for single codes, use color conventions and notes to convey details; avoid overloading maps with links between codes and features.
    - For vegetation, use nested quadrats and the 200 m2 large quadrat with inner 4 m2 quadrats, progressively building up to a final 200 m2 cover estimate.

- Vegetation sampling specifics (6.2)
  - Plot types
    - Quadrats: Five 200 m2 large quadrats (valley plots) with nested 4 m2 quadrats; five 2 m x 2 m small quadrats in natural/semi-natural land.
    - Linear plots: up to five per square for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides (1 m wide) to capture linear habitat variation.
    - Boundary and roadside plots: located at boundaries or verge edges with precise marker placement.
    - Streamside and aquatic plots: consider freshwater habitats and associated flora/fauna across water and banks.
  - Plot placement and relocation
    - Quadrats positioned to reflect habitat centers; relocation guidelines exist for changed land use or missing old plots; if new land use precludes a vegetation quadrat, relocate to nearest suitable boundary or habitat type.
    - Permanent markers: metal plates placed to enable future relocation; field notes and sketches record the exact placement and distances from landmarks.
  - Laying out plots
    - Quadrats oriented to north/south and east/west axes where possible; linear plots aligned to dominant feature (hedge, bank edge, water edge) with defined 1 m width.
    - Distances and coordinates recorded, with accompanying sketches and photographs.
  - Data collection and species identification
    - Standardized 200 most frequent species list (with common GB flora) used; unlisted species documented with a note and nested quadrat reference.
    - Bryophytes and lichens recorded from a restricted list; certain species combinations allowed for practical identification when needed.
    - 5% cover thresholds applied; multiple layers may yield >100% cover in mosaic patches.
  - Vegetation sampling consent and consistency
    - Observer training and standardization emphasized to reduce recording variation across observers and years.

- Freshwater sampling and additional data
  - Freshwater biota sampling (IFE): detailed procedures described in a separate handbook; aims to collect biota from flowing waters and standing waters as part of the IFE program.
  - NELUP sampling (Newcastle University): collecting water beetles from standing waters; multiple site types to reflect the two most characteristic water habitats within each square.

- Aerial photography interpretation (API)
  - API supports identification of features not in OS maps (isolated trees, boundaries between semi-natural vegetation types, new buildings, roads).
  - Map preparation guidelines: remove non-essential labels for survey use; dashed lines mark API-identified boundaries; crosses mark isolated features; diamonds mark no-longer-present boundaries.
  - API data are guidance and may be overridden by ground-truth field observations.

- Data management, relocation, and long-term use
  - Permanent marking and relocation planning enable consistent re-survey in future years.
  - Data and FABs to be returned to ITE Merlewood stations promptly after survey; QA steps include post-day reviews to avoid omissions.
  - The framework supports linking field data to maps across time for change detection and modelling.

- Outputs and potential GIS applications
  - Detailed, coded field data tied to 1:10,000 maps and FABs suitable for integration into GIS workflows.
  - Rich datasets for land cover mapping, vegetation communities, boundaries, and woodland structure; supports landscape-scale ecological modelling and policy analysis.
  - Standardized coding scheme enables cross-square comparisons and temporal analyses across the Countryside Survey time series.
