# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Overview of the quality assurance (QA) effort conducted for the 1990 Countryside Survey, including scope, results, and recommendations.

## Aims and Methodology

- Aims
  - Quantify the accuracy of field recording in 1990 and comment on change statistics.
  - Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, time of year, location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
  - Relate conclusions to previous survey work.
  - Recommend methodological modifications for future surveys to improve accuracy and confidence in statistics.
- QA Series and Timeline
  - Autumn 1990 QA: 21 original survey squares; relied on original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991 QA: added photographs to aid relocation; included self-assessment and expanded itinerary; addressed 1 km squares from each terrain class; majority of squares visited near original survey date.
- Plot Types and Data Collected
  - Plot types subdivided into quadrats: 200 m2 X-plots, 4 m2 Y-plots; linear plots; roadverges; hedges; streamsides; boundaries.
  - Location methods included relocations from sketch maps, photographs, and metal detector plates; within-square sampling included predetermined points for landcover and boundaries.
- Relocation and Data Collection
  - Plate relocation, relaying on sketch maps and photographs; plates had varying recovery rates.
  - Use of photographs and plates significantly improved relocation success; Y-plots remained particularly challenging.
- Data and Documentation
  - Annotations and forms documented; Annexes detail data forms, plot grids, and methods.

## Key Findings on Data Quality

- Species Recording and Concordance
  - 1990 vs. 1991 comparison showed increased species numbers per plot in 1991, largely due to real ecological differences between drought year (1990) and a more normal growing season (1991) rather than solely recording improvements.
  - Overall species list concordance across time: around 60% (combining several concordance measures) with seasonal effects and relocation errors acknowledged.
  - About 13% of species differences were attributed to genuine ecological change or seasonal/management effects; the remainder often related to recording or relocation issues.
- Efficiency and Error Attribution
  - Initial efficiency of recording around 74% (before removing time-of-year effects); improvements observed when controlling for time-of-year and relocation factors.
  - The 1991 QA suggested roughly 27% of the species increase could be attributed to improved recording efficiency, with about 73% attributed to genuine differences in species composition due to growing-season and drought differences.
- Plot Relocation and Plot Types
  - X-plots relocated more reliably than Y-plots; roadverges and hedges easier to relocate than small quadrats.
  - Use of photos markedly improved relocation accuracy; metal plates useful but time-consuming in unenclosed uplands.
  - Plate recovery rates varied by plot type; overall, relocation and matching accuracy depended on landclass (lowland vs. upland) and plot type.
- Cover Estimates
  - Visual cover estimates for species recorded at both times showed few significant differences for a small number of species; several species exhibited changes likely due to seasonal/mgmt changes.
  - Bryophytes and some grasses were identified as under-recorded or inconsistently recorded; recommendations call for expanded bryophyte coverage in training and QA.
- Landuse Mapping and Codes
  - Primary landuse code allocations showed high concordance (about 88.7% overall) between 1990 survey and QA assessments; boundary codes and descriptive qualifiers had slightly lower concordance.
  - Some codes were problematic (e.g., marsh 114, upland vs. blanket moorland distinctions); recommendations to subdivide and refine codes for clarity and consistency.
  - Mapping of boundaries and hedges required improved definitions to reduce misclassifications; emphasis on recording hedge composition with qualifying codes.
- Mapping of Vegetation and Species Cover
  - Point grid concordance for individual species at mapped points was high for single species (81%), but much lower for co-dominant species (around 34% for two, ~5% for three co-dominants).
  - Recommendation to focus on the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit to improve reproducibility; limit detailed cover coding to major species.
- Temporal and Spatial Considerations
  - Seasonal and year-to-year climatic differences significantly affected species composition and detection; stronger similarity in upland sites than lowland arable sites.
  - Recommendation to conduct QA in the same year and season as the original survey to minimize climate-related variation.
- Data Handling and Recommendations
  - Photographs should be annotated and linked to the respective plots; photos should clearly show ground area and distinguishing features.
  - Metal plates for plot localization were generally successful; additional manpower may be required for relocation in unenclosed uplands.
  - Training should emphasize grass identification and bryophyte recording; expand species lists for habitat-specific surveys, especially where National Vegetation Classification is used.
  - Codes should be simplified and clarified; propose expanding and refining landuse categories (e.g., subdividing upland grassland and recognizing lowland rush pastures, bog/peat types).

## Implications for Data Governance and Stewardship

- Data Provenance and QA Integration
  - The study demonstrates the value of embedding QA results, metadata, and data provenance into the published dataset to enable reproducibility and auditability.
- Metadata and Documentation
  - Comprehensive metadata needed for codes, plot types, and survey methods; explicit definitions for landuse, boundary and cover codes; versioning of field handbook references.
- Standardization and Code Management
  - Need for standardized, well-documented data dictionaries and code lists; explicit rules to reduce interpretive variation between assessors and over time.
- Data Sharing and Reusability
  - Photos, plates, sketches, and QA results are data assets that should be retained and easily linked to datasets; ensure accessibility and appropriate licensing.
- Training and Capacity Building
  - Ongoing training required to maintain consistency in species identification (notably grasses), bryophyte recording, and use of mapping codes; emphasize same-year QA for new teams.
- Integration with Vegetation Classification
  - Findings underscore challenges and opportunities for aligning field data with National Vegetation Classification, requiring clearer coding and targeted data collection.

## Recommendations (Actionable)

- QA and Timing
  - Conduct QA in the same year and season as the original survey to minimize seasonal and annual biases.
- Plot Relocation and Documentation
  - Use photographs and metal markers consistently; annotate photos with precise plot context, distances, and bearings; maintain robust plate-based localization for enclosed lands.
- Plot Type Handling
  - Improve positioning methods for small plots (Y plots); standardize orientation and ground placement using survey tapes; ensure side-oriented placement for Y-plots.
- Codes and Mapping
  - Sub-divide ambiguous landuse codes (e.g., upland grassland, bog, marsh) and add missing categories (e.g., lowland rush pasture, moist/nutrient-rich wild habitats).
  - Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge vs. other boundary types; ensure hedge composition is captured via qualifying codes.
  - Limit cover coding to the most prevalent species per vegetation unit to improve mapping reproducibility.
- Training Focus
  - Emphasize disambiguation of grasses and bryophytes; provide habitat-specific references and specimen materials; reinforce identification in training modules and QA exercises.
- Data Products and Provenance
  - Attach QA metadata, including observer identity, date, method, and any deviations; link QA results to the original and QA datasets; maintain clear versioning and change logs.
- Future Data Integration
  - When integrating with National Vegetation Classification, ensure harmonized codes and enhanced documentation of landuse and vegetation attributes to support cross-study comparisons.

## Conclusions

- Photographic aids and standardized relocation procedures substantially improve QA outcomes.
- Timing, plot type, and landclass influence accuracy; careful control of these factors is essential for reliable change statistics.
- Data governance should emphasize metadata richness, standardized coding, and explicit QA practices to ensure long-term data quality, comparability, and reusability.
