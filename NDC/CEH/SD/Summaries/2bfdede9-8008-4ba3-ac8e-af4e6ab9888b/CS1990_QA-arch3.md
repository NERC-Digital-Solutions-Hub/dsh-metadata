# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- Documents the quality assurance (QA) carried out for the 1990 Countryside Survey, presenting results and recommendations to improve future surveys.
- Aims to quantify accuracy and reliability of field recording, explain observed differences, and guide modifications to survey methodology for better accuracy and confidence in statistics.

## Aims and Scope
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in 1990 and assess the accuracy of change statistics.
- Explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, seasonality, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- Relate conclusions to previous comparative work (ITE survey) and propose methodology modifications for future surveys to improve accuracy and confidence.

## Methods and Design
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares; relied on original sketch maps; two independent assessors; limited itinerary.
  - Summer 1991: added photographs of plots; tested improvement from photographs; included one 1 km square from each of 32 terrain classes; 28 squares surveyed by the same assessors as the original survey.
- Plot types covered: six categories within quadrats and linear plots (including X-quadrats, Y-quadrat plots, road verges, hedges, streamsides, and boundaries); a quarter of each square was resurveyed to include all plot types present.
- Plot relocation and plate relocation:
  - Attempted relocation of buried plates marking quadrats using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors; assessed success rates and categorised relocation outcomes.
  - Plate relocation recovery rates: autumn 1990 ~71% (plates located within five minutes); 1991 showed higher overall relocation success when photographs were used.
- Concordance and error metrics:
  - Several indices used to compare plots across times: percentage agreement, agreement, and percentage accuracy (to adjust for season/management changes and errors in relocation).
- Data handling and scope:
  - 21 squares analyzed in autumn 1990; 28 squares reassessed in 1991 (same assessors for many plots); additional self-assessment squares included.
- Data types examined:
  - Vegetation cover estimates for selected species (Wilcoxon tests for cover differences).
  - Species lists per plot, and their changes between years.
  - Land-use mapping codes and boundary features, including primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and qualifiers.
  - DECORANA ordination axes to assess shifts in vegetation gradients.

## Key Findings

- Overall recording accuracy and change statistics
  - 1990 QA initial concordance around 45%; full 1991 QA yield showed higher agreement (60.9%) when including T2 variations, and about 74% initial accuracy in some measures.
  - With seasonal/annual adjustments removed, the remaining differences between 1990 and 1991 indicated a real increase in species per plot (approximately 13%), much of which attributed to genuine annual/seasonal differences rather than recorder error.
  - Across land classes, substantial seasonal effects varied, with upland plots showing smaller seasonal impact than lowland/marginal areas.

- Sources and nature of variation
  - Major variation types identified:
    - A: Apparent mis-identifications
    - B: Species overlooked in the original survey
    - C/D: Over-recording/seasonal changes and mis-location/alignment issues
    - E/F: Management/seasonal changes affecting species presence
    - G/H/J: Plot mis-location, mis-orientation, and other relocation issues
    - I: Species present but overlooked at second survey
  - About 40% of species mismatches arose from observer-related errors; the remainder largely from seasonal/management changes and relocation differences.
  - X plots (and road verges) were easier to relocate than Y plots; hedges and boundaries varied in difficulty; upland vs lowland differences observed in relocation efficiency.

- Plot relocation and use of photographs
  - Photograph-assisted relocation (1991) materially improved positional accuracy and reduced some relocation errors, though seasonal changes still influenced species lists.
  - Plate-based relocation was generally effective, but much slower in unenclosed upland areas; recommended plates for enclosed land to speed relocation.

- Species recording and cover estimates
  - After adjusting for seasonal and management differences, many individual species showed variable frequencies between 1990 and 1991 (some true ecological changes; others due to recording differences).
  - Across plots, most species did not show consistent, large changes in frequency; some species (e.g., Taraxacum, Galium aparine) showed apparent population changes likely due to climate/season rather than recording bias.
  - Flyers of cover values indicated limited but notable differences for certain common grasses and forbs between years; overall, cover data were sensitive to recording conventions and season.

- Land-use mapping and boundary coding
  - Primary land-use codes and broader vegetation mapping showed high concordance (roughly 88–95% for land-use primary codes; boundary primary codes around 80–85%), indicating reliable major classifications.
  - Greater variability found in upland vegetation interpretation and boundary/qualifying codes; challenges noted with codes for moorland, bog, upland grassland, and certain boundary/hedge conditions.
  - Recommendations to refine land-use coding and reduce reliance on fine-grain cover codes to improve reproducibility.

- Mapping of species cover and point-wise species concordance
  - At nine-point grid checks, strong concordance existed for dominant species but far lower for co-dominants (81% for single dominant, only about 34% for two co-dominants; near 5% for three co-dominants).
  - Concluded that mapping should emphasize the two most prevalent species per parcel to achieve higher reproducibility.

- DECORANA ordination and ecological gradient
  - Axis 1 shifts between 1990 and 1991 generally followed expected ecological gradients (uplands vs lowlands; shade tolerance), with no single cause dominating large discrepancies.
  - Across plot types, the axis shift suggested that climatic and land-use changes may be operating in concert with relocation accuracy.

- Recommendations for training and QA design
  - Improve bryophyte and particular grass identification in training and QA to reduce mis-recording of grass taxa and bryophytes.
  - Conduct QA in the same year as the original survey year to minimize climate/seasonal disparities.
  - Annotate photographs with plot distance to nearby features and ensure ground-truth markers (plates) are well positioned and documented.
  - Use metal marker plates for X plots in enclosed land to aid rapid relocation.
  - Orient Y plots with ground-based measurements using a survey tape; place SE corner with reference orientation to standardize positioning.
  - Provide more explicit guidance on recording vegetation canopy/cover to reduce variability in tree/shrub cover data.
  - Expand land-use primary codes and develop simple, dichotomous decision trees to reduce interpretive variation.
  - Recognize lowland rush pastures and wet heath as distinct vegetation types and codes to improve mapping accuracy.
  - Restrict mapping to the two most prevalent species per parcel to enhance reproducibility.
  - Improve clarity and definitions for boundary codes and hedge descriptors to minimize mis-matches.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- QA design should explicitly quantify observer error, seasonal effects, and relocation accuracy to separate true ecological change from recording artefacts.
- The use of photographs and ground markers (plates) substantially improves plot relocation reliability and should be integral to monitoring protocols.
- Metadata, including exact plot coordinates, bearings, distances to fixed features, and image annotations, is essential for reproducibility and data governance.
- Standardized, simplified coding schemes (especially for land use and vegetation cover) enhance comparability across surveys and over time.
- Training programs should emphasise key species groups (e.g., grasses, bryophytes) and provide reference materials to minimize mis-identifications.
- Timelines for QA should align with the original survey year to minimize year-to-year climatic or management differences in comparisons.

## Conclusions and Future Surveys

- Photographs are a valuable relocation aid, especially in unenclosed areas; however, consistent plotting distance and compass data are essential.
- Plate-based relocation is effective in enclosed land but slower in uplands; increased staffing may be required for large upland surveys.
- Y plots present particular relocation challenges; improved ground-positioning methods and explicit photographic contextualization are recommended.
- Species identification was generally robust, but grass taxa and bryophytes require targeted training and QA emphasis.
- Seasonal and year-to-year climatic differences significantly influence species lists; QA should be conducted within the same year or season as the original survey to minimize these effects.
- Land-use mapping codes should be expanded and simplified to improve reproducibility; mapping should focus on the two most prevalent species per parcel to improve consistency.
- The overall results support continuing the Countryside Survey QA approach for future iterations, with specific procedural refinements to enhance data quality, comparability, and governance.
