# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Key data governance and coding standards

- Provides standardized taxon coding schemes for field data, including FERNS, FORBS/WOODY SPECIES, and MOSSES/LICHENS, linking numeric codes to specific taxa (e.g., 53, 138, 851, 587, etc.). Codes are used across FABs and maps to ensure consistency over time and between observers.
- Emphasizes traceability and provenance through linking field observations to map features via Parcel numbers, parcel codes, primary codes, and New Parcel Numbers, enabling robust change tracking and audit trails.

## Data collection, management and provenance

- Field data are organized into Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) to consolidate data and maps by square; emphasis on neat, legible entries to support downstream analysis.
- Data forms, theme maps, BAP maps, and ponds maps are produced from FAB-derived data; GPS annexes provide geo-referencing capabilities.
- Documentation of data changes and reasons (change reliability codes) is required to maintain data lineage across survey years.

## Sampling design and procedures

- Soil sampling (CS2000): five replicate soil samples per 1 km square, collected in each X-plot centre, to support soil chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiological analyses. Samples are sent to ITE Merlewood; two short cores and one long core per centre plot are collected and packaged for dispatch.
- Calluna sampling: within squares where Calluna vulgaris occurs; collect current year's growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight), seal in labeled bags, and dispatch to ITE Merlewood; includes procedures for random sampling, sample drying if needed, and tracking via envelopes.
- Freshwater sampling: coordinated with accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff; sampling occurs concurrently with field survey work but is conducted separately under IFE direction.
- Sampling logistics include precise labeling, packaging, and dispatch workflows to ensure sample integrity and traceability.

## Data capture and field documentation

- FABs consolidate data and maps for each square; sections cover ownership, physiography, inland water, vegetation, forestry, boundaries, buildings, and universal codes.
- Detailed guidance on recording new vs. old features, re-numbering parcels, and aligning FAB entries with corresponding theme maps to preserve temporal comparability.

## Photography and field documentation

- Each vegetation plot is photographed with one camera per team; print film is used, and photographs must include reference features that are obvious, permanent, and close enough for legibility.
- Photos must clearly display the square and plot numbers on a labeled board placed at the plot edge, with careful composition to minimize excessive sky capture.

## GPS data collection and metadata (Annex 1)

- Step-by-step GPS data collection guidance, including ensuring sufficient satellite availability (PDOP ideally below 6), and handling stationary vs moving data collection.
- File naming convention: each plot or feature must have a unique data file named with square number and plot/feature identifier (e.g., 501X4.PSE); includes explicit guidance for recording new features (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
- Instructions for data logging, data rate, feature naming, and options to expedite data entry via a reference sheet of plot identifiers.
- Battery management, almanac updates, and handling obstructions to optimize GPS accuracy.

## Data quality, integrity and post-survey procedures

- After each survey day, data sheets must be checked for omissions; data may be transposed only if absolutely necessary due to damage to original maps.
- FABs, samples, and related materials should be transported back to ITE stations promptly to preserve data integrity and enable timely processing.

## Metadata, provenance, and data sharing

- Strong emphasis on linking field observations to map features, maintaining traceability through parcel-related codes and parcel numbering changes.
- Documentation of data changes and the rationale behind changes to support auditability and reproducibility across survey years.
- Outputs include FAB-derived data, theme maps, BAP maps, ponds maps, and GPS geo-referencing annexes to support data sharing and reuse.

## Practical considerations for Data Stewards

- Ensure timely access to field data and maintain interoperability across multiple coding schemes, FABs, maps, and forms.
- Manage large volumes of square-level data with complex mosaics while preserving data lineage and change traceability.
- Align field collection practices with overarching reporting frameworks (Broad Habitats, Biodiversity Action Plans) while maintaining granular, plot-level data.

## Annexes and supplementary notes

- Annex 1: Detailed procedures for collecting and validating GPS data, including file naming, data logging, and equipment handling.
- Additional background on field sampling relevance to soil quality indices and long-term monitoring objectives.

## End-state and impact

- The CS2000 Field Handbook formalizes standardized, longitudinal field data collection across GB, enabling consistent trend analyses, policy evaluation, and biodiversity monitoring with explicit data provenance and interoperability considerations.
