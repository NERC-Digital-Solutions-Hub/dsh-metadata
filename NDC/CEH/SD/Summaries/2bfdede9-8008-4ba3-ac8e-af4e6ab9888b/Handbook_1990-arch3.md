# Countryside Survey 1990

- Aim and scope
  - Update and scrutinise environmental health measures to inform policy and future decisions.
  - Monitor changes in the rural environment and link ground-truth data with satellite/top-down data.
  - Two major GB surveys historically; 1990 resurvey to provide current datasets for scientific evaluation and trend detection.

- What the document is and how it’s used
  - Field handbook for conducting the Countryside Survey 1990, detailing objectives, methods, data collection, and data handling.
  - Outlines standardised procedures to ensure data quality, comparability, and transparency.

- Core elements of the survey design
  - Three basic elements: mapping, data recording (quadrats), and sampling.
  - Ground-truthing paired with remote sensing via a two-tier approach to enhance pattern detection and projection.
  - 512 sample squares planned; each square assigned to one of six ITE Research Stations; teams (~85 squares each); flexible scheduling with travel-based work to minimise overtime.

- Planning, permissions and logistics
  - Permissions from farmers/landowners required for access to all parts of each square; prior contact recommended but may cause delays.
  - Clear procedures for handling permission refusals, including abandoning a square or adjusting survey areas.
  - Emphasis on engaging with landowners for background information and cooperation.

- Equipment and data documentation
  - Equipment locally and centrally provided (FAB recording booklets, 1:10,000 aerial photos, maps, weatherproof clipboards, etc.).
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) compile data from mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; maps and FABs are central to data capture.

- Data recording, codes and metadata
  - FABs require structured data entry with primary and secondary codes; use of alpha codes to compactly represent code combinations; all features require a dominant primary code.
  - Rules for boundaries, non-existent features, and edge-coding; minimum mappable units; use of cross marks for point data and dotted lines for hints awaiting detail.
  - Aerial photography interpretation (API) supports feature identification and boundary delineation; guidelines for how API-drawn boundaries relate to on-ground data.

- Mapping and field procedures (6.1)
  - Mapping involves annotating enlarged maps with data codes to describe land cover, boundaries, and features; permanent markers are used to relocate plots over time.
  - API conventions include dashed boundary lines, crosses for isolated features, and diamonds for no longer present boundaries.

- Data recording and Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) specifics (6.1.2)
  - FABs must be completed neatly; include square series number on every page; use pencil where possible; map units defined by descriptive codes.
  - Detailed guidelines for recording ownership, farm/landowner information, physiography, inland water/coastal features, ground cover types, and species presence.
  - Instructions for complex mosaics: prioritize dominant cover codes; use X marks for point features; colour-coding as an alternative when number-coding is impractical.

- Vegetation sampling and plot types (6.2.2, 6.2.3)
  - Vegetation sampling uses two sizes of plots:
    - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots, plus additional nested 4 m2 plots; marked and relocated precisely; permanent metal plates used for relocation.
    - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots in different land-cover types within each square.
  - Laying out and recording follow strict procedures to ensure unbiased placement and consistent data capture; plots may be adjusted in linear features while maintaining documentation.
  - Linear plots include hedgerows (boundary plots), streamsides, and roadsides (with up to five plots per type per square); rules for placement, relocation, and measurement are defined (including 1 m width and distance from dominant features).
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots provide the baseline; relocation rules are applied when features change or no longer exist.

- Species identification, data handling and coding (6.2.5)
  - Emphasis on species-level recording where possible, with acceptable combinations for difficult identifications to maintain consistency with earlier surveys.
  - A predefined list of common crops, grasses, forbs, sedges/rushes, ferns, bryophytes, and lichens (with codes) to standardise data entry.
  - Use of 5% cover categories; three cover codes allowed per feature; thresholds (e.g., 25% cover for species coding) guide reporting.
  - Guidelines for age, canopy, and density coding in woodland/forest contexts; detailed codes for boundaries and management (e.g., hedges, fences, walls).

- Freshwater biota sampling (Section 7)
  - Two freshwater biota samples per square:
    - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (on behalf of IFE; described in a separate handbook).
    - Freshwater biota from standing waters (NELUP; water beetle-focused sampling).
  - Selection of standing-water sites aims to reflect two characteristic habitats within the square; samples preserved and transported to Merlewood.

- Photography and documentation
  - Photograph each vegetation plot to capture appearance and context; plot number and edge marker visible in photos.

- Post-survey procedures and data handling
  - End-of-day checks to ensure no features are omitted; temporary transcriptions discouraged unless necessary.
  - FABs and samples transported to ITE stations; standardized procedures to ensure data integrity and traceability.

- Data quality, governance and challenges
  - Standardisation to reduce observer variation across six stations; reliance on a Field Handbook as the central quality control mechanism.
  - Metadata and data-sharing requirements are implicit (public sharing of underlying data is a consideration and potential barrier).
  - Challenges anticipated include access limitations, data gaps, siloed data, metadata inadequacies, and the need for clear communication of complex findings.

- Outputs and coordination
  - Outputs include Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), maps, aerial interpretations, and photographic records; data are intended for ongoing monitoring, analysis of land-cover changes, and integration with bottom-up field data and top-down imagery.

- Contact and background
  - Background information and contact points provided (e.g., ITE, Merlewood Research Station) for the Countryside Survey 1990 context.
