# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Establishes standardized guidelines for CS2000 countryside surveys to collect, standardize, and compare land-use, habitat, vegetation, and landscape data over time.
- Aims to enable trend analysis and policy-relevant outputs, with emphasis on uniform data collection, quality assurance, and repeatability.
- Supports data use across topics and combines data into tools (maps, reports, dashboards) for end-users.

## Sampling framework and core design
- Survey area uses 1 x 1 km square sample units; CS1990 covered 508 squares; CS2000 expands to 568 with country allocations.
- Plans re-surveys of most CS1990 squares to maintain time-series and adds new squares for broader coverage.
- Module structure supports broad habitat, landscape features, and change detection; standardization reduces observer variation for robust long-term monitoring.
- Mapping emphasizes Broad Habitats with two tiers (Mappable vs Plottable) to balance detail with change-detection capabilities; upland vs lowland distinctions and alignment with UK Biodiversity Action Plans (BAP).

## Planning and site visits
- Six ITE research stations manage roughly 95 squares each; survey of a square typically spans multiple days.
- Flexible scheduling, route planning to minimize overtime, and consistent re-survey order for continuity with 1990.

## Equipment and field logistics
- Equipment provided and maintained; safety, identification, and loan processes defined.
- Key items include FABs, GPS, maps, field forms, safety gear, aerial photographs, cameras, markers, plotting equipment.

## General field survey procedures
- Two square types: old squares (re-surveys for changes since 1990) and new squares (stock of everything present).
- Upon arrival: assess access, obtain permission, plan routes for full coverage; review prior records.
- After recording: check for omissions and ensure data is clean and well-presented.

## Permissions and access
- Landowner consent required; pre-notified letters and local contacts kept up to date.
- If access is denied, procedures depend on whether the square is old/new and on which parts are inaccessible.
- If vegetation plots are denied, recordings are repositioned per guidelines; always attempt landowner contact before staff.

## Data recording and mapping (CS2000 approach)
- CS1990 mapped and sampled plants; CS2000 emphasizes change detection and broad-habitat reporting.
- Prioritizes mapping changes (i) change-only maps, (ii) broad-habitat reporting, (iii) enhanced upland/unenclosed habitat monitoring with additional plots.
- Broad Habitat reporting aligns with BAP; montane habitat mapping treated specially; two-tier mapping for upland vs lowland.
- Field codes: primary/secondary, plus universal codes; unique surveyor codes allowed but discouraged; standardization preferred.
- FAB organizes data into maps and data sheets; emphasis on neat, consistent data entry.
- Annexes cover GPS data collection and localization for accurate plot relocation and long-term repeatability.

## Plot types and data collection (CS2000 plotting framework)
- X PLOTS (LARGE, 200 m²): baseline species and habitat structure; nested 4 m² inner plots; permanent markers for relocation.
- Y PLOTS (SMALL, 2 x 2 m): five plots per square in various habitats; relocation and marking procedures described.
- U PLOTS (UNENCLOSED, 2 x 2 m): new plots in Plottable Broad Habitats; representative distribution across habitats.
- B PLOTS (BOUNDARY PLOTS, 10 x 1 m): focus on field boundaries; precise boundary positioning and marking.
- A PLOTS (ARABLE FIELD MARGIN PLOTS, 100 x 1 m): monitor arable weed communities; margins extended to 50 m.
- H PLOTS (HEDGEROW PLOTS, 10 x 1 m) and D PLOTS (HEDGEROW DIVERSITY PLOTS, 30 m): woody species, canopy structure, and diversity baselines; permanent markers.
- S & W PLOTS (STREAMSIDE, S1/S2; W1-W3): linear plots along water features; multiple plots per square to cover water-edge habitats.
- R & V PLOTS (ROADSIDE AND VERGE PLOTS): verge sampling across road types; records include verge type and edge habitats; relocation guidance for new squares.

## Data quality, codes, and outputs
- Emphasis on standardization to minimize observer bias; robust QA processes across observers.
- Detailed coding system (primary/secondary and universal codes) supports robust change detection and landscape reporting.
- BAP-based mapping and special handling for montane/upland habitats to reflect mapping complexity.
- GPS data collection annex enables accurate plot relocation and repeatability.

## Species data, bryophytes, and outputs
- Field forms include 200 common plant species; unlisted species may be recorded by scientific name.
- Bryophytes/lichens limited to a defined subset; plot-level biodiversity collected via nested plots with standardized 5% cover bands.
- Special handling for aggregations/complex taxa to maintain consistency with prior surveys.
- Clear guidance for translating CS1990 to CS2000 codes to ensure traceability of changes.

## Sampling sections (soil, Calluna, freshwater)
- Soil sampling (Section 10): CS2000 field surveyors collect five replicate soil samples per 1 km square (in each X-plot) for chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiology; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing/storage.
- Calluna sampling (Section 10.9): Within Calluna vulgaris areas, collect current-year growth shoots (CYG) for nitrogen analyses to assess nitrogen deposition impacts; samples posted to ITE Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11): Freshwater biota sampling may involve IFE staff; coordination with co-ordinators to schedule with ITE work.
- Equipment and packaging procedures specify how to label, package, and dispatch soil and Calluna samples (including envelopes, pipes, and shipping requirements).

## Photography and post-survey procedures
- Each team receives cameras; photographs document vegetation plots with reference features and plot identifiers on a marker board.
- Photos should be composed to emphasize the plot and identifiable reference features; minimize sky and ensure legible labeling for future visits.
- After survey: verify data sheets for omissions; avoid re-transcribing data unless necessary; transport FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.

## Annex: GPS data collection
- Step-by-step GPS workflow: battery checks, satellite visibility (minimum four), PDOP targets (<6 for 3D fixes), stationary vs moving logging, and unique file naming (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to associate data with specific plots.
- Logging controls, data rate, and stop/start procedures described; guidance for handling obstructions and antenna positioning.
- File naming and attribute lists aid rapid data entry and retrieval; guidance for recording new features and using the attribute reference sheet to speed identification.

## Outputs and long-term value
- The handbook supports consistent, repeatable data collection for time-series analysis, enabling robust trend detection and policy-relevant reporting.
- Standardized outputs (maps, plots, reports) facilitate cross-square comparisons and landscape-level insights while aligning with biodiversity planning frameworks.
