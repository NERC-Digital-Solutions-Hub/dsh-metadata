# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- A quality assurance (QA) study of the 1990 Countryside Survey to quantify accuracy of field recording and inform improvements for future surveys.
- Two QA phases were conducted:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 of the original survey squares; relied on sketch maps for plot relocation.
  - 1991: Extended QA with photographs of plots to assess improvement from photographic relocation and other refinements.
- Assessed components included plot relocation, species recording, land-use mapping, and vegetation cover estimation.

## Aims
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in 1990 and assess accuracy of change statistics.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, information type, and geographic factors like drought.
- Relate findings to previous ITE survey work.
- Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics in future surveys.

## Methods
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 squares, using original survey sketch maps for relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Included photographs of individual plots and a self-assessment component across 32 terrain classes; involved the same or similar assessor teams; 1 km square coverage.
- Plot types (six in total) assessed within each square:
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X plots) and 4 m2 (Y plots)
  - Linear plots including road verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries
- Plot relocation evaluation:
  - Located buried metal plates marking quadrat corners
  - Also relocated using sketch maps, photographs, and, where possible, a metal detector
  - Within-square relocation categorized as: plate and plot relocated; plate relocated but plot not satisfactorily located; plate not found
- Data collected at nine pre-determined points per quarter of a square (land cover and boundary features)
- Mapping and coding:
  - Primary land-use codes, secondary descriptive codes, and boundary codes
  - Nine-point location grid for vegetation and boundary features
- Data quality measures:
  - Species concordance: several indices (percentage agreement, agreement, accuracy)
  - Cover estimates for species recorded at both times
  - Mapping code concordance and efficiency

## Key Findings

- Overall concordance and accuracy
  - Autumn 1990 QA suggested lower agreement (around 45%) for initial comparisons.
  - Full 1990 QA results yielded a higher overall concordance of 60.9% (better than the autumn-only estimate) for species lists between times.
  - The initial efficiency of recording (1990) averaged about 74%, approaching a maximum of around 79% reported in other studies for standardized searches by experienced field workers.
- Changes in species recording and plot-level results
  - Across years, there was a notable increase in mean species per plot in 1991 QA compared with 1990 QA (e.g., all plots: 20.7 vs 23.4; X plots: 21.8 vs 24.3; Y plots: 16.9 vs 19.0; hedges, streams, verges, and boundaries similarly showed increases).
  - Seasonal and annual variation contributed substantially to changes in species composition; drought in 1990 and relatively normal growing season in 1991 affected detection and composition.
  - The 1991 QA suggested that about 27% of observed species increases could be attributed to greater recording efficiency, with the remaining ~73% attributed to real changes in species composition between years.
- Plot relocation and plot types
  - Photographs significantly improved relocation accuracy, particularly when trying to re-establish exact positions of plots (photographs vs sketch maps; plate-based relocation still useful but more time-consuming in unenclosed uplands).
  - Y plots (small 4 m2) were the most difficult to relocate accurately; X plots (larger 200 m2) were easier, especially roadside plots.
  - Suggestions to improve relocation included annotating photos and tying photo location to the plot with explicit distance and bearing data; use metal marker plates for X plots; adopt a survey-tape-based approach for 4 m2 (Y) plots with a fixed corner (SE corner) orientation.
- Mapping and land-use coding
  - Primary land-use codes generally reliable; minor categories (e.g., upland grassland subdivisions, moorland, bog) caused more variation.
  - Land-use mapping accuracy was high for lowland areas but more variable for upland/unenclosed vegetation, often due to location and interpretation challenges.
  - Boundary mapping concordance was good (around 80-83%), but more variation existed when comparing boundary types and hedges vs stockproof boundaries; Hawthorn-dominated hedges were particularly tricky.
- Species and cover data
  - Major species showed variable frequencies between years; some apparent changes reflected real population shifts (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Alliaria petiolata) while others were due to under-recording in the original survey (e.g., Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis).
  - Bryophytes and certain grasses were frequently misidentified or under-recorded; recommendations highlighted the need to improve vegetative identification training and bryophyte coverage in QA exercises.
  - The degree of concordance for species cover at fixed points varied: 81% for dominant species at a point, 34% for two co-dominants, and as low as 5% for three co-dominants.
- DecORANA analysis and ecological gradient
  - DECORANA first-axis scores indicated a gradient from shade-intolerant to shade-tolerant species, with uplands showing a distinct, stable vegetation pattern.
  - Across 1978, 1990, and 1991, axis shifts generally aligned with broader land-use trends, though some year-to-year variation suggests annual climatic effects, particularly in marginal areas.
- Land-use codes and boundary features
  - The primary land-use code approach was reliable, but mis-matches frequently occurred in boundary classification (e.g., hedges vs boundary types) and in the use of certain qualifying codes.
  - Recommendations emphasized simplifying mapping codes, subdividing some upland and lowland categories (e.g., upland grassland), and ensuring boundary coding is consistent (hedge codes limited to hedges; use qualifying codes for composition).
- Mapping of species cover
  - Point-by-point species cover concordance showed moderate to high agreement for dominant species, but much lower for co-dominants; mapping most prevalent species yielded higher reproducibility.
  - Recommendation to map only the two most prevalent species per land-use parcel to increase reproducibility and reduce ambiguity in coding.

## GIS and Mapping Implications for GIS Specialists

- Mapping accuracy is strong for primary land-use categories and boundary identification, but:
  - Unenclosed upland and marginal areas present greater uncertainty due to location and interpretation challenges.
  - Small plots (Y plots) are difficult to relocate; robust relocation aids (photos, markers, bearings) are crucial.
- Data standardization improvements
  - Increase the number of primary land-use codes and provide clear dichotomous decision tools to reduce ambiguity.
  - Limit the number of cover codes used in field mapping; focus on the most prevalent species to enhance reproducibility.
  - Restrict boundary codes to hedges with clear qualifying codes for composition to reduce misclassification.
- Data collection practices
  - Ensure photographs are annotated and linked to plot coordinates with distances and bearings; include time-synced field notes to minimize season-related discrepancies.
  - Use metal plates for plot corners where feasible, especially in enclosed land; plan for additional manpower in upland relocation to maintain efficiency.
  - For Y plots, position with a fixed orientation (N-S side orientation) and orient using a survey-tape method to improve accuracy.
- Seasonal consistency
  - QA should be conducted as near in time as practical to the original survey to minimize seasonal or annual variation effects.
  - When comparing change statistics, restrict comparisons to areas with similar land-use types and seasons.
- Bryophyte and vegetation identification
  - Strengthen training on bryophytes and grasses with similar vegetative characteristics; explicitly plan to include certain bryophyte species in QA and training.
- Data analysis and interpretation
  - Use robust approaches (e.g., DECORANA) to contextualize plot-level changes within broader ecological gradients; interpret axis shifts with caution given geographic and climatic variability.

## Recommendations (Key Actions for Future Surveys)

- Relocation and documentation
  - Photographs should be used to re-establish exact plot positions; annotate with distance bearings and link to the sketch map.
  - Maintain metal plates for X plots and improve relocation protocols for Y plots with a fixed, tape-based positioning system.
- Mapping codes and land-use taxonomy
  - Expand and refine primary land-use codes (including lowland rush pasture, upland grassland subdivisions, wet heath) and subdivide upland grassland categories.
  - Distinguish lowland moor/bog and wet heath clearly; restrict boundary coding to hedge identification with descriptive qualifiers for composition.
  - Reduce reliance on fine-grained cover codes; record only the most prevalent species to improve reproducibility.
- Data collection timing
  - Conduct QA in the same season and year as the original survey where possible; avoid cross-season comparisons to minimize seasonal variation.
- Training and species focus
  - Emphasize field characteristics that distinguish similar taxa (e.g., grasses) and bryophytes; include these species in training materials and QA exercises.
- Mapping accuracy and validation
  - Validate primary coding against independent checks; use point-by-point comparisons to gauge accuracy; focus on lowland vs upland discrepancies and provide targeted training.
- Reporting and transparency
  - Provide clear, actionable recommendations for data users on the limitations and expected accuracy of mapped data and species-collection results.

## Conclusion
- The QA exercise demonstrated meaningful improvements in relocation accuracy and species data quality when photographs and standardized relocation aids were used, though challenges remained for small plots (Y plots) and upland, unenclosed areas.
- Mapping codes showed generally high reliability for primary land-use categories, with more variability in boundary and minor categories; simplification and standardization of codes is advisable.
- Seasonal and climatic variations significantly affected species composition, underscoring the importance of year-matched QA and clearly defined seasonality considerations in future surveys.
- The study provides a comprehensive set of actionable recommendations to enhance GIS-ready data quality, including relocation practices, coding schemes, sampling strategies, and targeted training to improve reproducibility and usefulness of the Countryside Survey data for map-based analyses.
