# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose and scope
  - QA to assess consistency and reliability of the Countryside 2000 field programme amid multiple recorders.
  - Sample: 38 of 519 squares from 1998; in each, one quarter resurveyed, recording 234 species plots across nine plot types.
  - Aims: quantify field-recording accuracy; examine plot relocation efficiency; analyze observer/bias effects; relate CS2000 findings to CS1990; assess landuse mapping and change recording.

- Methods and design
  - Plot types: seven main CS2000 plot types, subdivided into quadrats and linear plots (including road verges, streamsides, boundaries, and arable margins).
  - Relocation and plate marking: attempted relocation of buried plates from 1990; used sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors.
  - QA exercise: 234 plots analyzed across 38 squares; 170 CS2000 plots and 210 QA plots evaluated for relocation, species concordance, and cover estimates.
  - Data analyses: assessed relocation success (plates and plots), species concordance (TI vs T2), vegetation cover, and change using DECORANA ordination; evaluated landcover and boundary coding (primary/secondary/cover codes, BAPs, and boundary features); examined changes in landuse and related coding accuracy.

- Plot relocation and plate/plot accuracy
  - Overall relocation success: 86.7% of full searches recovered; comparable to 1991 QA of CS1990 (87.1%).
  - CS2000 surveyors relocation: about 60% of 1990 plots accurately relocated; ~25% relocated with acceptable accuracy; ~15% inadequately relocated. Y-plots most difficult (23% failure).
  - Plate recovery by assessors (QA): ~69.3% of plates located; approximately 40–45% might be recoverable when counting probable category II cases.
  - Implication: eight-year relocation is feasible but less reliable than the one-year benchmark; some mis-location/orientation occurred (e.g., wrong bank/side of hedges, road verges).

- Species concordance and accuracy of records
  - Overall: around 73% initial accuracy for CS2000 species records; ~71% of records confirmed as present by assessors; ~2% non-concordances due to management/seasonal changes.
  - Comparison CS2000 vs QA: mean species per plot increased from CS2000 17.9 to QA 20.4 (difference highly significant, p < 0.001); QA produced longer species lists.
  - Across plots: TI vs T2 measures show that a substantial portion of mismatches reflect misidentifications, overlooked species, location/orientation errors, and changes due to management/season.
  - Allocation of variations (TI vs T2): major contributors include overlooked species (approx. 39.8%), orientation/location errors (about 10–11%), mis-identifications, and management/season effects.
  - Frequency changes: ranking of common species largely similar between CS2000 and QA; mosses often under-recorded; grasses frequently misidentified or over-recorded (Poa trivialis); species frequency does not always align with mean cover.

- Vegetation cover measurements
  - Cover estimates for principal species generally align between surveyors and assessors; some species show statistically significant differences (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum) but most grasses show reasonable agreement.
  - Overall cover concordance for species at landuse points ~63.0%; notable differences for some grasses and forbs reflect seasonality and identification ease.

- Landcover and boundary mapping
  - Primary landcover codes: high concordance between CS2000 and QA; excluding BAPs, overall primary land cover agreement ~87.5%; with BAPs included, concordance ~91.6% but BAP concordance ~77.4%.
  - Boundary and land-use qualifiers: primary boundary codes show strong concordance (~85.0% overall; code concordance ~92.0%). Boundary features (walls, hedges) show ~67.5% concordance with omissions contributing to errors.
  - Hedge shapes and codes: new hedge-shape codes were only modestly successful; many hedges captured under a small set of codes (e.g., box-shaped hedge).
  - Changes since 1990: mapping changes and boundary alterations show notable discrepancies; some changes recorded by CS2000 were not substantiated by QA (33.9%); many changes identified by QA were not recorded by CS2000 (14.7%); overall change concurrence ~51.4%.

- Change assessment and DECORANA ordination
  - Axis-1 changes indicate no directional bias between CS2000 and QA when aggregating by plot type; mean axis scores for CS2000 (387.8) and QA (392.0) show no significant difference (Bartlett p = 0.847).
  - For plot types and landclasses, no consistent directional bias detected; most discrepancies arise from plot location/orientation and cover-value differences rather than a systematic shift.

- Landuse and boundary change details
  - Change in landuse: 177 change instances analyzed; 16.4% concordant with assessor-reported errors/omissions in original survey; overall level of concordance in recording change ~51.4%.
  - Changes frequently involved crop/landuse changes, hedge types, or boundary alterations; in many cases, CS2000 did not reflect assessor-noted changes, suggesting potential under-recording of real changes.

- Arable margins and other plot types
  - Arable margin plots (few in sample): very low concordance; seasonality and unfamiliarity with ruderal species likely contributed to differences. Recommendation: consider multiple visits for arable margin plots to improve reliability.

- Annex and procedural notes
  - Annex B provides dates and efficiency measures; the QA protocol repeated original CS2000 procedures for point sampling and boundary features to ensure comparable coding and assessment.

- Overall interpretation for data-focused analyses
  - Data quality: CS2000 fieldwork demonstrates strong relocation capability and generally robust species concordance, with higher species lists in QA reflecting broader capture of taxa.
  - Key weaknesses: location/orientation errors, missed changes in landuse/boundaries, and some under- or over-recording of certain taxa (notably certain grasses and mosses).
  Data integration implications: fixation on exact plot replication is challenging over eight years; mapping and coding systems largely hold; however, change detection and boundary-change recording require cautious interpretation and possibly supplementary verification.

- Implications for future QA and data use
  - Maintain explicit recording of plot location/orientation errors and improve marker/plate recovery procedures.
  - Consider multiple visits for arable margin plots and targeted training on difficult taxa (mosses, certain grasses) to improve concordance.
  - Preserve robust mapping protocols; ensure boundary and hedge coding remains aligned with boundary changes to improve change detection.
  - When using CS2000 data for change assessments, treat change concordance as somewhat conservative given substantial under-recording potential in 1990-to-2000 transitions.
  - Documentation and accessibility: QA results (TI/T2, code concordances, and error categories) should be retained with metadata to support reproducibility and discoverability of datasets.
