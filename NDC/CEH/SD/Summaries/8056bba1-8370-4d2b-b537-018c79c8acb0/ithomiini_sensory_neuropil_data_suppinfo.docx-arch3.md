Neuropil volumes for sensory structures in ithomiini butterflies (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae, Danainae) forming a single community in eastern Ecuador

Overview
- Purpose: Dataset documenting neuropil volumes in sensory brain structures to understand how sensory environments shape investment in neural processing.
- Context: Builds on prior work (Montgomery & Ott 2015; Wainwright & Montgomery 2022; Wainwright et al. 2024) examining ecological influences on brain composition in mimetic butterflies.
- Scope: Wild-c caught ithomiine butterflies from a single community in eastern Ecuador (Yasuní region).

Field site, animal collection and identification
- Location: Estación Científica Yasuní, Parque Nacional Yasuní, Orellana Province, Ecuador (primary lowland Amazon rainforest; ~4.5 km2).
- Collecting periods and permits: 2011–2012 and 2022 with multiple collection/export permits issued to national authorities and PUCE, supported by Estación Científica Yasuní staff.
- Sampling and identification: Genera identified by wing venation and local race ID sheets; sexed; wing vouchers preserved; nonretained individuals marked before release to prevent resampling.

Sensory neuroanatomy measurements
- Specimens: 392 wild-caught individuals across 49 species; variable per-species sample sizes (28 up to 1 individual).
- Dissection and fixation: HEPES-buffered saline; zinc formaldehyde fixative; standardized handling and storage.
- Immunostaining: Synapsin antibody labeling (pre-synaptic marker) with a multi-day staining protocol; extensive washes and secondary antibody labeling.
- Imaging and 3D reconstruction: Confocal microscopy (488 nm) with 10x objective; anterior and posterior stacks merged in Amira; z-dimension corrected by a factor (1.52) to offset artifacts.
- Neuropil segmentation and volumes: Manual segmentation of five of six primary optic lobe neuropils (medulla, lobula plate, lobula, accessory medulla, ventral lobula) plus anterior optic tubercle and antennal lobe; lamina excluded due to fragility; some specimens lacked ventral lobula. Central brain volume estimated by including rest of central brain after subtracting primary neuropils and olfactory/central structures; all paired neuropils were doubled for analysis.
- Data processing: Volumes log10 transformed; central brain used as an allometric control by subtracting anterior optic tubercle and antennal lobe from total to compute “rest of central brain.”
- Outputs: Raw and log-transformed volumes for each structure; combined optic lobe volume (sum of targeted neuropils).

Quality control and data integrity
- QC criteria: Excluded damaged or poorly stained samples; multiple measures per species available; alignment with previously published methodologies (Montgomery & Ott 2016).
- Data provenance: Detailed collection metadata (Year, Individual ID, Subtribe, Species, Sex, Mimicry ring) and measurement metadata included.

Data structure and accessibility
- Columns and metadata: Year collected; Individual ID; Taxonomic data; Sex; Mimicry ring; log10 volumes for central brain, each neuropil (medulla, lobula plate, lobula, accessory medulla, ventral lobula, antennal lobe, anterior optic tubercle); log10 volume for the combined optic lobe and rest-of-central-brain control.
- Transforms and normalization: Log10 transformation; central brain volume context provided for allometric analyses.
- Provenance and licensing note: Dataset described as part of a broader research program; created under a NERC Independent Research Fellowship (NE/N014936/1).
