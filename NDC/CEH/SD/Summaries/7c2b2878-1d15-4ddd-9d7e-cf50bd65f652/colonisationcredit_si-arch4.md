# Supporting information for the flora survey data generated to test the colonisation credit of woodlands on the isle of wight

## Objective and study design
- Provides supporting information for flora survey data used to test the colonisation credit of woodlands on the Isle of Wight.
- Aimed at evaluating understory herb cover within woodland triplets to understand colonisation patterns.

## Sampling framework and methods
- Triplets of woodlands surveyed, each triplet including:
  - An ancient woodland
  - A recent woodland adjacent to the ancient woodland
  - A recent woodland of the same age and size but distant from the ancient woodland
- In each woodland, six systematic 1 m x 1 m quadrats were used.
- In each quadrat, the percentage cover of all understory herbs was estimated.

## Locations and coordinates
- A set of geographic coordinates are provided, representing sampling locations across the woodlands (coordinates presented as numeric pairs).

## Measurements and units
- Units represent the percentage cover within a 1 m x 1 m quadrat.
- Data capture focuses on the percentage cover of understory herbs per quadrat.

## Identification and quality control
- Plants identified using dichotomous keys.
- Percentage cover estimated by marking grids on the quadrats to aid estimation and accuracy.

## Data structure and format
- Data are organized as a matrix:
  - Columns represent species names.
  - Rows represent quadrats (nested within woodlands and within blocks of three woodlands per triplet).

## Data governance considerations for data leaders
- Clear structured design facilitates cross-woodland comparisons and integration into a broader data system.
- Geospatial coordinates enhance discoverability and potential integration with spatial analyses.
- Quality control measures (dichotomous keys and grid-based estimates) support data reliability and reproducibility.
- Metadata provided is limited to sampling design, coordinates, units, and data structure; potential gaps include collection date, observer identity, taxonomic resolution beyond species names, and contextual metadata (e.g., site conditions).
- Data stewardship considerations include ensuring updates, maintaining metadata standards, and documenting any data gaps or assumptions to support reuse and coordination across networks.
