# Supporting information for the flora survey data generated to test the colonisation credit of woodlands on the isle of wight.

## Aim
- Provide flora survey data to test the colonisation credit of woodlands on the Isle of Wight by analyzing understory herb cover across woodland types.

## Study design
- Triplets of woodlands surveyed: ancient woodland, a recent woodland adjacent to the ancient, and a recent woodland of the same age and size but distant from the ancient.
- Each triplet surveyed with 6 systematic quadrats per woodland.
- Within each triplet, woodlands are considered in blocks of three.

## Data collection methods
- In each woodland, 6 systematic 1 m x 1 m quadrats were used.
- For each quadrat, the percentage cover of all understory herbs was estimated.

## Measurements and units
- Unit of measurement: percentage cover for each 1 m x 1 m quadrat.

## Woodland coordinates
- Coordinates provided for the sampled locations (each representing a quadrat location within woodlands).
- Example coordinates listed as a set of XY values (units not specified here but correspond to quadrat positions within the study area).

## Quality control
- Plant identification performed using dichotomous keys.
- Percentage cover estimated by marking grids on the quadrats to guide consistent assessment.

## Data structure
- Data organized as a matrix:
  - Columns: species names.
  - Rows: quadrats, nested within woodlands and within blocks of three.

## Additional notes
- This dataset serves as supporting information for the flora survey data used to evaluate colonisation effects in Isle of Wight woodlands.
