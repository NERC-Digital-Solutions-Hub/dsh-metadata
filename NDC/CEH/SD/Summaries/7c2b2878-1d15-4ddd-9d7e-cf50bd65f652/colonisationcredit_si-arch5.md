# Supporting information for the flora survey data generated to test the colonisation credit of woodlands on the isle of wight

## Purpose and study design
- Provides supporting information for flora survey data used to test the colonisation credit of woodlands on the Isle of Wight.
- Design: triplets of woodlands surveyed with 6 systematic quadrats per woodland.
  - Each triplet contains: an ancient woodland, a recent woodland adjacent to the ancient, and a recent woodland of the same age/size but distant from the ancient.
- In each woodland, the percentage cover of all understory herbs was estimated.

## Spatial data
- Woodland locations are provided as coordinate pairs (Eastings/Northings) for multiple sites.

## Measurements and units
- Units: percentage cover within a 1 m × 1 m quadrat.

## Quality control and taxonomy
- Plant identification conducted using dichotomous keys.
- Percentage cover estimated by marking grids on the quadrats.

## Data structure and content
- Data organized as a matrix.
  - Columns: species names.
  - Rows: quadrats (nested within woodlands, within blocks of three).

## Metadata and data stewardship considerations
- The document records the study design, coordinates, units, identification methods, and data structure, enabling reproducibility and reuse.
- For data governance, ensure future metadata includes:
  - Accurate coordinate reference system for all woodland coordinates.
  - Dates of surveys and surveyors.
  - Clear labeling of quadrats and triplet grouping (ancient, adjacent recent, distant recent).
  - Taxonomic authorities used for species names.
  - Documentation of grids used for percent-cover estimation.
