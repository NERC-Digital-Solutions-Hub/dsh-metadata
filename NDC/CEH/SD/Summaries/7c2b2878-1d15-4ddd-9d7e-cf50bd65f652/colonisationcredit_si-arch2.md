# Supporting information for the flora survey data generated to test the colonisation credit of woodlands on the isle of wight

## Collection methods
- Triplets of woodlands were surveyed using 6 systematic quadrats in each woodland.
- Each triplet included: an ancient woodland, a recent woodland adjacent to the ancient woodland, and a recent woodland of the same age and size but distant from the ancient woodland.
- In each woodland, the percentage cover of all understory herbs was estimated.

## Woodland coordinates
- A set of 23 coordinate pairs is listed for the sampled woodlands:
  - (462171.2 87028.07)
  - (462173.6 86950.71)

## Units
- All units represent percentage cover of a 1 m x 1 m quadrat.

## Quality control
- Plants were carefully identified using dichotomous keys.
- Percentage cover estimated by marking grids on the quadrats.

## Data structure
- Data is structured as a matrix: columns are species names and rows are quadrats (within woodlands, within blocks of three).
