# Supporting information for the flora survey data generated to test the colonisation credit of woodlands on the isle of wight

- Aim and scope
  - Supporting flora survey data collected to test the colonisation credit of woodlands on the Isle of Wight.

- Study design and collection methods
  - Woodlands were surveyed in triplets: an ancient woodland, a recent woodland adjacent to the ancient woodland, and a recent woodland of the same age and size but distant from the ancient woodland.
  - In each woodland, the percentage cover of all understory herbs was estimated.
  - Six systematic 1 m x 1 m quadrats were surveyed per woodland.

- Sampling units and layout
  - Each quadrat provides a percentage cover for understory herbs.
  - Data structure treats each woodland triplet as a set, with quadrats nested within woodlands and within blocks of three (AW, adjacent recent, distant recent).

- Units
  - All measurements are percentage cover within a 1 m x 1 m quadrat.

- Quality control
  - Plant identification performed using dichotomous keys.
  - Percentage cover estimated by marking grids on the quadrats to ensure consistency.

- Data structure
  - Data are organized as a matrix:
    - Columns represent species names.
    - Rows represent quadrats (within woodlands, within triplets).
  - Each row/column intersection contains the percentage cover of a species in a given quadrat.
