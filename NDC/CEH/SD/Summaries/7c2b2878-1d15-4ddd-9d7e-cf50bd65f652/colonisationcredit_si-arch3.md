# Supporting information for the flora survey data generated to test the colonisation credit of woodlands on the isle of wight

## Purpose and scope
- Provides supporting data for evaluating colonisation credit of woodlands on the Isle of Wight.
- Focuses on flora survey data describing understory herb cover within a designed woodland sampling scheme.

## Sampling design and data collection
- Triplets of woodlands sampled: ancient woodland, a recent woodland adjacent to the ancient, and a recent woodland of similar age/size but distant from the ancient.
- In each woodland, six systematic quadrats were surveyed.
- In each quadrat, the percentage cover of all understory herbs was estimated.

## Study sites and coordinates
- Coordinates are provided for the sampled woodlands (a set of 1x1 km-scale points representing quadrat locations within the triplets).

## Measurements and units
- Units: percentage cover per 1 m x 1 m quadrat.
- Each quadrat yields a percentage cover value for the understory herbs present.

## Quality control and species identification
- Plants identified using dichotomous keys.
- Percentage cover estimated by marking grids on the quadrats to standardise assessments.

## Data structure and organization
- Data organized as a matrix: columns = species names; rows = quadrats.
- Hierarchy: quadrats within woodlands, within blocks of three (triplets).

## Relevance for monitoring and governance
- Provides a structured, quality-controlled dataset to assess woodland colonisation dynamics.
- Supports transparency in methodology and data presentation (clear units, identification keys, and data structure), aligning with monitoring framework needs for data usability and reproducibility.
