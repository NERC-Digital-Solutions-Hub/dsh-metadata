# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Approximate location (whether squares fall within predetermined areas) can be produced; four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square.
- Precise locations (six-digit grid references) require pre-processing by CEH to avoid release; in very exceptional cases, six-digit data may be released under licence if the requester demonstrates legally that their data/models carry equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- Four-digit releases have lighter IP/confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; both types include restrictions to prevent locating exact square locations.

## License terms and restrictions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the license period.
- At the end of a licence, organisations must confirm destruction of location data.
- No data or derivatives should be shared with third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP if requested.
- Four-digit releases have terms similar to six-digit releases but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences signed by an authorised senior official.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows Act and Regulations procedures to support the decision.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications for access, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH should be consulted before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH may provide pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes, particularly for internal CS partnership use.
- Requests from external organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Collaboration or payment with CEH for pre-processing or support is negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for potential users
- It is recommended to consult CEH early in the planning process to define requirements and the appropriate level of data access.
- Internal CS use may involve pre-processing support to enable data sharing without exposing precise locations.
- External users should expect a case-by-case assessment and must adhere to licensing terms, including destruction at the end of the project.
