# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Defines the CS2000 Countryside Survey methodology and field procedures for time-series land cover, landscape features, and vegetation data across Great Britain.
- Builds on CS1990 with aims to standardise data collection, enable repeat surveys, and provide datasets for policy, biodiversity monitoring, and research.
- Integrates ground-truth field data with remote sensing, supports cross-squad data comparability, and emphasises data provenance and discoverability.

## Sampling design and planning (Sections 10 and related)
- Three main sampling domains: soil, Calluna vulgaris foliar nitrogen, and freshwater biota (the latter by IFE staff).
- Soil sampling aims to establish baseline, spatially referenced soil data across 1 km squares; five replicate soil samples per square, collected within X-plots.
- Calluna sampling targets nitrogen deposition effects; samples collected within each square containing Calluna vulgaris, from current-year growth, and within random plants.
- Freshwater sampling managed by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff, coordinated with CS2000 field teams.

## Plot types and data collection (vegetation and habitat data)
- Plots are placed and relocated to support a nested, repeatable sampling framework:
  - X plots: large 200 m2 center-plot sampling with nested subplots for detailed vegetation data; permanent markers and GPS usage.
  - Y plots: small 4 m2 baseline vegetation plots for quick vegetation sampling.
  - U plots: unenclosed plots within Plottable Broad Habitats; up to 10 per square.
  - B plots: Boundary plots along field boundaries; focus on vegetation and boundary features.
  - A plots: Arable field margin plots along boundaries.
  - H plots: Hedgerow plots; assess hedgerow species and canopy.
  - D plots: Hedgerow diversity plots; woody species diversity along hedgerows.
  - S/W plots: Streamside plots (S) and water-edge plots (W) for aquatic transitions.
  - R/V plots: Roadside and verge plots; capture vegetation along roads and verges.
- Plot relocation relies on metal plates, ground plans, and GPS where possible; if a plate is missing, plots are relocated and re-marked.
- Within plots, vascular plants are inventoried with nested subplots; a standard list (top 200 species) is used, plus aggregated forms; bryophytes/lichens use restricted lists with set coverage values.
- Mosses/lichens and vascular plant coding schemes are designed to maintain comparability with CS1990 and allow mosaics and boundary details to be recorded precisely.

## Data recording and documentation
- Field data are captured primarily on Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) with structured pages for ownership, physiography, land cover, boundaries, and other metadata.
- Mapping and plotting codes are standardised; boundaries, boundary conditions, and changes over time are documented with detailed codes.
- Metadata and provenance are emphasised to ensure data sources, observer consistency, and discoverability of datasets via portals with metadata.

## Permissions, access, and logistics
- Landowner permissions are required for all parts of survey squares; access decisions can lead to abandonment or partial recording depending on denial extent.
- Data collection requires coordination across teams and institutions (ITE Merlewood for soil data; IFE for freshwater sampling); protocols for handling access denials and partial access are defined.

## Photography and post-survey procedures
- Photography: one camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and reference features; features must be obvious, permanent, and near the plot for future reference; photos include square/plot identifiers and are composed to show the plot with reference features.
- Post-survey: data sheets are checked for omissions; data may be transcribed to fresh maps only if necessary; FABs and samples are transported back to ITE stations promptly.

## GPS data collection and Annex 1 (Annex: GPS Data)
- Detailed GPS data collection procedures to improve plot relocation and mapping accuracy, especially in upland/unenclosed landscapes.
- Steps cover battery power, satellite counts, PDOP guidance (aim for PDOP under 6), stationary versus moving data collection, and file naming conventions.
- File naming: each plot/feature must have a unique data file (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4); logging procedures include start/stop commands and data-rate settings.
- Data management: almanac updates, handling obstructions, and template guidance for entering plot identifiers via Magellan keypad.
- Emphasis on creating site-specific data files and associating them with the correct square and plot.

## Data handling, quality, and discoverability
- Emphasises robust data management, traceability, and compatibility across surveys to enable reliable comparison over time.
- Metadata, data provenance, and portal-based discoverability are built into the workflow to support future analyses and modelling.

## Additional notes on vegetation coding and annexed content
- The document includes extensive annexed coding schemes for plant taxa (vascular plants, ferns, mosses/lichens), aligning with standardized nomenclature and facilitating consistent data entry and later translation to preferred taxonomic references. This supports the creation of coherent, comparable vegetation datasets across surveys.
