# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Aim and scope
- Document outlines sampling design, measurements, analysis considerations, and data handling for Countryside Survey (CS) soils across years 1978, 1998, and 2007.
- Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sampling design
- Soils sampled in three years: 1978, 1998, 2007.
- 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 CS squares; 2007 expanded to all 591 CS squares.
- Not all measurements were made on all samples in every year.
- Five x-plots per CS square; x-plots are not replicates due to heterogeneity (different land uses/soil types within a square).
- X-plots can be relocated over time (e.g., due to land access or destruction); each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Samples from the same identifier come from the same location, but exact sampling points may shift about 2–3 m around a fixed 2 m × 2 m plot.

## Sampling location and methods
- Soils collected from the CS x-plots; five x-plots per square, randomly positioned.
- Sampling depth: top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for the invertebrate sample).
- 1998 and 2007 used soil cores hammered into the soil; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Some soils could not yield a full core due to stones or shallow soils.
- In 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were recorded for 2 of the 4 cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

## Measurements and data collected
- 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
- 1990s onwards: multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements (Table 1); samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 (not by ISO bulk density method).
- No chemical analyses by soil horizons; overall soil analyses varied by core.
- A full description and implications are provided in Emmett et al. (2008).
- Table 1 (CS2007) includes measurements such as LOI, pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, and Metals.
- Coverage varied: some measurements applied to all 591 squares; others limited to the original 256 squares.
- Data release constraints: certain measurements released only after the Soils Report published November 2009.

## Statistical analysis considerations
- Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock/change of the population, while including them yields weighted national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not always used in CS soils analyses.
- The CS design typically uses a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots per CS square.
- For CS soils, spatial structure is not the primary interest; a dispersed set of observations increases regional precision and coverage.
- Analysts are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and to review CS publications available on the CS website.

## Data management and accessibility
- Datasets are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.
- Publications and methodological details are listed on the CS website and in Emmett et al. (2008).

## Implications for analysts monitoring the environment
- The CS soils dataset provides standardized, repeatable measurements across decades, enabling assessment of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Proper interpretation requires adjustment for sampling design (land classes, x-plots, square structure) and awareness of data release constraints.
- Collaboration with CEH is recommended to ensure appropriate methods and correct usage of the data.
