# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and site anonymity.
- All other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Keeps sampling sites representative and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Public interest justification; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When locations may be released (and precision)
- Access allows identification of whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to show approximate location.
- Six-digit grid references may be released only if pre-processing by CEH cannot meet needs, and in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, with proof that recipient data (IP) carries equal/higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats/linear features) carry location-identification risk and are governed by same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Licensing and conditions of release
- Licences preserve confidentiality, require secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences finite in duration and project-specific; data must not be retained for other duties.
- End-of-licence: written confirmation of destruction and continued data security.
- Prohibition on releasing data or derived information to third parties that could reveal square locations.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or assess landowner compliance.
- Licence applicants may need evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have a less stringent IP confidentiality bar than six-digit releases; four-digit data cannot be used to deduce precise locations.

## Data handling and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences and ensures clauses reflect policy; sign-off by senior authorised representatives.
- If approved, CEH issues licences and maintains compliance monitoring.
- If denied, decisions are supported by FOI/Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications and decision grounds.

## Practical guidance for users
- For internal CS partnership use, CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand.
- Requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- It is strongly recommended to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy to help define requirements and ensure appropriate use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## How this supports environmental monitoring
- Balances maximising public utility of spatial CS data with protecting sampling integrity and landowner cooperation.
- Enables targeted analysis at broader geographic scales while safeguarding exact locations needed for future surveys.
