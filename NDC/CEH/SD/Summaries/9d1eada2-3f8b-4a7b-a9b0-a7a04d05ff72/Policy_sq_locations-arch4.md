# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners listed (NERC/CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH).

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and securing future landowner permission for surveys.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Access can identify whether squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to indicate the 10x10 km grid location.
- Six-digit grid references require pre-processing by CEH to avoid direct release; exceptional external access may be granted if IP/data confidentiality criteria are met.
- Spatial data from within squares (maps of habitats/linear features) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional terms.
- Core principle: release must not enable easy identification of exact square locations and must avoid enabling visits or landowner monitoring.

## Specific licensing conditions
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to approved individuals for defined project purposes.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at project end.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; policy prohibits using data to visit CS squares or check landowner compliance.
- Potential licensees may need evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; eight use restrictions prohibit deducing exact locations.

## Responsibilities and processes
- CEH acts on behalf of NERC to make exceptional release decisions and issue hardcopy licences.
- CEH must sign licences with an authorized senior representative from the licensee organization.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations and provides rationale.
- CEH delivers an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS partner use, CEH aims to provide timely pre-processing support; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may provide scientific guidance or collaboration as appropriate, potentially on a paid or collaborative basis.
