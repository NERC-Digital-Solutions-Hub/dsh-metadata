# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Preserve scientific integrity of the sampling strategy and future permission to survey land.
- Disclosure could compromise future surveys and policy-relevance; handled under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access and release: when and how locations may be released
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to identify the grid square.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references may be released only under VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may pre-process to avoid release, and external release requires legal demonstration that IP/data confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, etc.) are treated with the same exceptional-criteria as six-digit references.
- Four-digit releases carry less stringent IP requirements than six-digit releases and must not enable precise square identification.

## Licence terms and conditions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to designated individuals for the approved project.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and confirmed destroyed at licence end.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Location data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- For four-digit releases, terms are similar but do not require the same high level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases.
- Licences for spatial data and four-digit references include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under FOI/Environmental Regulations processes.
- CEH will provide an annual report summarising applications and decision grounds.
- Internal CS partnership needs: CEH may provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case for external organisations.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before using CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
