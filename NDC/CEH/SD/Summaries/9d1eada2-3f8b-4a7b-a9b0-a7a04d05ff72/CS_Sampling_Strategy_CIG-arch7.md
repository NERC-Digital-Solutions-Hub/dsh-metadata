# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Outlines the sampling framework and land classification (ITE Land Classification) used to stratify field surveys for Countryside Survey in Great Britain from 1978 to 2007.
  - Connects historical methodology to current (as of 2007) GIS-ready data products, including map-based representations and country-specific estimates.

- Core concepts for GIS work
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
  - Use of a standardized Land Classification to define strata and to relate field observations to spatial units.
  - 1 km square sampling units, with center squares originally classified and surrounding squares linked by the classification key.
  - Land Classification built from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) and later refined with surrogates to cover all GB squares.
  - Outputs include land-class maps and survey-site locations that enable map-based analyses and change detection over time.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification (highlights)
  - Origin: Developed in the 1970s to stratify GB into discrete environmental classes for ecological surveying.
  - 32 classes initially (1978) based on environmental variables for 1228 core squares, with surrounding squares also classified.
  - 4-class surround approach: total ~6,040 classified squares used to derive class descriptions and area estimates.
  - 1984: Framework expanded to 384 squares across 32 classes; emphasis shifted to land use and landscape features.
  - 1990: All GB squares classified; land cover mapping linked; 508 squares surveyed; original classification revised to accommodate all squares (with some squares moved to neighboring classes).
  - 1998–2000: Further refinements to allow separate Scotland reporting; increased to 40 land classes; increased sample distribution to improve regional estimates.
  - 2007: Welsh-only reporting needs prompted subdivision of classes into country-unit versions and expansion to 45 strata; Wales received additional samples; England sampling adjusted accordingly; upland module added to bolster upland habitat estimates.

- Sampling framework by survey period
  - 1978 (Initial survey)
    - 32 Land Classes; 1 km squares centered classification; 8 samples per class; total 256 squares.
  - 1984 (Second GB land-use survey)
    - 12 squares per class (including 1978 squares); total 384 squares.
  - 1990 (All Squares land classification; CS1990)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Integration of the first Land Cover Map (from satellite data) for national estimates.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Separate country estimates implemented (England & Wales vs Scotland) with country-unit versions of Land Classes.
    - 40 strata created via subdivision/aggregation of classes; additional squares allocated to ensure representation of new classes.
    - Upland habitat module added to improve accuracy for uplands in England and Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements led to 5 new Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expanded total strata to 45.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares; some English classes were reduced to maintain balance.
    - Outputs reflect revised class maps and country-specific sampling frames (England-Wales and Scotland).

- Country-specific reporting and upland focus
  - England, Scotland, and Wales are treated with tailored sampling to support country-level estimates.
  - Wales required denser sampling and Welsh-class subdivisions to enable robust Wales-only reporting.
  - An upland module (CS2000) added targeted sampling in upland/marginal upland areas of England and Wales for improved habitat estimates.

- Outputs and GIS-relevant maps
  - Revised Land Class maps (England with Wales; Scotland) illustrating updated strata and classifications (Figures 4–6).
  - Maps of Countryside Survey sample squares (Figure 7 for the 2007 framework).
  - Tables detailing the distribution of squares by class and by survey year (e.g., per-class and per-country sampling counts in Tables 2–4 for various surveys).
  - The methodology links field observations to spatially explicit classes, enabling map-based habitat mapping, change detection, and policy-relevant reporting.

- National estimates and data harmonization
  - Two approaches for national estimates:
    - Use the latest classification (country-specific frameworks) for consistency within a survey.
    - Use the original 1990 Land Classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - The 2006 scoping work notes that changing the underlying classification impacts consistency of stock estimates; the preferred approach depends on whether consistency across surveys or within-survey consistency is prioritized.

- Relevance for GIS specialists
  - Provides a robust, stratified, geo-referenced framework for generating map-based habitat and land-use estimates across GB and its constituent countries.
  - Enables creation of country-specific map products and time-series analyses by linking 1 km square data to a standardized land-class schema.
  - Highlights the importance of class subdivision to meet policy- and jurisdiction-specific reporting needs (e.g., Wales-only reporting) and the implications for spatial data accuracy and representation.
  - Demonstrates integration of field survey data, land-class maps, and upland habitat modules into a cohesive GIS-ready dataset suitable for policy, planning, and public mapping applications.
