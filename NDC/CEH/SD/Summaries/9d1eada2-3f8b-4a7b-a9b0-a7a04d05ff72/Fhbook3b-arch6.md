# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Provides standardised methods for the Countryside Survey 2000 data collection across Great Britain.
- Aims to support time-series consistency, data quality, and linkage of field data to policy-relevant biodiversity and land-use indicators.
- Targets broad data use across topics and supports a range of organisations.

## Scope and aims of CS2000 data collection

- Re-surveys core CS1990 squares and adds new sampling to extend spatial and habitat representation.
- Produces national-scale, spatially referenced data for biodiversity, land cover, and habitat indicators.
- Emphasises standardised data gathering, change detection, and integration with existing land classification systems.

## Sampling framework and coverage

- Core sample: 508 squares (with replacements/additions) forming 37 strata; planned GB coverage up to 568 squares.
- Countries represented with upland additions; field teams organised around six ITE Research Stations.
- Typical field effort: about four days per square.
- Flexible planning to minimise site revisits; requires landowner permission and predefined procedures for refusals.

## Planning, field logistics, and permissions

- Emphasis on advance permissions, access checks, and on-site route planning.
- Pre-notification to landowners; manage access issues with defined procedures.
- On-site checks confirm access and full-square routes before starting.

## Equipment and field tools

- Centralised provisioning of equipment; Station-level oversight.
- Key items: Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), maps, GPS, aerial photographs, marker plates, survey poles, safety gear.
- Clear emphasis on equipment care, safety, and traceable plot markers.

## General field survey procedures

- Two square types:
  - Old squares: document changes since 1990.
  - New squares: record vegetation and features de novo.
- Plotting and mapping across landscapes with strict boundary delineation and access considerations.
- Consistent recording order and thorough field checks to reduce omissions.

## Data recording and mapping

- FABs consolidate data and maps for each square; require neat, unambiguous completion.
- Core data elements include land use, access permissions, physiography, water features, vegetation, boundaries, and buildings.
- Species lists prioritise a standard core (200 species) with Latin names for unlisted taxa; 5% cover estimation; tree metrics recorded where applicable.
- Coding uses CS1990 codes with CS2000 refinements; includes primary/secondary codes, colour conventions, and flexible universal codes.
- Change-tracking for old squares via parcel-based coding; new parcels document changes, splits, amalgamations, or habitat migrations.
- Mapping focuses on three thematic maps (Physiography, Agriculture/Vegetation, Forestry/woodland/trees) plus habitat-specific overlays (BAP, ponds).

## Plot types and data collected

- X plots: 200 m2 main plots with nested subplots for vegetation and cover.
- Y plots: five 2 m x 2 m plots for semi-natural baseline vegetation data.
- U plots: up to 10 plots in Plottable Broad Habitats; 2 x 2 m plots.
- B plots: boundary plots along field interfaces to monitor edge changes.
- A plots: arable field margin plots for weed dynamics.
- H and D plots: hedgerow structure/diversity plots.
- S & W plots: streamside and waterside plots along water bodies; optional inner plots for aquatic vegetation.
- R and V plots: roadside and verge vegetation plots with stratified positioning.
- All plots are permanently marked, GPS-enabled where feasible; relocation procedures documented for old plots.

## Vegetation recording and species data

- Core species list of 200; unlisted taxa named scientifically where possible.
- Cover estimated in 5% increments; trees recorded with canopy and height data where relevant.
- Bryophytes/lichens tracked from predefined lists; combinations allowed for difficult taxa.
- Supporting evidence: photographs and sketch maps accompany field data.

## Boundaries, buildings, and man-made features

- Extensive coding for boundaries, hedges, walls, fences, banks, and associated features.
- Hedge management status and hedge-shape coding used to aid interpretation.
- Documentation of buildings, roads, tracks, verges, and other curtilage features with standardized codes.

## Data quality control and standardisation

- Emphasis on standardised observer training and consistent field handbook use.
- Integrated consistency checks to improve accuracy of change data.
- Annexes provide mapping between CS1990 and CS2000 habitat codes; Montane categorisation handled via de novo mapping.

## Change detection and data management

- Old-square change mapping distinguishes mappable broad habitats from plottable habitats.
- Uses “Mappable BAPs” and “Plottable BAPs” to track time-series changes.
- Parcel-based numbering and cross-referencing capture mosaics, splits, and new features.
- Ponds and erosion treated as special themes with consistent conventions.

## Outputs and documentation

- Outputs feed national-scale analyses and policy indicators (biodiversity action plans, habitat assessments, land-use change).
- Deliverables include updated land-cover maps, broad habitat tallies, and time-series data across core and extended squares.
- Comprehensive documentation (FAB guidelines, site notes, data-entry rules) to ensure cross-observer consistency.

## Annex: GPS data collection

- Protocols for relocating plots, marking plot centers, and integrating spatial coordinates.
- Step-by-step guidance on GPS operation, satellite checks, data file naming, sampling rate, and logging.
- Emphasis on achieving reliable GPS fixes (PDOP < 6 preferred) and managing obstructions.
- Details on battery management, almanac updates, and recommended equipment setup for field logging.

## Section 10 – Sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater)

- Three sampling types: soil, Calluna foliar nitrogen, freshwater biota; soil/Calluna by field teams, freshwater by Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff.
- Rationale: establish baseline soil quality and biota indicators for national monitoring.
- Soil sampling: five replicate cores per X-plot (center 2 x 2 m plot), with specific pipe-based methods and mail-back packaging to ITE Merlewood.
- Calluna sampling: random selection of current year growth; 30–50 g fresh weight per square; standardized bagging and despatch.
- Freshwater sampling: coordinated with IFE staff; sampling occurs concurrently with field survey where possible.
- Packaging and despatch: explicit envelope/pipeline handling, return receipts, and regional coordinator collection.

## Section 11 – Photography

- One camera per team; photographs of every vegetation plot with reference to landmarks and square/plot identifiers.
- Use of a permanent reference board displaying square/plot numbers; avoid excessive sky in frames.
- Photographs provide ground-truth context and support later data processing.

## Section 12 – Procedures after survey

- Post-survey data checks to ensure nothing has been omitted; re-transcription only in exceptional circumstances.
- Transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

## Annex – Collecting GPS data (detailed)

- Battery management, satellite checks, stationary vs moving position logging, and file naming conventions.
- Keyword-driven attribute and plot-name selection; logging controls and data rate settings.
- Guidance for overcoming obstructions and using GPS features to maximize data quality.
