# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides standardized field methods for sampling environmental health indicators across Britain as part of CS2000.
  - Integrates soil, vegetation (Calluna and other flora), and freshwater biota sampling within a national framework.
  - Supports baseline data collection, time-series analysis, and policy-relevant monitoring.

- Types of sampling (Section 10)
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling (nitrogen-related analyses)
  - Freshwater biota sampling (coordinated with Institute of Freshwater Ecology)

- Background and rationale for soil sampling
  - Responds to Royal Commission guidance on soil sustainability and the need for baseline data to develop indices of soil biological activity and diversity.
  - Aims to establish a national, spatially referenced soil dataset in CS2000 using the same 1978 survey squares to ensure representativeness across ITE Land Classes and Land Cover types.

- Soil sampling protocol
  - In each 1 km square, five replicate soil samples collected for:
    - Soil chemistry analyses (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals)
    - Soil fauna diversity assessments
    - Soil microbiological status
  - Samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing and storage.
  - Core design: three soil cores per X-plot per square (two short white pipes and one long black pipe), collected at specified distances from the centre plot.
  - Handling and transport: short pipes shipped by post in pre-labeled envelopes; long pipes retained for regional coordination collection.

- Calluna sampling (section 10.8–10.10)
  - Purpose: to relate Calluna foliar nitrogen to deposition data and identify regions with deposition exceeding critical loads.
  - Within every 1 km square containing Calluna vulgaris:
    - Collect CYG (current year growth) Calluna shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants.
    - Properly label, bag, and despatch samples to ITE Merlewood; follow posting procedures or station-based despatch.

- Freshwater sampling
  - Conducted by specially trained IFE staff, in coordination with CS2000 field teams to occur concurrently in square timetables.

- Equipment and distribution
  - Standard CS2000 field equipment plus items specific to soil sampling (cool box, trowel, various pipes, aluminium plates, lump hammer, etc.).
  - Distribution managed by regional coordinators with labeled envelopes, pipes, end caps, and spare supplies to ensure proper sample handling.

- Detailed soil sampling procedure (centre plot methodology)
  - In each X-plot (2 x 2 m centre plots):
    - Locate the north corner and mark the point 15 cm north for the long black pipe sample; extract to >5 cm depth.
    - Use a short black/long pipe procedure to extract three separate soil cores, one at each of the specified offsets (north, east, west of the centre point).
    - Place soil into labeled bags, seal, and post or courier to the appropriate facility; keep samples in cold conditions as required.
  - Instructions emphasize careful labeling, record-keeping of any site issues (e.g., tree roots), and timely post/supply logistics.

- Collection of Calluna samples
  - Label bags clearly, select CYG Calluna shoots, collect 30–50 g fresh weight, and seal without excessive compression.
  - Despatch to ITE Merlewood via recommended routes; keep receipts for T&S claims if posting directly.

- Data handling and post-survey procedures
  - After survey days, check all data sheets for omissions; avoid transcribing data onto new forms unless essential.
  - Transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly to ensure timely processing.

- Photography (Section 11)
  - Each vegetation plot photographed using standard practices to document appearance and reference features.
  - Photographs must include plot and square identifiers on a visible board; composition should emphasize the plot with recognizable reference features.

- Procedures after survey (Section 12)
  - Review data sheets for completeness before leaving the field.
  - If needed, data can be transcribed to alternative maps/forms only in exceptional circumstances.
  - Arrange return of FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.

- Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data
  - Pre-checks: ensure GPS has sufficient satellites (PDOP ideally below 6 for 3D fixes).
  - Record stationary positions (plots) and moving features (boundaries) with defined data file naming conventions.
  - File naming: each plot/feature must have its own file name, e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4; for new features, include a reference such as 501F1.MOB.
  - Step-by-step logging: select plot IDs via an attribute reference, start/stop logging, monitor T (time), L (elapsed time), and C (longest continuous logging).
  - Battery management, almanac updates, PDOP considerations, and obstruction troubleshooting (e.g., elevating the aerial when blocked by trees/hedges).
  - Guidance on using the Magellan keypad and ensuring unobstructed sky views for accurate readings.

- Attribute reference and plot coding
  - Extensive attribute reference lists and mapping to plot identifiers (e.g., D1, X1, Y1, etc.) to facilitate quick data entry.
  - Cross-references exist between plot identifiers, feature types, and corresponding survey codes to support standardized data capture.

- Flora, mosses, and lichens coding (field vocabulary)
  - CS2000 provides standardized abbreviations for ferns, forbs/woody species, and mosses/lichens with Latin-name crosswalks to support consistent vegetation recording.

- Endnotes on data standards and governance
  - Emphasis on producing comparable, quality-assured datasets suitable for time-series analysis and policy-relevant monitoring.
  - Clear guidelines on data handling, metadata, and reproducibility to support long-term monitoring objectives.
