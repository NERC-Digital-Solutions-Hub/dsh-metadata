# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Purpose of the document: Describe the sampling design, locations, methods, measurements, statistical analyses, and data considerations for soil monitoring within the Countryside Survey (CS) framework, enabling assessment of environmental health and informing policy-driven decisions.

## Sampling design

- Sampling years: 1978, 1998, and 2007.
- Square coverage: 256 squares in 1978 and 1998; expanded to 591 CS squares in 2007.
- Power analyses: Conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (referenced in Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sample location and plot structure

- Sample units: Soils are collected from CS x-plots within each CS square, with 5 x-plots per square.
- Replication: The x-plots within a square are not replicates and may differ by land use and soil type.
- Relocation: Some x-plots are relocated over time due to land use changes, access, or safety concerns.
- Repeat identifiers: Each location has a unique repeat ID (e.g., 2RPT1) to track locations over time.
- Spatial sampling within plots: Within each square, sampling occurs around a permanently marked 2m x 2m plot; location shifts are typically 2–3 meters between samplings.

## Sampling (field collection)

- Depth: Soil is collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- Methods by year:
  - 1998 and 2007: Soil cores hammered in and extracted.
  - 1978: Soil pit dug with soil collected from the top 15 cm in the pit side.
- Practical constraints: Some cores could not be fully collected due to stones or shallow soils.
- Core documentation: In 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were recorded for 2 of the 4 cores.

## Measurements and laboratory analyses

- 1978 laboratory measurements: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
- 1990: Some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: Multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (as detailed in Table 1).
- Chemical analyses: Not performed by soil horizons; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
- Bulk density: Measured in 2007 (not via ISO bulk density method due to practical constraints).
- Data content (examples from Table 1): pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and other core-specific measurements.
- Data release: Some measurements released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.

## Statistical analysis and interpretation

- Accounting for structure: Analyses should consider land class structure; without adjustment, results reflect stock and change of the population rather than national estimates.
- Weighting and estimation: If land classes are incorporated, results become weighted national estimates of stock and change.
- Bootstrapping: Not consistently used across analyses.
- Experimental design considerations: CS uses a random/dispersion-based approach rather than a focus on spatial structure; a mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to account for multiple x-plots per square.
- Data usage guidance: Users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis, and to review published CS data exploiting previous outputs (listed on the CS website).

## Data availability and dissemination

- Data scope: Represents 591 CS squares in 2007 (and earlier years with smaller coverage).
- Access considerations: Some measurements were restricted or released later (post-2009 Soils Report).
- Documentation and references: Method development, power analyses, and protocols are detailed in Emmett et al. (2008); full data and methodological context are available via the CS website and related publications.
