# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides comprehensive, standardized guidance for CS2000 fieldwork across GB to monitor land cover, landscape features, and vegetation.
  - Supports national policy, biodiversity objectives, and sustainable development indicators through time-series data and linking to remote sensing and GPS where relevant.
  - Emphasizes standardization, traceability, and integration of multiple data streams (mapping, plots, vegetation, photographs, and GPS).

- Data governance and data models
  - Core data capture is organized around Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) with structured mapping, plots, and sampling data.
  - Standardized mapping and coding framework (primary/secondary codes) to enable cross-observer comparability and long-term consistency.
  - Parcel-based data lineage with old CS1990 references and new CS2000 parcel numbers; dedicated BAP mapping for different habitat types (Mappable vs. Plottable Broad Habitats).
  - Data linkage and metadata: changes documented with cross-references between old/new parcel numbers, descriptions, and BAP codes to ensure traceability over time.
  - GPS integration as an augmenting data stream (Annex 1), with procedures to capture location data and link to plots.

- Field procedures and data collection
  - Square management and field operations designed to balance old (change-focused) and new (baseline) squares.
  - Multiple plot types for vegetation sampling and habitat characterization, including X (Arealthy/Wally), Y, U (upland/unenclosed), B (boundary), A (arable margin), H (hedgerow), D (hedgerow diversity), S/W (streamside/river verge), R/V (roadside/verge), among others.
  - FAB structure covers ownership, physiography, agriculture/natural vegetation, boundaries, buildings, and canopy or boundary conditions; uses extensive alpha-numeric coding for land cover, boundary types, and canopy attributes.
  - Plot relocation protocols use physical markers, photographs, and field plans to ensure consistent placement; reloca­tion notes and new plates are recorded when necessary.
  - Data quality and standardization emphasize neat, complete FABs, legible entries, and explicit handling of atypical categories with qualifiers.

- Sampling and ancillary data
  - Soil sampling program (Section 10. Samplings) includes five replicate soil samples per 1 km square in CS2000 to support soil quality indices; sample collection, packaging, and shipment procedures are detailed.
  - Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling to assess nitrogen deposition impacts, with defined random sampling within squares and standardized handling for drying and shipping.
  - Freshwater sampling coordinated with IFE staff to avoid conflicts and ensure synchronized data collection.
  - Photography (Section 11) requires photos of every vegetation plot with reference features, including plot and square identifiers on a visible board; guidelines for composition and reference features to ensure long-term comparability.

- Data products, change management, and documentation
  - Shift from de novo mapping to change-focused mapping for old squares, with parallel BAP mapping for plottable habitats.
  - Base OS maps used with theme maps for Physiography, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Forestry/Trees, Boundaries, and Buildings/Structures/Communications; separate BAP map for plottable habitats.
  - Data recording forms capture CS1990 parcel codes, CS2000 primary codes, and descriptive fields; changes are documented to maintain continuity across time.
  - Emphasis on field-based decision making, management of mosaics and extent changes, and robust metadata for traceability across surveys.

- Permissions, access, and governance
  - Landowner consent required for all surveys; documented access status guides survey planning (abandon square if access is wholly refused; adapt survey if partial access is granted).
  - Documentation of access decisions and landowner information to inform future survey efforts.

- Annexes and special features (implementation details)
  - Annex 1: GPS data collection guidance, including power management, satellite checks, stationary vs. moving position logging, file naming conventions, sampling rates, and post-processing notes.
  - Ponds maps and Lowland Pond Survey alignment; examples of codes, boundary illustrations, and field procedures to support consistent data capture.
  - Detailed procedures for GPS file naming, feature recording, and data logging to ensure interoperability with the CS2000 data model.

- Key takeaways for Data Stewards
  - CS2000 delivers a rigorous, standardized framework for long-term countryside data with a strong emphasis on provenance, traceability, and time-series integrity.
  - Governance relies on clear data models (FAB structure, parcel numbering, primary/secondary codes, BAP mappings) and comprehensive change documentation to enable reliable cross-year analyses.
  - Consistent field methods, training, and audit trails reduce observer-induced variation and support data quality.
  - Proper permissions and landowner engagement, along with integrated data streams (mapping, plots, species lists, photos, GPS), create coherent, queryable datasets suitable for policy and biodiversity assessments.
  - The methodology distinguishes between change-focused monitoring of old squares and baseline establishment for new squares, with nuanced handling of upland versus lowland habitats through Mappable vs. Plottable Broad Habitats.
