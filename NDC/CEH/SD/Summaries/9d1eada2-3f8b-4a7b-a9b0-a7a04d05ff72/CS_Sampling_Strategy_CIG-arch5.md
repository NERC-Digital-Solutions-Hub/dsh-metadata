# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the development of the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Builds on a 30-year time series of ecological surveys; the sampling framework is tightly linked to the ITE Land Classification.
- Emphasizes the need to understand historical concepts to interpret current and future data and changes.

## Core concepts and rationale
- Stratified sampling to ensure representativeness and reduce bias, using objective random selection within strata.
- ITE Land Classification as the basis for stratification, combining environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) to define land classes.
- Use of 1 km square sample units (with surrounding squares) to balance survey practicality and ecological detail.
- National estimates derived from class-level means multiplied by class land area; time-series estimates depend on consistent classification and sampling.

## Evolution by survey year

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - 32 land classes derived from environmental variables for 1228 central 1 km squares; four surrounding squares also classified.
  - Final stratified, random sample: 256 squares (8 per class).
  - National habitat area estimates calculated from class proportions and mean habitat area per square.

- 1984 – Second Field Survey
  - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Continued use of the original 1978 Land Classification; results published later.

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to encompass all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - First linkage to the National Land Cover Map from satellite imagery.
  - Additional squares allocated to larger land classes; features recorded from CS1984 plus repeat vegetation quadrats.

- Post-1990 – Land Classification Refinement
  - Recognized need to classify every GB square; developed surrogate variables and tested multiple classification methods.
  - Best match to the original classification achieved 62% correspondence, with non-matching squares generally falling into neighboring classes; maintained usefulness for regional estimates.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Addressed policy needs for separate England & Wales and Scotland estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided to create country-unit versions; total strata increased to 40.
  - 19 additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; balancing squares across England and Wales.
  - Wales-specific refinements (including sub-division of Land Class 17) to improve Wales reporting; adjustments made for Isle of Man.
  - Upland habitat module added to improve accuracy for upland estimates in England & Wales.
  - Large table (Table 2) summarizes the GB-wide and country-level sampling changes and rates.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Further Wales-focused planning; devolution increased demand for Wales-only reporting.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit variants (creating five new Welsh/England-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expanded to 45 strata.
  - Additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure six squares per Welsh class; English classes adjusted (some with four squares per class) due to the Wales-focused sampling emphasis.
  - England, Wales, and Scotland sampling maps provided to illustrate revised framework and square distribution.

## Upland module and country-specific estimates
- Additional 30 upland squares in England & Wales to improve habitat estimates in upland regions.
- Adjustments implemented to support Wales-only and Scotland-only reporting, with revised country-specific sampling distributions and class maps (England with Wales and Scotland maps).

## Outputs, data handling, and comparability
- Repeated field surveys generated time-series data on habitat areas, land use, and landscape features.
- National estimates computed using class-level means multiplied by class area; cross-year comparability hinges on consistent Land Classification versions and stratification.
- Documentation, maps, and appendices (including an Appendix with a Brief History of the ITE Land Classification) accompany the strategy to support data provenance and reproducibility.

## Data governance implications for Data Stewards
- Provenance and versioning
  - Multiple versions of the ITE Land Classification across CS1978–CS2007; maintain explicit links between datasets and the classification version used.
  - Note that classification changes affect comparability of national estimates, requiring careful handling for time-series analyses.

- Metadata and documentation
  - Comprehensive methodological documentation, including class descriptions, sampling frames, and module details (e.g., upland module).
  - Availability of figures, tables, and appendices to support data interpretation and reuse.

- Data storage and sharing
  - Need to store per-survey data alongside their corresponding Land Classification maps and country-unit definitions.
  - Facilitate country-specific analyses (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales-only reporting) through clear class sub-divisions and sampling allocations.

- Data quality and limitations
  - Acknowledge under-representation in certain classes and the rationale for adding squares (e.g., to improve Wales coverage or upland estimates).
  - Document sampling rates and their impact on precision; include notes on changes in Wales/England allocations.

- Interoperability and integration
  - Alignment with satellite-derived Land Cover Maps and evolving Land Classification schemes.
  - Maintain interoperability across years by recording class definitions, splits, and aggregations.

- Access and reproducibility
  - Provide detailed methodological references and data dictionaries to enable replication of national and country-specific estimates.

## Challenges highlighted
- Balancing representation across many classes while meeting country-specific reporting needs.
- Adapting the sampling framework to devolution (England, Wales, Scotland) and to policy-driven reporting requirements.
- Managing changes in land classification over time and ensuring time-series comparability.
- Ensuring timely data collection and consistency across multiple data systems and formats.
