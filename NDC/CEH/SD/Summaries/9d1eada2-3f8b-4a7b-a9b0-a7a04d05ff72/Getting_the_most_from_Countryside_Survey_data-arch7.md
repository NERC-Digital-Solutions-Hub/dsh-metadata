# Notes on the downloadable data

- Precision and confidentiality: The exact locations of Countryside Survey (CS) survey squares are kept confidential by CEH to preserve representativeness; external users cannot identify whether squares fall within defined areas to a precision finer than 100 square km.
- Structure of CS field data: Data come from a sample of 1 km squares across Great Britain. Each selected square is mapped and detailed measurements are taken, with two levels of sampling—whole square and within-square—covering a range of variable types from binary to continuous.
- Non-random, stratified sampling: Sampling is not a random subset; it is stratified by the ITE Land Classification. The land-class classification has evolved (32 classes originally; 42 in 1998; 45 after 2007 Wales reporting), resulting in country-specific classifications (England: 21, Wales: 8, Scotland: 16).
- Representativeness and exclusions: Official estimates cover only squares meeting inclusion criteria. Squares with >90% sea or >75% urban area (per 1:250000 OS maps) were excluded from field surveys. Extrapolation to GB or regions assumes similar vegetative land composition in excluded squares, which is generally minor but can bias regions with many sea/urban squares.
- Estimation methods: Estimates by land class are calculated as ratio estimates, weighted by the vegetative land area in each land class. From 1998 onward, standard errors and confidence intervals are estimated using bootstrap methods due to skewness concerns.
- Practical implications for GIS work: When using CS data for map visualisations or analyses, use aggregated land-class estimates with appropriate area weights, and account for stratification and the sampling design. Be cautious about interpreting results that rely on unsampled or excluded squares; rely on bootstrap-based uncertainty where available.
