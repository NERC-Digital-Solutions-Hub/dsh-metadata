# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Field handbook for countryside survey data collection, enabling GIS-ready, spatially explicit datasets.
- Covers vegetation, soils, and freshwater sampling, with procedures designed to support national-scale analysis and policy-relevant GIS outputs.
- Emphasises standardized methods, traceability, and integration of field data into GIS workflows.

## Vegetation and Taxon Coding (GIS-ready)

- Comprehensive coding framework for vegetation, including ferns, forbs/woody species, and mosses/lichens.
- Uses standardized abbreviations and codes to represent taxa and taxa combinations, enabling consistent GIS attribute capture across plots.
- Example structure:
  - Ferns and related taxa linked to alternative scientific names (e.g., Athyrium filix-femina mapped to alternative codes).
  - Forbs/woody species entries with cross-references to preferred taxonomic names.
  - Mosses/lichens section with coded lists for rapid field entry.
- Annexed reference and sheet formats provide quick entry methods and ensure consistency in attribute Capture.

## Sampling Framework and Data Collection (GIS workflow)

- Three sampling types within CS2000:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna sampling (heather)
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by accredited IFE staff)
- Objective: create a national, spatially referenced dataset capable of supporting soil quality indices and vegetation analyses.
- Field-to-Lab path: samples collected in the field, shipped to ITE Merlewood for processing, with strict timing to preserve sample integrity.

## Soil Sampling (Procedure and Logistics)

- In each 1 km square, five replicate soil samples are collected per X-plot for chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiological status.
- Sampling depth and techniques described (five cores using plastic pipes of specified lengths and diameters).
- Packing and shipping details: envelopes, bags, and pipes are prepared and labeled for post or courier to Merlewood; quick processing prioritized for certain sample types.
- Emphasis on documenting sampling locations precisely and maintaining chain-of-custody through labeled packaging.

## Calluna Sampling

- Collect current year growth (CYG) shoots from Calluna vulgaris for foliar nitrogen analyses.
- Random selection across Calluna populations within squares; standardized collection and drying guidance prior to submission to ITE Merlewood.

## Freshwater Sampling

- Conducted by IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 field teams to ensure synchronized sampling windows.

## Photography (GIS Documentation)

- One camera per team; photographs of every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks.
- Standardized reference features should be obvious, permanent, and visible across seasons.
- Photographs must include square and plot identifiers on a visible board; composition guidelines emphasize plot-dominant framing and minimizing excessive sky.

## Procedures After Survey

- Daily data check: ensure no features are omitted; data may be transcribed to fresh maps only if necessary.
- Timely transport of field assessment books (FABs) and samples back to ITE stations for processing.

## Annexes and GPS Data Collection

- Annex 1: Collecting GPS data
  - Recommended practice for battery, satellite availability, and PDOP quality (target PDOP < 6 for 3D fixes).
  - Distinguishes stationary plotting vs. moving boundary recording; file naming conventions emphasize square and plot identifiers (e.g., 501X4.PSE).
  - Step-by-step guidance for recording, including logging control, data rate settings, and how to annotate new features with appropriate codes.
  - Tips on maintaining data quality in obstructed environments (e.g., elevated aerials, satellite view considerations).
  - Battery charging guidance and almanac updates.

- Attribute reference and sheet
  - Provides a rapid-entry scheme linking numeric attributes to plot IDs and feature types to streamline GPS and field data logging.

## Data Standards, Integration, and Delivery

- Emphasis on standardized field forms (FABs) and consistent coding to enable seamless GIS integration across plots, taxa, and features.
- Data and samples have defined pathways to central laboratories (ITE Merlewood) for processing and storage, ensuring consistency for subsequent GIS analyses.
- Documentation and labeling conventions (square numbers, plot IDs, parcel/feature codes) support traceability and compatibility with thematic and BAP-related GIS outputs.

## Endnotes for GIS Practitioners

- The CS2000 Handbook aims to deliver a spatially explicit, repeatable data collection framework across soils, vegetation, and freshwater domains.
- The integration of GPS data, standardized vegetation coding, and rigorous sampling procedures underpins reliable GIS analyses, trend detection, and policy-relevant mapping across GB landscapes.
