# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Current partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- The Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
- Requests for information handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released (level of precision)
- Release allowed to determine if survey squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for identifying the relevant grid square.
- Six-digit grid references require CEH preprocessing to avoid release; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases, location information may be provided under licence if the requester demonstrates equal or higher confidentiality protection for their IP.
- Spatial data within survey squares could indirectly identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional access terms as six-digit references.
- Four-digit releases have looser IP requirements than six-digit releases.

## Specific licence conditions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences granted for finite periods for defined projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data were securely destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Data must not be used to plan visits or to assess landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same IP confidentiality level as six-digit releases, and users must not attempt to derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences; must be signed by a senior authorized official.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the relevant Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to offer preprocessing support for internal CS partner use within reasonable timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data; CEH involvement may vary by collaboration or payment arrangements.

## Practical implications for monitoring framework authors
- Data governance: balance between public interest and protecting sampling integrity and landowner anonymity.
- Access control: location data are restricted; area-level analyses are possible with licensed data.
- Transparency and metadata: licensing includes documentation and justification; non-release uses rely on formal processes.
- Planning and reporting: annual licensing activity informs policy evaluation and future data-sharing practices.
