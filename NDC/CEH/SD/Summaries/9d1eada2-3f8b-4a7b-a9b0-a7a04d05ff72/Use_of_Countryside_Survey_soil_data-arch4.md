# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Overview
- CS soils were sampled in 1978, 1998 and 2007 to enable detection of significant change over time; 256 squares in 1978/1998, expanded to 591 squares in 2007.
- Power analyses determined the required number of samples to detect meaningful change.
- Data collection involved multiple cores per x-plot with some measurements taken on different cores; not all measurements were performed on all samples.
- A report detailing methods, power analyses, and protocols accompanies the data (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sampling design
- Soils are collected from CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
- x-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses, soil types, etc.
- Some plots are relocated over time due to destruction, access issues, or uncertainty in relocation; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Samples from the same unique identifier originate from the same location but may be 2–3 m apart within a 2 m x 2 m permanently marked plot.

## Sample location
- Sampling locations span various land uses within each square, enabling broader soil property characterization.
- Sampling locations are fixed to 2 m x 2 m plots within each square, targeting consistent spatial coverage across years.

## Sampling
- Depths: top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998/2007 used soil cores inserted and pulled; 1978 used soil pits for the top 15 cm.
- Some soils prevented full core collection due to stones or shallow soils.
- Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken in 2007 for some cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

## Measurements
- 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores carry different measurements (see Table 1).
- Measurements performed on homogenised samples for pH and LOI; bulk density measured in 2007 (not by ISO whole-core method).
- 2007 included a wide set of measurements across cores, including:
  - pH (in water and CaCl2)
  - %C, %N
  - Bulk density
  - Core dimensions
  - Photograph, depth of organic layer
  - Hand texture, soil moisture
  - Olsen P, metals
  - Mineralisable N (subset)
- Table 1 documents which measurements were made for which core plots (e.g., all 591 squares vs. original 256 squares).
- Some data were released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).

## Statistical analysis and data interpretation
- Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes can bias estimates to population stock/change.
- Bootstrapping is not universally applied; consideration of spatial structure is important.
- Recommended approach: use mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within each square.
- For CS, where spatial structure is not the primary interest, a dispersed design with widespread sampling improves regional precision and coverage.
- Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review published CS data analyses and existing CS data releases (listed on the CS website).

## Data governance and accessibility
- Data structure includes unique repeat identifiers (e.g., 2RPT1) to track locations across years, despite minor relocations.
- Not all measurements were conducted for all samples or all years; data availability is explicitly noted (asterisked items indicate data released after 2009).
- Guidance and methodological detail are available in Emmett et al. (2008), with further data and publications listed on the CS website.
