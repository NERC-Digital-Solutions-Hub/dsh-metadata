# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Overview
- Describes the sampling design, location, sampling methods, measurements, and statistical considerations for CS soils in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
- Aim includes informing power analyses to detect significant change and guiding data users on appropriate analyses.
- notes that 2007 covered all 591 CS squares, but not all measurements were made on all samples.
- Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect change (Emmett et al. 2008).
- Data release details: some measurements released only after the Soils Report (November 2009); various measurements appear across different core types and square counts.

## Sampling design
- Soils sampled in three campaigns: 1978, 1998, 2007.
- 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to 591 squares.
- In 2007, not all measurements were taken on all samples.
- Power analyses informed the sampling intensity to detect significant changes over time (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sample location
- Samples collected from CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots per CS square.
- X-plots within a square are not considered replicates due to diverse land uses and soil types.
- Some x-plots relocated across years due to land changes, access, or uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Repeats refer to a location within a square; actual sampling positions within a 2m x 2m plot shift around by ~2–3 m around the corners.

## Sampling
- Soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998 and 2007 used soil cores hammered into the soil; 1978 used a soil pit with sampling from the top 15 cm.
- Some cores could not be fully collected due to stones or shallow soils.
- In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

## Measurements
- 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores had different measurements (Table 1).
- No chemical analyses by soil horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method due to core constraints).
- A full description and implications are documented in Emmett et al. (2008).
- Measurements vary by core type and square; examples include:
  - LOI
  - pH (in water and CaCl2)
  - %C and %N
  - Bulk density
  - Core dimensions and photographs
  - Depth of organic layer
  - Hand texture
  - Soil moisture
  - Olsen P
  - Metals
  - Mineralisable N
  - Other measurements across different core types (e.g., black, long white, short white)
- Data availability notes:
  - Some measurements available for all 591 squares; others limited to original 256 squares.
  - Several data items released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).

## Statistical analysis
- Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring it can bias results toward stock and change of the population.
- When land classes are included, results are weighted toward national estimates of stock and change.
- Bootstrapping is not always used; consideration of CS design is essential.
- Recommended approach: use a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for the clustering of up to five x-plots within each CS square.
- For CS-type designs, where spatial structure is not the primary focus, dispersed observations improve precision and regional coverage.
- Users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review publications that exploit the CS soils data (list available on the CS website).

## Data notes and access
- The dataset spans multiple years and core types, with varying measurement sets per square.
- Data release timing: some measurements released after November 2009; others tied to specific tables (e.g., Table 1 in CS2007 methods).
- Unique repeat identifiers (e.g., 2RPT1) are essential for linking samples to fixed locations, despite occasional relocation.
- References to detailed methodology and data implications are provided (Emmett et al. 2008).
