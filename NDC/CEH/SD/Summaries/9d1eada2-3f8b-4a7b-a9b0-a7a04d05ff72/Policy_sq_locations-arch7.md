# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Sets rules for access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner confidentiality.
- Notes that all other Countryside Survey (CS) data are publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Protects sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Preserves scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Ensures continued ability to reliably inform environmental policy.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to indicate the 10x10 km grid square containing a CS square.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references require CEH pre-processing if possible; very exceptional cases may allow external release under licence.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) carry similar confidentiality concerns and may be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licensing period.
- Upon licence expiry, organisations must confirm data destruction.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same high IP confidentiality as six-digit releases.
- A clause prevents licensees from attempting to identify exact square locations from the provided data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hard-copy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licence decisions follow UK FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations; CEH supports decision processes.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH can provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; others may be considered case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or contractual and is negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for GIS specialists
- Most CS data are public; location data within CS squares are sensitive and regulated.
- If precise location is essential, pursue许可 under exceptional terms via CEH and justify IP/confidentiality needs.
- Plan workflows to use four-digit grid references when possible; request CEH pre-processing to avoid exposing precise locations.
- Engage CEH early to define requirements and ensure compliant use of data.
- Ensure licensing is project-specific, time-bound, and data is securely stored and destroyed after use.
- Maintain awareness of confidentiality constraints when integrating CS location data with other datasets.
