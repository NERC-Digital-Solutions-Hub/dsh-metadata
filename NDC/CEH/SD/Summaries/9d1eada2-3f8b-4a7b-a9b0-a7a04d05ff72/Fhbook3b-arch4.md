# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- A field handbook detailing standardized surveying methods for the CS2000 programme, including sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater), photography, data capture using FABs, and GPS data collection to support long-term ecological monitoring and data interoperability across observers and years.

## Sampling within CS2000
- Three types of sampling are conducted: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling. Freshwater sampling is performed by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff alongside CS2000 field surveyors.
- Background purpose: establish baseline soil quality indices and enable long-term soil health and biodiversity assessments, with samples collected from square locations used in past surveys to support national benchmarks.
- In-square sampling strategy:
  - Five replicate soil samples per 1 km square for soil chemistry, soil fauna, and microbiology analyses; processed at ITE Merlewood.
  - Calluna sampling targets Calluna vulgaris in applicable squares; CYG (current year's growth) shoots are collected in random fashion (30–50 g fresh weight) for nitrogen analyses and related work; samples posted to ITE Merlewood.
- Logistics and procedures:
  - Soil sampling uses three cores per centre plot within each X-plot and standardised collection, labeling, and packing into bags for dispatch via SAE envelopes.
  - Sampling points are located at specified offsets (e.g., 15 cm north of the centre plot corner; other points east and west) to ensure consistent spatial coverage.
  - Despatch procedures require timely posting to ITE Merlewood, with receipts claimed on T & S forms; if issues arise, notes are recorded and sampling may be adjusted.
- Freshwater sampling coordination:
  - Operations may occur concurrently with other CS2000 activities; IFE staff coordinate with CS2000 leads to schedule appropriate times.

## Photography
- Each vegetation plot must be photographed using team-provided cameras and film stock.
- Reference features for photos should be obvious, permanent, and unique to support later localization, and must be visible in the frame.
- Photographs must clearly display the square and plot numbers (written on a reference board placed at the plot edge) and aim to have the plot dominate the frame while including key reference features.

## Procedures after survey
- Post-survey checks are essential: review data sheets to ensure no features were omitted.
- If data integrity is compromised, data may be transposed to fresh maps only as a last resort and only if damage occurred to the original forms.
- Logistics: FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE Stations as soon as possible to maintain data integrity and timeliness.

## Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data
- GPS readiness: ensure battery power, satellite reception (minimum four satellites; aim for low PDOP, ideally < 6 for 3D fixes).
- Recording stationary vs. moving features:
  - Stationary positions: log at plot locations (e.g., vegetation plots) with a stationary fix.
  - Moving features: log along boundaries (for upland areas) by recording the feature from start to end.
- File naming and data management:
  - Each plot/feature requires its own data file; custom file names must encode square number and plot/feature identifier (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4).
  - For new features, file names should reflect the feature type (e.g., 501F1.MOB) and notes should be recorded on the FAB.
- Data collection workflow:
  - Set data sampling rate (default 1 second) and use the attribute reference list to select the correct plot identifier quickly.
  - Start and stop logging via the device interface; monitor elapsed time, and ensure long logging sequences are managed.
- Battery and equipment guidance:
  - Carry spare batteries, know how to recharge, and manage external power connections when necessary.
- Almanac updates and PDOP considerations:
  - If the GPS almanac is out of date, it will auto-update; allow time for this process.
  - Higher PDOP increases location error; strive for minimal PDOP for accurate plotting.
- Practical tips:
  - Minimize obstructions by selecting open sky views; position aerials for optimal reception; use the keypad shortcuts to speed data entry.
  - For stationary plot locations, allow 3–5 minutes of logging in a clear-sky position to ensure robust positioning data.

## Attribute reference and coding (FAB/field data entry)
- The field data capture relies on an attribute reference system to enable rapid entry of plot IDs and feature types.
- The reference scheme provides quick access to common plot identifiers (e.g., X1, D1, Y1, etc.) and a mapping between codes and field features (plots, boundaries, agrarian features, etc.).
- The attribute reference list and sheet are designed to minimize scrolling and to streamline data entry during fieldwork.

## Mosses/lichens and flora taxonomic coding
- The field handbook includes extensive crosswalks for flora and bryophyte/lichen taxa, with standardized abbreviations and codes used in data capture.
- These coding keys support consistent identification and recording of plant species across plots, including forbs/woody species and bryophyte groups.

## Equipment and distribution
- Standard field equipment is distributed to teams to ensure consistent sampling procedures:
  - Core sampling kit: long black pipe; short white pipes; end caps; aluminium plates; trowels; knives; measuring tapes; bags and envelopes.
  - Packaged and labeled materials for sample collection, transfer, and postage to ITE Merlewood, including envelopes and square-specific identifiers.
