# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The document documents the evolution of the sampling framework for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007, grounded in the ITE (Institute of Terrestrial Ecology) Land Classification.
- It explains why stratified, random sampling is used, how the land classification is built and updated, and how samples are allocated to produce national and country-specific habitat estimates.

## Introduction and Core Concepts

- Purpose: To describe how Countryside Survey field samples are chosen and how the ITE Land Classification provides the stratification framework.
- Key idea: Use stratification to ensure samples represent the diversity of land types and to minimize bias that could arise from purely random sampling.
- Stratification rationale: Land types differ in ecological characteristics; stratifying by land class (and, later, country-specific units) improves precision and relevance of national estimates.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification

- Origin: The ITE Land Classification emerged from early 1970s work to classify land areas by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) using a multivariate approach (Indicator Species Analysis, ISA).
- Purpose of classification: Create discrete strata that capture ecological variation across Great Britain to support national ecological surveys.
- Early approach: Start with a 1 km square sampling unit, classify a subset of squares, and assign surrounding squares to classes to form a complete stratification.
- Progression overview:
  - 1978 (CS1978): First large-scale GB ecological survey using 32 ITE Land Classes; sampling targeted eight samples per class, totaling 256 squares.
  - 1984 (CS1984): Expansion to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the original Land Classification approach for estimating habitat areas.
  - 1990 (CS1990): Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares (all 1 km squares); introduction of Land Cover Map; 508 squares surveyed; enabled broader national estimates.
  - 1998/2000 (CS2000): Land Classification updated to enable Scotland-specific reporting; subdivided classes into country-unit versions; increased class count to 40 strata; added sampling to ensure adequate representation; introduced Wales-focused considerations.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting requirements led to further Welsh subdivisions (creating five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); increased Wales sampling to ensure six squares per Welsh class; total strata increased to 45; adjustments to maintain representation across England, Wales, and Scotland; inclusion of an upland module for better upland habitat estimates.

## Sampling Framework by Countryside Survey Year

- CS1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - 32 land classes; sample unit: 1 km squares; eight samples per class (256 total); classification based on environmental attributes.
  - Estimation approach: National habitat areas estimated as the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class times the total area of that class.

- CS1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Sample expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384); framework retained from 1978 with updated sampling.

- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification and Third Field Survey)
  - Revised Land Classification to cover all 1 km squares in GB.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated measurements and data collected from 1984 survey features plus the 1978 quadrats.
  - National estimates anchored to the 1990 Land Classification; introduction of the first Land Cover Map linked to the program.

- CS2000 (Developed Land Classification and Fifth Field Survey)
  - Need to address regional and country-level estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) and upland habitat estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (England with Wales, Scotland); distribution adjusted to ensure adequate representation per country.
  - Result: 40 strata; additional squares added (including 30 upland-related squares) to improve estimates for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - Wales-specific adjustments: Wales received increased Welsh-class subdivisions and more squares to support Wales-only reporting.
  - England saw some reductions in the number of squares in certain classes to maintain overall sampling balance.

- CS2007 (Revised Land Classification for Wales and England/Wales/Scotland)
  - Wales-specific reporting required further Welsh subdivisions (five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and additional Welsh squares; overall strata expanded to 45.
  - Adjustments allowed continued cross-country comparability while enhancing Wales-only estimates.
  - England adjustments: some classes retained with fewer squares; Welsh enhancements prioritized Wales’ reporting precision.
  - Wales remained the most intensively sampled country unit to meet Welsh policy and environmental information needs.
  - Summary tables (for CS2007) detail the numbers of squares by class and country, illustrating the proportional allocation and sampling rates (1:x) across the revised framework.

## Separate Country Estimates and Upland Module

- Country-specific reporting: CS2000 and CS2007 introduce country-unit estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) to align with devolved policy and reporting needs.
- Class subdivisions and aggregations: Land Classes subdivided into country-specific variants; where country representation was low in a class, strata were aggregated with similar classes to maintain meaningful estimates.
- Upland module: An additional module funded to improve habitat estimates in uplands (England and Wales), incorporating extra squares in upland-related Land Classes to enhance statistical precision for upland habitats.

## Note on National Estimates and Data Consistency

- Changing the Land Classification used for national estimates affects cross-survey consistency.
- For cross-survey comparability, the 1990 Land Classification is often used for consistency, while country-specific reporting (CS2007) encourages using the latest classifications for country-level estimates.
- The document provides tabulated comparisons showing how sample sizes per class change across surveys when using the Original (1990) Land Classification, underscoring the impact on national estimates.
