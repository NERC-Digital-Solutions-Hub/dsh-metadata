# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols.

- Sampling design
  - Soils sampled in 1978, 1998 and 2007.
  - 256 squares sampled in 1978 and 1998; 591 CS squares sampled in 2007.
  - Not all measurements were made on all samples.
  - Power analyses used to determine the number of samples required to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots; five x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - X-plots are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types.
  - Some plots relocated over time (destruction, access issues, relocation uncertainty).
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1): square 2, repeat plot 1.
  - Within a square, sampling locations are about 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

- Sampling methods
  - Top 15 cm of soil sampled (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998 and 2007: soil cores hammered in and pulled out.
  - 1978: soil pit dug with sampling from top 15 cm.
  - Some soils prevented full core retrieval due to stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and detailed core-dimension measurements made in 2007 for 2 of the 4 cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1990s: some soil mapping conducted (CS1990).
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores measured (as per Table 1).
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO whole-core method).
  - Full description and implications provided in Emmett et al. (2008).
  - In 2007, a wide range of measurements were recorded on various cores, including LOI, pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and soil invertebrates; data availability varied by plot type and cohort (e.g., 2 of 5 x-plots per original 256 squares, etc.). Some data released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).

- Statistical analysis and data interpretation
  - Analyses should account for study structure (land class effects) to avoid biased national estimates.
  - If land classes are ignored, results reflect stock and change of the population; if included, results become weighted national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses.
  - A mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to account for up to five x-plots within a square.
  - CS is mostly design-based; spatial structure is not the primary interest, and dispersed, widespread sampling improves precision and regional coverage.
  - Analysts are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review existing CS publications for context.

- Data release and guidance
  - Some measurements were released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.
  - See Emmett et al. (2008) for methodological details and data implications.
