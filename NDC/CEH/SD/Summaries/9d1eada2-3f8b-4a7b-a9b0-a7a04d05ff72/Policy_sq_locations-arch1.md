# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential to future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permission.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When locations may be released and precision levels

- Access can show whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence to identify the grid square location.
- Six-digit grid references require attempting to carry out pre-processing by CEH to avoid releasing precise locations; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may external release occur under licence.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (habitats, linear features) could identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
- In exceptional releases, the requesting organisation must demonstrate legal confidentiality/level of protection for their own IP equal to or higher than CS data.

## Specific conditions of release

- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- At licence end, licensees must confirm destruction of location data.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but generally do not require the higher IP confidentiality level; there is a clause preventing attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences, signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under FOI Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide necessary pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe for internal CS partnership use; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid as negotiated.
