# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- The document outlines the evolution of the sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification that underpins the Countryside Survey GB field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
- Purpose: explain how sampling strata were created, how samples were drawn, and how national estimates of habitat features are derived and updated across surveys.
- Emphasis on linking current methodology to historical developments to preserve time-series value and understanding of changes in classification for interpretation of results.

## The ITE Land Classification and Stratification

- Stratification is used to ensure samples are representative and reduce bias across diverse GB landscapes.
- The ITE Land Classification groups 1 km squares into land classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to capture ecological variation.
- Initial implementation (1978) produced 32 land classes; subsequent work expanded and refined the classification to improve country-specific reporting and estimate reliability.
- Across surveys, classification changes influenced how national estimates were calculated, necessitating careful documentation of methodological continuity.

## Chronology of Countryside Survey Sampling

- 1978 - Initial Land Classification and Field Survey:
  - 1 km squares central to a 15 x 15 km grid were classified into 32 land classes; eight samples per class (256 total) were surveyed.
  - Habitat areas were estimated by combining class proportions with mean habitat area per square in each class.

- 1984 - Second Field Survey:
  - Surveyed 12 km squares per land class (total 384); continued using the 1978 classification for national estimates.

- 1990 - All Squares Land Classification (CS1990) and 3rd Field Survey:
  - Land Classification revised to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - A Land Cover Map of GB was linked to this program; national estimates began using the new scheme.

- 1998 - Revised Land Classification (CS1990 updated for 1998 framework) and 4th Field Survey:
  - Land classes increased to 40; classification updated to enable Scotland-only reporting.
  - Separate country estimates introduced, with adjustments to ensure better representation by country and the inclusion of an upland module.

- 2007 - Revised Land Classification (CS2007) and 5th Field Survey:
  - Wales-only reporting requirements prompted further adjustments.
  - Introduction of country-unit subdivisions (five new Wales/England sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an expanded set of 45 strata.
  - Additional Welsh squares (43) added to ensure adequate representation; England adjustments took into account Welsh removals.
  - Upland habitat module expanded with an additional 30 squares to improve England & Wales upland estimates.
  - Tables and maps (Table 3, Figures 6–7) summarize the distribution and sample squares.

## Country Units, Subdivisions, and Sampling Adjustments

- Separate country estimates were introduced to report England & Wales together and Scotland separately, reflecting policy needs.
- Land Classes were subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, etc.) and then aggregated where necessary to maintain balanced representation (creating 40–45 strata in total).
- Welsh-specific adjustments increased sample density for Wales to achieve Wales-only reporting quality, with some English classes retaining smaller samples.

## Upland Module and Data Quality

- An explicit upland module was implemented in CS2000 and expanded in CS2007 to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- The approach relied on targeted sampling in land classes that occur in upland areas to enhance precision of habitat estimates in higher elevations.

## Data Outputs, National Estimates, and Consistency

- National estimates were derived by combining the mean habitat values per square within each land class with the overall land-class area, then adjusting for country/unit classifications.
- The document notes that changing the Land Classification can affect the consistency of national estimates; thus, cross-survey comparability may require careful interpretation or re-computation under a consistent baseline classification.
- Table 4 (noting original vs. updated classifications) provides examples of how square counts per class varied across surveys depending on the classification used.
