# Sampling design

- Overview
  - Soils were sampled in CS in 1978, 1998 and 2007.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 sampled all 591 CS squares, but not all measurements were made on all samples.
  - Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples required to detect significant change (see Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and design
  - Soils are sampled from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 x-plots randomly spaced.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates (they may differ in land use, soil type, etc.).
  - Over time, x-plots may be relocated due to plot destruction, access denial, or relocation uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Samples with the same repeat identifier originate from the same location, though exact sampling positions are about 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

- Data management and lineage
  - Repeats ensure longitudinal linkage across years; cross-year comparability relies on these identifiers.
  - The dataset includes mappings of repeats to squares and years to support longitudinal analyses.
  - Some data were not released until after the Soils Report (Nov 2009), indicating an embargo period for certain measurements.

- Sampling procedures
  - Depths: top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples); cores hammered in and pulled for 1998 and 2007; 1978 used a pit near the surface.
  - Some samples could not yield a full core due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core dimensions were measured for two of the four cores; photographs were taken for black cores; detailed core measurements were recorded.
  - 1978 measurements were limited to pH and LOI; 1998 and 2007 involved multiple cores per x-plot with varied measurements.

- Measurements and data structure
  - Laboratory measurements varied by year and core; not all chemical analyses were performed by soil horizon (samples were homogenised before pH and LOI).
  - Bulk density was measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method).
  - A comprehensive table (Table 1) lists the measurements made on the different soil cores, including:
    - pH (in water and CaCl2)
    - LOI
    - %C, %N
    - Bulk density
    - Core dimensions, depth of organic layer, photographs, texture, soil moisture
    - Olsen P, metals
    - Mineralisable N, among others
  - The number of samples varies by measurement:
    - Some measurements were taken for all 591 squares (e.g., pH, LOI, core dimensions, photographs, soil moisture).
    - Some measurements were limited to the original 256 squares (e.g., %C, %N, Olsen P, metals).
    - A subset of measurements (e.g., a few core measurements) were available for only 2 of the 5 x-plots per original square.
  - In 1998 and 2007, multiple cores per x-plot exist; different cores may have different measurements.

- Data quality, analysis guidance
  - Analyses should consider land class structure to avoid biased population estimates; weighting by land class may be necessary to obtain national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses; a mixed-model approach is recommended, with square treated as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots per CS square.
  - Only one core per location is sometimes used, but CS design favors dispersed observations for regional estimates; spatial structure is not the primary focus.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and interpretation and to review publications exploiting the data available on the CS website.

- Data availability and access notes
  - Some data were released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.
  - The CS 2007 dataset includes data for all 591 squares for certain measurements and original 256 squares for others, with explicit notes in Table 1 about which measurements apply to which sample sets.
