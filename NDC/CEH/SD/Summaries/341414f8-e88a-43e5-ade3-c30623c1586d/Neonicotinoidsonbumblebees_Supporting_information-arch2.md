# The number and individual weight of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris audax) from nests containing neonicotinoids in Wester Ross, UK

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the number and individual weight of Bombus terrestris audax bumblebees from nests exposed to neonicotinoids in Wester Ross, The Highlands, Scotland.
  - Describes experimental design, collection methods, fieldwork, and analytical methods used to generate the dataset.

- Experimental design and field methods
  - Bees were housed in boxes with 3 nests per box; entrances at two ends and a middle entrance.
  - Two Tripols were assigned to each treatment group; approximately 1 meter spacing between Tripols to contain orientation mistakes within a treatment group.
  - Colonies located in a sheltered wilderness/enriched grassland habitat in Wester Ross; region has markedly reduced pesticide load and insecticide use compared with intensively farmed arable areas.
  - No neonicotinoid or organophosphate use was encountered on sampled farms; environmental contamination with these compounds considered unlikely.
  - Treatment exposure via pesticide addition to 1500 ml of supplemental sugar syrup provided to colonies; after spiking, colonies were transported to the field site and opened within a day; bees were free-flying and not forced to consume the syrup. No pollen was provided; bees foraged for themselves.
  - Experimental order at site: UT (untreated) → single treatment → double treatment, to minimize local effects.
  - Two experimental runs:
    - Experiment 1: untreated; chlorpyrifos (150 nM); chlorpyrifos (150 nM) + imidacloprid (10 nM).
    - Experiment 2 (same site): untreated; imidacloprid (10 nM) / chlorpyrifos (150 nM) + imidacloprid (10 nM).
  - Field exposure durations:
    - Experiment 1: 48 days (25 Apr – 11 Jun 2014).
    - Experiment 2: 43 days (27 Jun – 9 Aug 2014; exact dates provided as 28 Jun – 9 Aug 2014 in text).
  - Final day protocol: entrance gates set to permit only bee entries for at least 5 hours (average foraging duration under imidacloprid exposure ~42 minutes); gates then closed and colonies returned to the laboratory for assessment.

- Colony assessment and sampling
  - End-of-exposure assessment metrics:
    - Increase in colony mass
    - Total live number of bees remaining
    - Average bee mass
    - Number of healthy brood cells on the nest surface
    - Overall nest condition
  - Mass measurements:
    - Each colony mass recorded at the start and end of the experiment (excluding sugar syrup feed).
  - Bee processing:
    - Colonies anesthetized with CO2; live bees identified by appearance and movement, removed, weighed, and sacrificed quickly in ice-cold water containing detergent to prevent awakening.

- Treatments and exposure details
  - Pesticides used: chlorpyrifos (150 nM) and imidacloprid (10 nM) in various combinations as described above.
  - Treatment structure designed to compare untreated controls against single and combined pesticide exposures.

- Data collected and structure
  - Dataset consists of two CSV files:
    - Neonicotinoidsonbumblebees_Experiment1.csv
    - Neonicotinoidsonbumblebees_Experiment2.csv
  - Columns: Colony number and treatment
  - Rows: Bee mass (mg), ordered by mass
  - Each CSV corresponds to one experiment (Experiment 1 or Experiment 2)

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Weight recording verification: one person read the bee weight aloud to a second person who entered it into the database.
  - Blinding: recorders did not know which treatment group the nest belonged to.

- Details of data structure
  - Both data files are structured with columns for Colony number and treatment, and rows representing individual bee masses (mg) ordered by mass.
  - Names of the two CSV files are reiterated for clarity.

- Site context and environmental background
  - Location: Wester Ross, The Highlands, Scotland.
  - Environmental context: substantially lower total pesticide load and insecticide use than intensively farmed arable regions (e.g., East Fife); background data referenced from Moffat et al 2015 (in press).
  - No neonicotinoid or organophosphate use detected on farms sampled; environmental contamination with these compounds deemed unlikely.
