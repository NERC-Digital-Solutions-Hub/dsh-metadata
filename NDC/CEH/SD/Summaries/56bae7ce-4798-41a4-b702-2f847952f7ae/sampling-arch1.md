# Sampling Design

- Timeframe and location: May 2014 to October 2014, Mabalane district, Gaza province.
- Village selection: Seven villages chosen along a charcoal production gradient within similar soils, rainfall, and vegetation to represent degraded to intact forest contexts.

## Identification of value chain actors

- Used snowball sampling to identify actors involved in the charcoal supply chain.
- Actors included: village leaders, community foresters, village charcoal producers, association members, village committee members, migrant workers, truck drivers, and district forest officers.

## Sampling strategy by actor type

- Charcoal associations: In each selected village, interview the association president.
- Village charcoal producers: In each village, conduct focus groups with 5–7 producers (including both association members and non-members).
- Charcoal camps: Identify main production areas with a local guide; visit camps randomly and conduct short interviews with workers.
- Community forester: Conduct a personal interview in every village with a forester.
- Truck drivers: Interview drivers opportunistically (e.g., at stops); verify against their license books.
- Additional actors: Contact other relevant actors and arrange interviews as needed.

## Data collection methodologies

- Semi-structured interviews: Conducted at action sites (village center, forest camps, roadsides).
- Focus group discussions: Led by a village leader; sessions typically 1–2 hours.
- Informal communication: Day-to-day interactions recorded by the researcher with translation support.
- Recording: Notes kept in a notebook; electronic transcripts prepared later in the office.
- Triangulation: Validate information by discussing topics with multiple groups/individuals to highlight consistency and differences.

## Interview guidelines and data collection instruments

- Guideline categories include:
  - Charcoal production history
  - Production processes
  - Forest access and distribution
  - Licensing and control mechanisms
  - Association work
  - Marketing and transportation processes
  - Prices

## Topics and data collection forms (Portuguese guidelines)

- Charcoal associations: Collect details on name, founding date, responsibilities, member count, member quotas, licenses, management plans, licensed quantity/area, production to date, site quality, future production plans, decision-making on site, production outside the area, extraction/production control, sales destinations, transportation, workforce size, price per bag, seasonal production, and other governance details.
- Charcoal producers in the village: Information on who can produce, association membership, site control, site quality, production control, committees, production months, number of bags per furnace, sales destinations, transport, price per bag, and whether production occurs outside the designated area.
- Charcoal camps: Data on camp settlement date, expected end date, number of employees, origins, wages, employer, current and upcoming production, typical bag production per furnace, fuel needs, seasonality, work description, and prior employment arrangements.
- Community forester: Name, home community, tenure, role, how the position was obtained, main problems, and salary.
- Truck driver: Driver name, truck owner, license owner, license details and origin, license usage, number of bags per truck, origin of charcoal, destination, price per bag, salary, inspection checkpoints, fines/fees, payment history of fines, and typical incidence of penalties.

## Data quality and practical notes

- Emphasis on translating interviews (Portuguese to local language Changana) to ensure accurate data capture.
- Use of multiple data collection methods and sources to strengthen reliability through triangulation.
- Focused on capturing governance, licensing, market flows, and labor arrangements across the value chain.
