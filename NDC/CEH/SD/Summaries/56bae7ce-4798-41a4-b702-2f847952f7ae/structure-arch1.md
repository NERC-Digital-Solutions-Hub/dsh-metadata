# Details of data structure

- The dataset comprises 12 rtf documents, each containing transcripts from interviews conducted in one of several anonymous villages within the Mabalane forest.
- Villages are anonymized; names are withheld and can be provided by the data owner on request.
- Document set includes a mix of interview formats (semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, informal communications, and short notes) across different stakeholder groups.

- Summary of files and interview contexts

  - villageH.I_trucks: interviews with truck drivers exiting the forest with loaded charcoal; ~10 minutes each; Portuguese; dates 22.07.2014–24.07.2014 and 18.09.2014–20.09.2014.
  - villageH_focus.group: one focus group with members of a charcoal association; one researcher and assistant; Portuguese; date 20.09.2014.
  - villageH_interview.fiscal: informal communication with a district forester; Portuguese; date 22.07.2014.
  - villageI_interview.fiscal: informal communication with a district forester; Portuguese; date 06.07.2014.

- Language and translation
  - Most transcripts involve translation between Portuguese and Changana where needed; several items are in Portuguese.
  - Translation is conducted by native speakers accompanying researchers.

- Data collection setup
  - Interviews led by a single researcher in most cases; some involve two researchers.
  - Use of informal notes alongside semi-structured transcripts in several files.
  - Transcripts and notes are the primary data format (rtf).

- Access, provenance, and metadata
  - Anonymized village identifiers are used; detailed village identities are available from the data owner upon request.
  - The dataset integrates multiple interview formats, participant roles (charcoal workers, foresters, association leaders, truck drivers), and settings across several villages.

- Potential for analysis
  - Enables cross-village comparisons of livelihoods, charcoal supply chains, governance, and stakeholder perspectives.
  - Supports qualitative coding to identify themes, patterns, and potential correlations between stakeholder type, interview type, and responses.
  - Could inform predictive or policy-relevant insights if combined with additional quantitative data (e.g., production volumes, prices, enforcement actions).

- Considerations for analysts
  - Data heterogeneity: mix of focus groups, semi-structured interviews, informal notes, and varying interview formats.
  - Anonymization may limit linkage to exact locales; village identities are restricted to the data owner.
  - Translation and transcription consistency may vary across files; account for potential language nuances and translation bias.
  - Some elements are informal communications or notes, which may require careful interpretation and coding strategies.

- Next steps for working with the dataset
  - Create a metadata catalog capturing file name, participant roles, interview type, language, interviewer(s), translator, duration (if available), and dates.
  - Develop a coding framework to harmonize themes across villages and stakeholder groups.
  - Assess data quality and note any gaps due to informal notes or varying transcription formats.
  - Plan for data access coordination with the data owner to obtain anonymized village identifiers if needed for deeper analysis.
