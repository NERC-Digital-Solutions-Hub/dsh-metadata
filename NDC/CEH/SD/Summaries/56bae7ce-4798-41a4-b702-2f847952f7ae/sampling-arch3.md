# Sampling Design

- Objective and study context
  - Conducted from May 2014 to October 2014 in Mabalane district, Gaza province.
  - Seven villages selected along a charcoal production gradient, ensuring similar soils, rainfall, and vegetation to capture variation from degraded to intact forest areas.

- Identification of value chain actors
  - Used snowball sampling to map actors involved in the charcoal supply chain.
  - Identified actors include: village leaders, community foresters, village charcoal producers, association members, village committee members, migrant workers, truck drivers, and district-level forest officers.

- Sampling strategy (six components)
  1) Charcoal associations: interview the president in all selected villages.
  2) Village charcoal producers: focus group discussions in each village; leader brings 5–7 producers (members and non-members).
  3) Charcoal camps: identify main production areas with a local guide; randomly visit camps; conduct brief interviews with workers.
  4) Community forester: conduct a personal interview in villages with one.
  5) Truck drivers: interview opportunistically (at stops); collect license book at interview.
  6) Other actors of interest: contact and arrange interviews as needed.

- Data collection methodologies
  - Semi-structured interviews: conducted at the action sites (village center, forest, roads).
  - Focus group discussions: typically 1–2 hours, held in village centers.
  - Informal communication: daytime interactions; information recorded by the researcher; translator present (Portuguese to Changana); notes written in a notebook; electronic English transcripts prepared later.
  - Triangulation: information validated by cross-checking with multiple groups/individuals across topics.

- Interview guidelines and topics
  - A comprehensive guideline covers: charcoal production history, processes, forest access and distribution, licensing and control mechanisms, association activities, marketing and transportation, and prices.
  - Detailed, category-specific questionnaires are provided in Portuguese for:
    - Charcoal associations: membership, licenses, management plans, production areas, extraction practices, pricing, supervision, and production season.
    - Charcoal producers in the village: eligibility to produce, site quality, control, entry of operators, seasonal production, sale destinations, transport, pricing, and past production outside licensed areas.
    - Charcoal camps: camp establishment dates, number of workers, wages, production plans, per-forno outputs, fuel requirements, work descriptions, and prior camp experience.
    - Community fiscal officers: identity, origin, role, how they obtained the job, key problems, and salary.
    - Truck drivers: driver and vehicle details, license ownership and usage, cargo quantities, pricing, employment conditions, checkpoints, fines, and payments.

- Data handling and quality considerations
  - Use of translators and field notebooks; subsequent electronic transcription in English.
  - Information triangulated by repeated discussions with diverse respondents to enhance reliability.
  - Fieldwork designed to capture licensing, control, site characteristics, production scales, and market flows, enabling monitoring of governance and data gaps across the value chain.
