## Language, translation and transcription notes
- Translations are between Portuguese and Changana when needed.
- Vocational and leadership roles among participants vary (workers, foresters, association president) across files.
- Some entries include informal notes or communications in addition to structured interviews.

## Access, provenance and governance
- Village names are anonymized; full village identifiers are available only from the data owner on request.
- Data access is controlled: access to the raw transcripts can be requested via the data owner.
- Data collected by multiple researchers, with translations provided by native speakers; dates and collection contexts are documented to support provenance.

## Metadata and quality considerations
- File-level metadata should capture: file name, interview type (interview/focus group/notes), participants, researchers, translators, language, dates, approximate duration (where stated), and any notes on data quality or transcription status.
- The dataset includes a mix of formal semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and informal communications; consistency in metadata is important for discovery and reuse.

## Privacy, ethics and data stewardship implications
- Anonymization of village names protects participant privacy; access controls are required to manage re-identification risk.
- Translation and transcription processes should be documented to support transparency and reproducibility.
- Any sharing or secondary use should consider consent scope and potential sensitivities around charcoal production practices and community dynamics.

## Recommendations for data management and reuse
- Preserve original RTF format for fidelity; consider exporting to more interoperable formats (e.g., UTF-8 text or structured JSON) for analysis while keeping originals archived.
- Implement a concise metadata schema including: identifier, village anonymized name, interview type, participants, roles, language, translator, researchers, dates, duration, and data quality notes.
- Document provenance thoroughly (who collected, who translated, any notes on transcription conventions).
- Maintain access controls and a data-use policy aligned with the data owner’s requirements; provide a clear data access request workflow.
- Plan for ongoing updates or additions by standardizing file naming, versioning, and metadata fields.
