# Sampling Design

- Period and study site
  - May 2014 to October 2014
  - Study site: Mabalane district, Gaza province

- Village selection and production gradient
  - Villages classified along a charcoal production gradient from degraded to intact forest
  - Seven villages selected at different stages of charcoal production
  - Similar soils, rainfall, and vegetation to control environmental variation

- Value chain actors identified
  - Snowball sampling to identify actors
  - Actors include: village leaders, community foresters, village charcoal producers, association members, village committee members, migrant workers, truck drivers, forest officers

- Sampling strategy (six components)
  1) Charcoal associations: interview the association president in each selected village
  2) Village charcoal producers: focus group discussions with groups of 5–7 producers (members and non-members)
  3) Charcoal camps: identify main production areas; random visits; short interviews with workers
  4) Community forester: personal interview in villages with a forester
  5) Truck drivers: interview when opportunities arise; verify license books
  6) Other actors: contact and arrange interviews as needed

- Data collection methodologies
  - Semi-structured interviews: conducted at action sites (village centre with leaders/foresters, forest camps, road sites with drivers)
  - Focus group discussions: led by village leader; typically 1–2 hours
  - Informal communication: daytime interactions; researcher logs notes; translator used (Portuguese to Changana); electronic English transcripts created later

- Data validation
  - Triangulation across topics and groups to validate information and capture multiple perspectives

- Interview guidelines and content (topics covered)
  - Charcoal production history, processes, forest access and distribution, licensing and control, association work, marketing/transportation processes, prices
  - Detailed field guides (in Portuguese) for:
    - Charcoal associations: structure, membership, licensing, management plans, production sites, capacity, production history, transactions, control mechanisms, and seasons
    - Charcoal producers in the village: eligibility to produce, site decisions, control of production, governance (committees), meeting frequency, seasonal production, and output per oven
    - Charcoal camps: camp setup dates, duration, workforce, origins, wages, boss details, annual and near-future production, fuel needs, work descriptions
    - Community forester (fiscal): identity, location, origin, role, how employed, key problems (prohibited cutting, unlicensed production), salary
    - Truck drivers: driver and license ownership, licensing logistics, cargo details (sacks per truck, license-stipulated sacks), sourcing and destinations of charcoal, pricing, payroll, enforcement stops, fines, and bribe-like payments

- Data considerations and outputs
  - Aims to produce data products enabling self-serve analysis (e.g., estimates of production, licensing coverage, and market flows)
  - Outputs may be promoted and iterated based on feedback
  - Potential for promotion of better data creation practices within the charcoal value chain
