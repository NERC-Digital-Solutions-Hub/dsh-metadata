# Sampling Design

- Overview
  - Period: May 2014 to October 2014
  - Study site: Mabalane district, Gaza province
  - Village selection: seven villages along a charcoal production gradient (degraded to intact forest), with similar soils, rainfall, and vegetation

- Objective and scope
  - Identify and map value chain actors involved in charcoal production
  - Understand production processes, licensing and control mechanisms, marketing and transportation
  - Capture association structures, workforce composition (camps, drivers, workers), and pricing
  - Inform understanding of data needs across the charcoal supply chain

- Snowball sampling and actors identified
  - Actors: village leaders, community foresters, village charcoal producers, association members, village committee members, migrant workers, truck drivers, and district-level forest officers
  - Purpose: build a comprehensive network of stakeholders across the value chain

- Sampling strategy (step-by-step)
  1) Charcoal associations: interview the president in each selected village
  2) Village charcoal producers: conduct focus groups (groups of 5–7 producers) with both members and non-members
  3) Charcoal camps: identify main production areas with a local guide; perform short interviews with workers
  4) Community forester: conduct a personal interview in villages with a forester
  5) Truck drivers: interview opportunistically; collect license books when possible
  6) Other actors: contact as needed and arrange interviews

- Data collection methodologies
  - Semi-structured interviews: conducted at action sites (village center with leaders and foresters; forest camps; along roads with drivers)
  - Focus group discussions: village leader facilitates 1–2 hour sessions
  - Informal communications: day-to-day interactions recorded; translator (Portuguese to Changana) present; notes taken; electronic transcripts prepared later
  - Triangulation: cross-verify information by discussing topics with multiple groups and individuals
  - Guiding topics (categories covered): charcoal production history and processes; forest access and distribution; licensing and control mechanisms; association activities; marketing and transportation; prices

- Data management and instruments
  - Documentation: field notebooks, translator-assisted notes; electronic transcripts compiled later
  - Standardized data collection: structured guidelines for each actor type to ensure consistent coverage across villages

- Actor-specific data guidelines (summary of data themes)
  - Charcoal associations: name, foundation date, roles, member count, member quotas, licenses, management plan and specifications, licensed production area and quantity, site details, future production plans, decision processes for site choice, production outside licensed areas, extraction and production operations, sales channels, transportation, number of staff, price per sack, license/site control, and production season
  - Charcoal producers: eligibility to produce, association membership, site control decisions, site quality, production oversight, entry rules for operators, presence of community monitors, production season and volume, number of sacks per furnace, sales channels, transportation, price per sack, and history of production outside licensed areas
  - Charcoal camps: camp establishment date, planned end date, number of workers, worker origins, wages, employer practices, production for current and upcoming months, per-forno outputs, fuel needs, seasonality, work activities (timing for cutting, preparing, burning, bagging, transporting), and worker mobility
  - Community forester: name, community assignment, origin, tenure, role, how the position was obtained, key problems (e.g., prohibited sites, illegal production), salary
  - Truck driver: driver and vehicle details, license ownership and site, licensing process, typical sacks per truck, source of charcoal, destination, wages, checkpoints, penalties, and compliance history

- Data quality, limitations, and governance
  - Data collected through multiple formats (notes, translations, transcripts) with triangulation to improve validity
  - Potential limitations include reliance on snowball sampling, language translation, and variability across sites
  - Emphasis on structured, repeatable data collection to support comparability and subsequent analysis

- End goals and outputs
  - A comprehensive, multi-actor dataset describing the charcoal value chain across the study villages
  - Insights into licensing, control mechanisms, production practices, transport flows, pricing, and seasonality
  - Foundational data to inform policy discussions, management strategies, and coordination within the charcoal sector
