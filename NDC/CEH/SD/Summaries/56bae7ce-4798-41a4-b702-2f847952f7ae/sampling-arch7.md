# Sampling Design

## Context and scope
- Timeframe: Sampling conducted from May 2014 to October 2014.
- Study site: Mabalane district, Gaza province.
- Village selection: Seven villages chosen along a charcoal production gradient (from degraded to intact forest), with similar soils, rainfall, and vegetation to cover different production stages.

## Sampling framework
- Actor identification: Snowball sampling used to identify key actors in the charcoal supply chain, including:
  - Village leaders, community foresters, village charcoal producers, association members, village committees, migrant workers, truck drivers, and district forest officers.
- Sampling strategy (six components):
  1) Charcoal associations: interview presidents in all villages with associations.
  2) Village charcoal producers: conduct focus groups (leader to assemble 5–7 producers, including both association members and non-members).
  3) Charcoal camps: identify main production areas per village, randomly visit camps, conduct short interviews with workers with local guidance.
  4) Community foresters: conduct personal interviews where present.
  5) Truck drivers: interview when possible; request to show license books.
  6) Other actors: contact and arrange meetings as needed.

## Data collection methodologies
- Semi-structured interviews:
  - Conducted at action sites: village center (leaders, association members/presidents, foresters), forests (camp workers), along roads (truck drivers).
- Focus group discussions:
  - Village leader assembles a group; sessions last 1–2 hours.
- Informal communication:
  - Day-to-day conversations recorded by the researcher; translator (Portuguese to Changana) accompanies interviews; notes kept; electronic English transcripts prepared later.
- Triangulation:
  - Cross-check information by discussing topics with multiple groups/individuals to validate and highlight perspectives.
- Interview topic areas (guideline categories):
  - Charcoal production history, production processes, forest access and distribution, licensing and control mechanisms, association activities, marketing and transportation processes, and prices.
- Documentation language:
  - Portuguese guidelines accompany interviews, detailing structured data fields to capture for each actor (see below).

## Instrument content and data fields (Portuguese guidelines)
- Charcoal associations:
  - Name, founding date, roles/responsibilities, member count, member quotas, license details, management plan specifications, licensed quantity and area, number of nuclei, production to date, production site details, site quality, future production plans, site selection decisions, past production outside current area, production/extraction workflow (ovens, equipment, labor), sale destinations, transport, labor force composition, price per sack, license/site controls, production season months.
- Charcoal producers in the village:
  - Who can/knows how to produce, association membership, site decision authority, site quality, production controls, committee presence and operations, seasonal patterns, production methods (ovens, equipment, labor), average sacks per oven, sale destination, transport, price per sack, past production outside current area.
- Charcoal camps:
  - Camp establishment and end dates, number of workers, worker origins, wages, employer payments, duration of production in region, camp owner, current production (this year and upcoming months), sacks per oven, fuel requirements, production season, detailed job tasks and labor composition, prior work history with same or different employer.
- Community fiscal monitor (fiscal comunitário):
  - Name, home community, origin, tenure, role (forest allocation, production oversight, license control), how they obtained the job, main problems encountered, salary.
- Truck driver:
  - Driver name, truck owner, license owner, license quantity and production site, license usage pattern, consistency of license usage, sacks per truck (actual vs. listed), source of charcoal (community, camp, village sacks; quantities per source), destination, salary, typical inspection stops, fines/escorts (who pays and amounts), number of fines paid across trips, frequency of real fines.

## Implications for GIS specialists
- Spatial data to collect and map:
  - Study area and village locations; locations of charcoal camps and production sites; licensed areas and site extents; forest access points; transport routes and hubs.
  - Production intensity indicators (seasonal months, sacks per oven, number of ovens) linked to precise coordinates.
  - Site quality metrics (tree size, distance to community) and license status.
- Data integration and workflow:
  - Consolidate multi-source qualitative data into georeferenced attributes and spatial layers; coordinate data collection with field mapping to ensure consistent coordinates.
  - Translate interview-derived variables into GIS-ready attributes (e.g., association characteristics, camp details, license data, labor force, production volumes).
- Data quality and management:
  - Expect data dispersion across field notes, interviews, and office transcripts; apply triangulation to improve reliability.
  - Plan for coding and transforming semi-structured data into quantitative indicators suitable for mapping and spatial analysis.
- Potential GIS outputs:
  - Maps of charcoal production networks (associations, producers, camps) and their spatial distribution.
  - Licensing footprints and site-specific production zones.
  - Spatial patterns of transport routes, sale destinations, and market access.
  - Temporal dimension: production seasons by location (months of activity).
- Considerations and limitations:
  - Data may be sparse at high resolution; ensure careful geolocation and validation of sites.
  - Language translation and field logistics (e.g., translator presence) can affect data capture and timing.
  - Data from 2014 reflects a historical snapshot; note potential changes over time when comparing with current GIS datasets.
