# Interview guideline

- Purpose: Guidelines with questions prepared in Portuguese for interviews with different actor groups.

- Training and consistency: Aiming to always work with the same assistant/translator; prior briefings about the interview objective and how to pose questions.

- Triangulation and focus: Repeated discussions across varied groups to validate information and highlight perspectives; contextual insights from interviews, conversations, and focus groups help refine subsequent interviews.

- Group composition: Village leader recruits a group as requested; focus groups include men and women; explicit invitation for everyone to contribute.

- Translation: Researcher accompanied by a translator/native speaker; questions translated between Portuguese and Changana as needed.

- Note taking: Lead researcher responsible for taking notes.

- Discussion and clarification: After each interview, information is reviewed with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding; clarifications sought from locals when necessary.

- Transcript in English: Notes are transcribed into English back at the office.

- Back-ups: Multiple backups prepared for all documents.

- Data leadership relevance: The approach supports data quality, provenance, inclusivity, and transparency in qualitative data collection, aiding reliable analysis and eventual dissemination to stakeholders.
