## Data collection methods
- Mix of semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and informal communications.
- Researchers led interviews; translators facilitated language needs.
- Notes accompany some recordings, adding contextual information.

## Language and translation
- Primary translation flow: Portuguese to Changana (and vice versa) via native-speaking translator.
- Some interviews conducted directly in Portuguese.
- Language use varies by village and interview type (formal interviews vs. informal notes).

## Anonymization and access
- Village names are anonymized in the dataset.
- Anonymized data can be re-identified or names obtained from the data owner upon request.

## Data management and quality considerations
- The collection spans multiple sites, interview types, and dates, requiring harmonized metadata for cross-site analysis.
- Translations introduce potential variances; documentation of language handling is essential.
- Preference for clear provenance: interview type, interviewer, translator, date, and location per file.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates a multi-source qualitative data collection with consistent metadata points (interview type, participants, language, date, lead researcher).
- Highlights importance of anonymization, access governance, and translation workflows in cross-site data programs.
- Illustrates challenges around data standardization, coordination across sites, and varied data formats (transcripts, notes, informal communications) within a single dataset.
