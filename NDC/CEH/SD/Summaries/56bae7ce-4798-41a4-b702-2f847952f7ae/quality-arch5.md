# Interview guideline

- The document outlines procedures for conducting interviews with different actor groups, with interview questions prepared in Portuguese.
- A single assistant/translator is preferred; prior to each exercise, the interview objective and how questions should be asked are communicated.
- Triangulation and focusing: topics are revisited with various groups to validate information; context is built from interviews, conversations, and focus groups to better target questions.
- Group composition: village leaders assemble groups as requested; focus groups include both men and women and aim for broad participation.
- Translation: the researcher is accompanied by a bilingual translator; questions can be translated between Portuguese and Changana as needed.
- Note taking: the lead researcher is responsible for capturing notes.
- Discussion: after each interview, information is reviewed with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding; clarifications are sought from locals when needed.
- Transcript in English: notes are transcribed into English after fieldwork.
- Back-up: multiple backups of all documents are maintained.

## Implications for Data Stewards

- Supports data governance by ensuring interviews are well-documented, reproducible, and auditable, with clear language and translation handling.
- Metadata considerations: capture language(s) used, translator identity, interview objectives, and participant group composition.
- Provenance and context: triangulation notes and discussion records enhance understanding of user needs and dataset requirements.
- Representativeness and inclusivity: document how groups were formed and who participated to assess coverage.
- Data security and backups: maintain versioned, secure backups of notes and transcripts to protect data integrity.
