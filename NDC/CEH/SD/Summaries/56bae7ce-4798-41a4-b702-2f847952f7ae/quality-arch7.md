# Interview guideline

## What this guideline covers
- Interviews with different actor groups, with questions prepared in Portuguese.
- Training of a single assistant/translator to maintain consistency.
- Triangulation and focusing: revisiting topics across groups to validate information and gain context.
- Group composition: village leaders recruit groups; focus groups include men and women; all are invited to contribute.
- Translation: a native translator accompanies the researcher; questions are translated between Portuguese and Changana as needed.
- Note taking: the lead researcher records notes.
- Discussion: after each interview, information is discussed with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding; clarifications sought from locals when needed.
- Transcript in English: notes are transcribed into English back at the office.
- Back-up: multiple backups are made of all documents.

## How this supports GIS work
- Ensures accurate, culturally relevant qualitative data to inform map-based analyses.
- Facilitates reliable translation and interpretation of local knowledge into spatial context.
- Provides a clear audit trail (notes, translations, transcripts, backups) for metadata and reproducibility.
