# Details of data structure

- The dataset comprises 12 RTF documents containing transcripts of interviews conducted in multiple villages. All village names are anonymized; names can be requested from the data owner.

- Interview formats represented
  - Charcoal camp workers (village camps): 4 interviews, ~10 minutes each; two researchers + translator (Portuguese-Changana); dates: 08.07.2014 – 25.07.2014.
  - Village A (villageA_all.interviews): 7 semi-structured interviews with villagers involved in charcoal production; informal notes; one researcher; translation Portuguese–Changana; dates: 18.08.2014 – 20.08.2014.
  - Village B (villageB_all.interviews): 1 focus group + 1 semi-structured interview; one researcher; translation; date: 01.09.2014.
  - Village C (villageC_all.interviews): 1 focus group + 4 semi-structured interviews + informal notes; one researcher; translation; dates: 25.08.2014 – 29.08.2014.
  - Village D (villageD_focus.group): 1 focus group; one researcher; translation; date: 18.09.2014.
  - Village E (villageE_focus.group): 1 focus group + 2 semi-structured interviews + 7 short interviews with charcoal-camp workers; one researcher; translation; dates: 11.09.2014 – 17.09.2014.
  - Village F (villageF_focus.group): 1 focus group; one researcher; translation; date: 19.09.2014.
  - Village G (villageG_interview.fiscal): 1 semi-structured interview with the community forester; one researcher; translation; date: 15.09.2014.
  - Village H (villageH.I_trucks): Interviews with truck drivers exiting the forest with loaded charcoal; ~10 minutes each; one researcher + one assistant; language: Portuguese; dates: 22.07.2014 – 24.07.2014 and 18.09.2014 – 20.09.2014.
  - Village H (villageH_focus.group): 1 focus group with charcoal association members; one researcher + assistant; language: Portuguese; date: 20.09.2014.
  - Village H (villageH_interview.fiscal): Informal communication with a district forester; language: Portuguese; date: 22.07.2014.
  - Village I (villageI_interview.fiscal): Informal communication with a district forester; language: Portuguese; date: 06.07.2014.

- Data collection context
  - Transcripts cover actors connected to charcoal production (workers, foresters, association members, truck drivers) across multiple villages in the Mabalane forest area.
  - Interviews conducted in Portuguese, with translation to Changana as needed; some informal communications with foresters.
  - A single researcher often led each set, with translators and sometimes assistants.

- Data quality and structure notes
  - Formats vary by village and type (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, informal notes).
  - Anonymization of village names is maintained; non-identifying metadata available in the dataset but geographic identifiers are not explicit in the transcripts themselves.
  - The dataset is suitable for cross-village qualitative analysis and could be linked to geospatial data if village-level locations and boundaries are provided externally by the data owner.

- Implications for GIS use
  - Potential to map source locations to analyze spatial patterns of charcoal production networks, supply routes, and stakeholder groups.
  - Requires external geospatial identifiers (village coordinates, boundaries, forest areas) to create spatial layers that align with the transcripts.
  - Useful for creating map-based data products that illustrate stakeholder roles, interview coverage by village, and temporal aspects of data collection.

- Privacy, access, and permissions
  - Names are anonymized in the transcripts; village identities can be re-identified only with the data owner’s permission.
  - Consider data sensitivity around charcoal production activities when sharing maps or overlays.
