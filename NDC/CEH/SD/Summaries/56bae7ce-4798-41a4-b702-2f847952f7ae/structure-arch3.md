  - villageC_all.interviews: one focus group, four semi-structured interviews, and notes from informal communication; one researcher; translation as needed; dates 25.08.2014 – 29.08.2014.
  - villageD_focus.group: one focus group with charcoal producers; one researcher; translation as needed; date 18.09.2014.
  - villageE_focus.group: one focus group; two semi-structured interviews (community forester and association president); seven short interviews with workers; one researcher; translation as needed; dates 11.09.2014 – 17.09.2014.
  - villageF_focus.group: one focus group with charcoal producers; one researcher; translation as needed; date 19.09.2014.

- Data collection logistics:
  - Interviews conducted by a single researcher or with one researcher plus an assistant; translations performed as required.
  - Some interviews are notes from informal conversations rather than formal transcripts.

- Data availability and governance:
  - Anonymized village identifiers protect confidentiality; raw village names can be requested from the data owner.
  - Data is stored as individual rtf transcripts, with varied formats across files.
  - The dataset documentation implies potential considerations for data sharing, metadata completeness, and translation fidelity when used for monitoring or policy evaluation.

- Relevance for monitoring framework authors:
  - Provides a multi-stakeholder, qualitative evidence base across different actors in the charcoal production system.
  - Demonstrates practical data collection approaches (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, informal notes) and governance considerations (anonymization, translation, data ownership).
  - Highlights data gaps and challenges relevant to monitoring frameworks, such as access to diverse data sources, metadata quality, and the need to document data provenance and translation steps.
