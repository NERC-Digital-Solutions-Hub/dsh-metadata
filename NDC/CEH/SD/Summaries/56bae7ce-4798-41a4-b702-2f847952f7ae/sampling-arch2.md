# Sampling Design

## Overview
- Period of sampling: May 2014 to October 2014
- Study site: Mabalane district, Gaza province
- Village selection: Seven villages chosen along a charcoal production gradient from degraded to intact forest areas, with similar soils, rainfall, and vegetation

## Identification of value chain actors
- Snowball sampling used to identify relevant actors in the charcoal supply chain
- Actors identified include: village leaders, community foresters, village charcoal producers, association members, village committee members, migrant workers, truck drivers, and district forest officers

## Sampling strategy by actor group
- Charcoal associations: Interview the president in all selected villages
- Village charcoal producers: Focus group discussions with 5–7 producers per village, including both association members and non-members
- Charcoal camps: Identify main production areas with a local guide; randomly visit camps and conduct short interviews with workers
- Community forester: Conduct a personal interview where present
- Truck drivers: Interviewed opportunistically during stops; licenses checked at the end of interviews
- Other actors: Contacted as opportunities arise; arrange interviews as needed

## Data collection methodologies
- Semi-structured interviews:
  - Conducted at action sites (village centre with leaders/association members/foresters; forest with workers; roadsides with drivers)
- Focus group discussions:
  - Led by village leaders in the village centre; typically 1–2 hours
- Informal communication:
  - Ongoing daytime conversations; information recorded by the researcher
  - Researcher accompanied by a translator (Portuguese to Changana)
  - All communications and interviews recorded in a notebook; electronic English transcripts prepared later
- Triangulation:
  - Repeated discussions with different groups/individuals to validate information from multiple perspectives

## Interview guidelines and data capture
- Guideline categories cover: charcoal production history, production processes, forest access and distribution, licensing and control mechanisms, association work, marketing and transportation processes, and prices
- Portuguese-language guidelines include detailed questions for:
  - Charcoal associations (e.g., name, foundation, membership, licensing, management plans, production quantities and sites, control and station season)
  - Charcoal producers in the village (e.g., eligibility to produce, site control, production management, outputs per oven, sale points, transport, pricing, licensing)
  - Charcoal camps (e.g., camp establishment, workforce, wages, production plans, fuel needs, job descriptions)
  - Community forester (e.g., work location, responsibilities, recruitment, problems)
  - Truck drivers (e.g., driver and vehicle details, licensing, shipment quantities, sourcing and destinations, pricing, inspections, fines)

## Data handling and validation
- Translation and language support:
  - Portuguese to Changana translation during fieldwork
  - Notes and interviews recorded by researcher; English transcripts prepared back at the office
- Validation:
  - Triangulation through cross-checking information across interviews, groups, and informal notes

## Data storage and outputs
- Data and datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals for sharing and long-term accessibility
- Outputs include structured interview and focus group data, and standardized forms for associations, producers, camps, foresters, and truck drivers

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides a structured, multi-actor view of the charcoal supply chain, governance, licensing, and production practices
- Enables monitoring of environmental governance, forest access controls, and potential environmental impacts through standardized data collection and reporting formats
- Establishes baseline data for evaluating policy performance and management effectiveness over time through repeatable methods and clear data categories
