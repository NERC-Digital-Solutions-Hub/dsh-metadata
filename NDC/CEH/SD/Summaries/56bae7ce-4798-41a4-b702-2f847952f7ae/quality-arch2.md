# Interview guideline

- Purpose and scope
  - Interview guidelines with questions prepared in Portuguese for interviews with different actor groups.

- Training of assistant/translator
  - Aim to work with the same assistant/translator consistently; brief them before each exercise on the interview objective and how to ask questions.

- Triangulation and focusing
  - Repeated discussions across topics and groups to validate information and capture multiple perspectives; context from interviews, conversations, and focus groups helps focus subsequent interviews.

- Composition of group
  - Village leader typically asks groups to participate; focus groups include both men and women; everyone is explicitly invited to contribute.

- Translation
  - Researcher accompanied by a translator/assistant fluent in the local language; questions translated between Portuguese and Changana as needed.

- Note taking
  - Notes collected by the lead researcher.

- Discussion
  - After each interview, findings discussed with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding; clarifications sought from locals if needed.

- Transcript in English
  - Notes written up in English once back in the office.

- Back-up
  - Multiple backups prepared for all documents.
