# Experimental Design/Sampling Regime

- Purpose: Theoretical analysis (no field/lab experiments) to explore hydrological mitigation by woodland patches through landscape configurations and upslope area calculations.

## Overview

- Two datasets are described: Output_SummaryHiraethlyn and Output_Summary_10_regions.
- Landscape configurations are generated to separate effects of fragmentation from total forest area.
- The LUCI Ecosystem Services model is applied to each virtual landscape to compute upslope area as a proxy for hydrological mitigation.

## Study design and landscape generation

- Output_SummaryHiraethlyn
  - 100 simulated landscapes for the Hiraethlyn sub-catchment.
  - Patch configurations generated by randomly allocating patches up to a user-specified number and area.
  - Landscape parameters: LP (landscape proportion) set to 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%; PN (number of patches) set to 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
  - Objective: separate impacts of fragmentation per se from forest area.

- Output_Summary_10_regions
  - Ten sub-landscapes within the Conwy catchment.
  - Landscape generation repeated for each test area with random LP and PN, creating landscapes along a continuum from 0–100% woodland.
  - More than 700 landscape configurations generated per test landscape (i.e., per sub-landscape).

## Metrics and outputs

- Primary metric: upslope area of woodland patches (area_mitigated_sqkm in Hiraethlyn; mit_per, upslope_area_km2, and related metrics in 10_regions).
- Hiraethlyn variables (examples):
  - avgstreamdst_m: mean overland-flow distance to stream per patch.
  - pland, plandf: landscape proportion ( woodland share) and its factor form.
  - pd: patch density; ed: edge density; enn_cv: variability of nearest-neighbor distance.
  - np: number of patches; area_mitigated_sqkm: area upslope after hydrological routing (dependent variable).
  - total_edge_m: total patch boundary length.
- 10_regions variables (examples):
  - mit_per: mitigated percentage (upslope area as a percentage of study area).
  - prop_mit: mitigated proportion (upslope area as a proportion of study area).
  - upslope_area_km2: upslope area in square kilometers.
  - ed, pd, pland: fragmentation and landscape composition metrics.
  - drainage-related: streamlength_m, draindensitym_m2, draindensitykm_km2.
  - topographic metrics: max_slope, std_slope, mean_slope, std_aspect, meanstreamorder, sumstreamorder.
  - study_area_m2/km2, as well as study_area identifiers.
