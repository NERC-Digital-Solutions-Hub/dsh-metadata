# Overview

- Study aim and scope
  - Surveyed exotic plant species along 100 m transects across four habitats (Oil palm, Forest-oil palm edge, Disturbed forest, Intact forest) within conservation set-asides in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.
  - Conducted over two field seasons (2017 and 2019) across 21 sites in six oil palm plantations, with forest remnants embedded inside plantations.
  - Measured canopy cover and the number of large native trees for each transect to characterize forest structure.

- Data assets and files
  - exotic_species_presence_absence.csv: Presence/absence (0/1) of 18 exotic plant species recorded in every 1 m section along each transect (n=78 transects across 21 sites).
  - transect_habitat_data.csv: Habitat- and environment-related measurements for each 100 m transect, including location, canopy metrics, and large native tree counts.

- Study design and site context
  - Forest remnants are remnants within RSPO-certified oil palm plantations, often previously logged and sometimes too steep/rocky for cultivation.
  - Transect locations spanned edges and interiors to capture invasion from oil palm into adjacent forests.
  - Spatial design included at least 1 km separation between sites to reduce spatial autocorrelation.

- Methods and data collection
  - Four habitats sampled per site, with transects oriented to capture variation in light and disturbance.
  - Exotic species recorded at 1 m intervals along 100 m transects (2 m on either side), yielding a range metric of 0–100 per species per transect.
  - Exotics identified using pilot surveys, literature, and local botanists; morphospecies and certain taxa excluded for identification difficulty.
  - Canopy cover measured with a concave densiometer at 5 points per transect, facing all cardinal directions; number of large native trees (>20 cm DBH) counted along the transect.

- Data structure and key variables
  - exotic_species_presence_absence.csv
    - Columns include: Site code, Habitat, Metre number (1–100), and 18 species columns (presence 1 / absence 0) for each metre segment.
  - transect_habitat_data.csv
    - Columns include: Plantation, Site code, Habitat, Date, start/end latitude/longitude, Canopy cover (derived from densiometer), Overall average densiometer, Total number of large native trees, 20/40/60/80/100 m densiometer readings in four directions, and the number of large native trees at 10–100 m at 10 m intervals.

- Quality control and data provenance
  - Followed established field protocols; single observer for consistent measurements per variable.
  - Data cross-checked for errors; pilot surveys used to validate species lists.
  - One transect (Site F25, Disturbed forest) lacked the 100 m canopy value; canopy for that transect calculated from four measurements instead of five.

- References and data context
  - Data associated with Waddell et al. (2020) Vegetation and habitat data for fragmented and continuous forest sites in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, 2017 (NERC EIDC). Site codes correspond to the related data holdings; citations provided for species lists and methodological references.

- Relevance for data leadership and decision-making
  - Enables assessment of exotic plant invasion patterns along a disturbance gradient and edge effects within agro-forest landscapes.
  - Supports monitoring of habitat openness and canopy structure as potential drivers of invasion.
  - Provides a structured, citable dataset with clear metadata and provenance suitable for cross-site comparisons, policy-relevant reporting, and integration with conservation and RSPO-HCV frameworks.
