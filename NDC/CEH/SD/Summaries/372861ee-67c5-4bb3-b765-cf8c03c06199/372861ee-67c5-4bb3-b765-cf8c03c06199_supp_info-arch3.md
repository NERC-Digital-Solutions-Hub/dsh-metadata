Vegetation and habitat data for fragmented and continuous forest sites in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, 2017

- Purpose and scope
  - Document exotic plant communities and forest structure across four habitats representing a disturbance gradient within RSPO-certified oil palm plantations in Sabah.
  - Two field seasons (July–Oct 2017 and Feb–Apr 2019) across six plantations containing forest remnants embedded in oil palm.
  - Focus on forest remnants managed as High Conservation Value areas; survey conducted at 21 sites, with transects in oil palm, forest-oil palm edge, disturbed forest, and intact forest.

- Key indicators and measures for monitoring
  - Exotic plant presence-absence for 18 species recorded along 78 transects (100 m each), at 1 m interval within 2 m on each side (0–100 m). Outcome: occurrence range per species per transect (0–100).
  - Canopy openness and structure: canopy cover estimated with densiometer readings; mean canopy cover per transect; number of large native trees (>20 cm DBH) along transect.
  - Habitat gradient: four habitat types from most disturbed (Oil palm) to least disturbed (Intact forest).

- Data files and contents
  - exotic_species_presence_absence.csv
    - Rows: 78 transects; Columns: Site code, Habitat, Metre number (1–100), presence (1) / absence (0) for 18 exotic species (examples include Asystasia gangetica, Chromolaena odorata, Mikania micrantha, Lantana camara, etc.).
  - transect_habitat_data.csv
    - Rows: 78 transects; Columns include Plantation, Site code, Habitat, Date, start/end coordinates, canopy cover, densiometer readings (N, E, S, W at 20/40/60/80/100 m), and counts of large native trees at 10–100 m in 10 m intervals.

- Methodology and design
  - Study design: transects located in six large-scale plantations with native forest remnants; 21 sites in total; minimum 1 km between sites to reduce spatial autocorrelation.
  - Habitat sampling: up to four habitats per site to capture variation in exotic species spread from oil palm into adjacent forest.
  - Field procedures: presence-absence recorded for each exotic species in every 1 m segment; canopy cover measured at five points per transect facing cardinal directions; large native trees counted along transect five metres either side.
  - Species verification: pilot transects used literature and local botanists to confirm exotic status; excluded leguminous cover crop and morphospecies not identifiable to species; 18 exotic species retained as representative.

- Data quality and governance
  - Protocols aligned with established methodologies; a single observer collected key measurements to ensure consistency.
  - Data checked for errors; notes indicate a missing 100 m densiometer value for one transect (F25, Disturbed forest) with canopy cover adjusted from four measurements.
  - Metadata and dataset provenance documented; data are publicly shared with clear quality control notes and references.

- Context and relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides concrete, policy-relevant indicators: exotic species occurrence, canopy structure, and native tree density across a disturbance gradient within plantation landscapes.
  - Supports monitoring of invasion risk and forest integrity in oil palm-dominated regions; enables assessment of edge effects and biodiversity conservation value of forest remnants.
  - Demonstrates a replicable data-collection framework suitable for ongoing monitoring, with explicit data structure (two CSV files) and metadata to facilitate integration into monitoring dashboards or policy evaluations.
  - Highlights data governance considerations relevant to monitoring frameworks, including data accessibility, metadata completeness, and the need for standardized, openly shared datasets.

- Limitations and considerations for interpretation
  - One transect lacked a complete 100 m densiometer measurement; average canopy figures adjusted accordingly.
  - Some remnants were highly disturbed or steep; access limitations may affect representativeness of the “intact forest” category in very small remnants.
  - Excluded certain morphospecies and a leguminous cover crop; results pertain to the 18 selected exotics and may not capture all potential invasives.
  - Temporal scope limited to two field seasons; while suitable for cross-sectional assessment and gradient interpretation, longer-term trends require continued repeat surveys.
