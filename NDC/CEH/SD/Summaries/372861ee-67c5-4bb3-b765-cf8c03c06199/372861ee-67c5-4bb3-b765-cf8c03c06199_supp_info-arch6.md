# Overview

- Study purpose and scope
  - Surveyed exotic plant species along 100 m transects across four habitats (oil palm road, forest-oil palm edge, disturbed forest, intact forest) within RSPO-certified oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.
  - Conducted across 21 sites within six large-scale plantations, using forest remnants embedded in oil palm landscapes.
  - Field seasons: July–October 2017 and February–April 2019.
  - Sites are at least 1 km apart to avoid spatial autocorrelation; most forest remnants surrounded by oil palm, with some connected to larger forest reserves.
  - Aims include characterizing exotic species spread from oil palm into adjacent forest remnants and linking occurrences to habitat stage and canopy structure.

- Data files and structure
  - exotic_species_presence_absence.csv
    - Records presence (1) or absence (0) of 18 exotic plant species at 1 m intervals along each transect (78 transects total).
    - Columns include: Site code, Habitat, Metre number (1–100), plus 18 species columns (e.g., Asystasia gangetica, Chromolaena odorata, Mikania micrantha, Lantana camara, etc.).
  - transect_habitat_data.csv
    - Per-transect, 100 m records (n = 78) with habitat and environmental context.
    - Columns include: Plantation, Site code, Habitat, Date, start/end coordinates (lat/long), canopy cover (derived from densiometer readings), Overall average densiometer, Total number of large native trees (>20 cm DBH), 20 m–100 m densiometer readings by cardinal direction (N, E, S, W) and distance, and numbers of large native trees at 10 m–100 m intervals.

- Habitat and transect design
  - Four habitats representing a disturbance gradient:
    - Oil palm (most disturbed)
    - Forest-oil palm edge
    - Disturbed forest
    - Intact forest (least disturbed)
  - Transects are 100 m long and 2 m wide (surveyed in 1 m segments with 2 m on either side), capturing presence/absence for each 1 m segment.
  - Transects located along plantation roadsides (oil palm), edges where oil palm meets forest, skid trails/old roads/terraces (disturbed forest), and closed-canopy forest (intact forest).

- Measurements and variables
  - Exotic species data (exotic_species_presence_absence.csv)
    - 18 exotic plant species tracked as binary presence/absence per 1 m segment; per-transect occurrence ranges 0–100.
  - Habitat data (transect_habitat_data.csv)
    - Canopy structure and light
      - Canopy cover (percentage; derived from densiometer)
      - Overall average densiometer
      - 20 m, 40 m, 60 m, 80 m, 100 m densiometer readings for N, W, S, E
    - Forest structure
      - Total number of large native trees (>20 cm DBH) along transect (summary across 5 m widths)
      - Number of large native trees recorded at 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, ..., 100 m positions
    - Spatial context
      - Plantation name, site code, habitat, and survey date
      - Start and end coordinates of each transect (0 m to 100 m)

- Data collection and quality control
  - Methodology aligns with established protocols; data coded as presence/absence (0/1) for each species.
  - A single observer collected and checked measurements for each variable to ensure consistency.
  - Data cross-checked for errors; one transect (Site F25, Disturbed forest) had a missing 100 m canopy value, with canopy computed from remaining measurements.

- Notable methodological details
  - Species identification based on literature and field verification with local botanists; 18 species selected as representative of exotic plant communities in Sabah.
  - Exclusions: leguminous cover crops and certain morphospecies were not included; graminoids excluded due to identification challenges.
  - Edge effects and disturbance histories acknowledged; many remnants are small and likely exhibit extensive edge influence.

- Potential data uses and interpretation
  - Analyze how exotic plant occurrence varies across the disturbance gradient and distance from forest edges.
  - Link exotic occurrence to canopy openness and structural complexity (canopy cover, large native tree counts, densiometer readings).
  - Inform management decisions for RSPO-certified plantations by assessing invasion risk and guiding restoration or monitoring programs.

- Limitations and considerations
  - One canopy measurement missing; certain transects may have limited data for some canopy positions.
  - Data represent a snapshot across two field seasons; temporal dynamics beyond 2017 and 2019 are not included.
  - Spatial autocorrelation minimized by site spacing, but fine-scale spatial patterns may still exist within transects.

- References and data provenance
  - Data collection and context align with prior work and referenced literature on invasive species, forest structure, and plantation management.
  - Related datasets and methodological references provided to support interpretation and integration with other studies (e.g., RSPO standards and Sabah forest research).

- Useful notes for data users
  - Ensure careful handling of site codes (F2–F27 with some exclusions) when merging datasets.
  - When computing habitat-level summaries, consider both 100 m transect scale and per-1 m segment data for fine-scale patterns.
  - The dataset supports crosswalks with forest structure metrics and could be integrated with other vegetation or invasion datasets for broader analyses.
