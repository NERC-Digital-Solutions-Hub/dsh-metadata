# Vegetation and habitat data for fragmented and continuous forest sites in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, 2017

## Overview and purpose
- Describes exotic plant communities along 100 m transects across four habitats (oil palm, forest-oil palm edge, disturbed forest, intact forest) at 21 sites within six RSPO-certified oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.
- Two field seasons: July–Oct 2017 and Feb–Apr 2019.
- Data aim to quantify occurrence of exotic species across a disturbance gradient and relate it to canopy structure and large native-tree presence.
- Two CSV data files accompany the study, enabling analysis of species presence-absence and habitat/structural measurements.

## Data files and contents
- exotic_species_presence_absence.csv
  - 78 rows (one row per 1 m section of each 100 m transect).
  - Columns include: Site code, Habitat, Metre number (1–100), and presence (1) / absence (0) for 18 exotic plant species (e.g., Asystasia gangetica, Chromolaena odorata, Mikania micrantha, Lantana camara, etc.).
- transect_habitat_data.csv
  - 78 rows (one per 100 m transect).
  - Columns include: Plantation, Site code, Habitat, Date, start/end transect coordinates, canopy cover, Overall average densiometer, total number of large native trees, and densiometer readings and large-native-tree counts at specified distances (10–100 m) and directions (N, E, S, W).

## Study design and sampling
- Study sites: 21 sites across six large oil palm plantations with native forest remnants; sites chosen to be at least 1 km apart to reduce spatial autocorrelation.
- Habitats: Four levels of disturbance from most disturbed (Oil palm) to least disturbed (Intact forest).
- Transects: 100 m long, surveyed in up to four habitats per site; transects are 2 m wide; presence/absence recorded for each 1 m section along the transect (i.e., 2 m2 per metre section).
- Canopy and structure: Canopy cover and the number of large native trees (>20 cm DBH) recorded along transects.
- Species identification: Based on pilot surveys and expert consultation; excluded legumes planted as cover crops, some morphospecies, and exotic graminoids due to identification challenges.

## Data fields and units (key points)
- exotic_species_presence_absence.csv
  - Rows: 1 m sections across 78 transects.
  - Columns: Site code; Habitat; Metre number; presence/absence (1/0) for 18 exotic species.
- transect_habitat_data.csv
  - Rows: 78 transects.
  - Columns: Plantation; Site code; Habitat; Date; start/end coordinates; Canopy cover (percentage); Overall average densiometer; Number of large native trees; 20 m, 40 m, 60 m, 80 m, 100 m densiometer readings by cardinal directions; Number of large native trees at 10–100 m along the transect (in 10 m increments).

## Calculation and methodological notes
- Canopy cover calculation: Canopy cover = 100 − (Overall average densiometer × 1.04). The 1.04 factor converts densiometer readings to the percentage of overhead area not occupied by canopy; subtracting from 100 yields canopy coverage.
- Canopy measurements: Overall average densiometer is derived from 20 readings taken at 20 m intervals, facing four cardinal directions at each point.
- Habitat and transect placement: Transects were placed to capture edges and interior conditions across four habitat types, with distances from edges ranging 53–90 m depending on habitat.

## Quality control, provenance, and governance
- Data collection followed established protocols; the same observer conducted estimated canopy (densiometer) values to ensure consistency.
- Data were checked for errors and validated against field protocols.
- Metadata and data relationships reference related data holdings (site codes link to Waddell et al., 2020) and are associated with the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (data DOI provided in references).
- Notable data issue: In one transect (Site F25, Disturbed forest), the 100 m densiometer measurement was missed; canopy for that transect was calculated from the four available measurements.

## Access, interoperability, and reuse considerations for Data Stewards
- Data are provided as two CSV files with clear row-level mapping between transects and 1 m sections.
- Data dictionaries and column headers are explicit, enabling programmatic ingestion and integration with related datasets (e.g., Waddell et al., 2020 vegetation and habitat data).
- Cross-referencing: Site codes (F2–F27, excluding F4, F17, F18) map to related data holdings; dataset is part of a broader Sabah forest biodiversity data framework.
- Limitations to note for stewardship: species identifications rely on field-sourced checks; exclusion of certain taxa (leguminous cover crop, certain morphospecies, and some graminoids) may affect comparability with other datasets; one missing canopy measurement requires handling in downstream analyses.
