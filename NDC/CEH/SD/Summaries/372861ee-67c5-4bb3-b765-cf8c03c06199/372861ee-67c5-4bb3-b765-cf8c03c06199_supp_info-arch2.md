# Vegetation and habitat data for fragmented and continuous forest sites in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, 2017

## Aim
- Provide standardized data to assess environmental health and policy-relevant ecological changes by documenting exotic plant invasions and habitat structure across disturbed and intact forest remnants within RSPO-certified oil palm landscapes.

## Scope and design
- Location: Sabah, Malaysian Borneo; six oil palm plantations with forest remnants embedded within plantations.
- Sites: 21 sites across six plantations, located at least 1 km apart to reduce spatial autocorrelation.
- Timeframe: Field seasons in 2017 (Jul–Oct) and 2019 (Feb–Apr).
- Landscape context: Forest remnants often left unplanted due to topography or previous logging; remnants managed as High Conservation Value areas.

## Habitats surveyed
- Four habitat types along a disturbance gradient:
  - Oil palm (along plantation roads)
  - Forest-oil palm edge (areas where oil palm meets forest)
  - Disturbed forest (degraded forest close to edges)
  - Intact forest (closed-canopy forest away from edges)

## Data collected and structure

### Exotic plant presence/absence data
- File: exotic_species_presence_absence.csv
- Coverage: 78 transects across 21 sites, recording presence/absence for 18 exotic plant species.
- Spatial resolution: 1 m sections along each 100 m transect (2 m wide assessment area; presence = 1, absence = 0).
- Output measure: per-species occurrence range along each transect (0–100 per transect).

### Habitat structure and canopy data
- File: transect_habitat_data.csv
- Transects: 78 in total (across the four habitats).
- Metrics per transect:
  - Canopy cover (derived from densiometer readings)
  - Overall average densiometer
  - Number of large native trees (>20 cm DBH) along the transect
  - Densiometer readings at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 m in four directions (N, W, S, E)
  - Start and end coordinates of the transect (latitude/longitude)
  - Distance-specific counts of large native trees at 10–100 m (5 m intervals) to capture vertical structure and edge effects
- Metadata:
  - Plantation name
  - Site code (F2–F27, excluding F4, F17, F18)
  - Date of survey
  - Habitat category (Oil palm, Forest-oil palm edge, Disturbed forest, Intact forest)

## Measurements and definitions
- Exotic species data: presence/absence for each of 18 species in every 1 m segment along each transect (0–1 per segment; 100 segments per transect).
- Canopy and structure data: canopy cover percentage and counts of large native trees along the transect; canopy estimates derived from densiometer readings and standardized calculations.
- Spatial layout: transects run 100 m in length; four habitats capture a gradient from highly disturbed to relatively undisturbed forest.

## Quality control
- Adherence to established field protocols; where applicable, methodologies cited.
- A single observer conducted all specific densiometer-based measurements to ensure consistency.
- Data were carefully checked for errors; one minor exception: a 100 m canopy reading was missing for transect F25 in Disturbed forest, with canopy calculated from the remaining measurements.

## Data interpretation and use
- Suitable for monitoring environmental health by:
  - Comparing exotic plant occurrence across disturbance gradients and habitat types
  - Linking exotic presence to canopy openness and native tree density
  - Assessing edge effects and potential spillover of invasives from oil palm into forest remnants
  - Providing baseline metrics for policy evaluation in RSPO-certified landscapes
- Enables data integration with other environmental datasets to increase usefulness beyond single-use analyses.

## References and provenance
- Methodology and species lists informed by established literature and local botanists.
- Related data and study context referenced in accompanying materials (Waddell et al., 2020; Bakar 2004; CABI 2017; and others).

## Notes for analysts
- Site codes and plantation metadata allow alignment with other Sabah datasets (e.g., habitat, vegetation, and fragmentation studies).
- The two CSV files together provide a rich, standardized dataset for temporal and spatial comparisons of exotic invasion patterns and forest structure within commercial landscapes.
