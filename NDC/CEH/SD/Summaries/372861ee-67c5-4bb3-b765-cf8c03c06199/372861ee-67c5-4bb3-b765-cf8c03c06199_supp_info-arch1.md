# Overview

- Survey of exotic plant species along 100 m transects across four habitats in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo: oil palm road (oil palm), forest-oil palm edge, disturbed forest, and intact forest within RSPO-certified oil palm plantations.
- 21 sites across six plantations; forest remnants embedded in oil palm landscapes, many surrounded by oil palm; sites at least 1 km apart to avoid spatial autocorrelation.
- Measured canopy cover and the number of large native trees for each transect to assess forest structure and openness.

Data files and contents

- exotic_species_presence_absence.csv
  - Presence (1) or absence (0) of 18 exotic plant species recorded in each 1 m section along 78 transects.
  - Columns include: Site code, Habitat, Metre number (1–100), and 18 species names (e.g., Asystasia gangetica, Ageratum conyzoides, Chromolaena odorata, Mikania micrantha, etc.).
- transect_habitat_data.csv
  - Habitat- and habitat-averaged measurements for each 100 m transect (n=78).
  - Columns include: Plantation, Site code, Habitat, Date; transect start/end coordinates; canopy cover; overall average densiometer; total number of large native trees; 20 m, 40 m, 60 m, 80 m, and 100 m densiometer readings by cardinal direction; and counts of large native trees at 10–100 m intervals.

Study sites and habitats

- Study period: two field seasons (July–October 2017 and February–April 2019).
- Locations: six large-scale oil palm plantations in Sabah with forest remnants; 21 study sites within these plantations.
- Habitats along a disturbance gradient:
  - Oil palm (most disturbed)
  - Forest-oil palm edge
  - Disturbed forest
  - Intact forest (least disturbed)
- Transects per habitat: oil palm (n=21), forest-oil palm edge (n=21), disturbed forest (n=20), intact forest (n=16).
- Transects located along roadsides, edges, skid trails, terraces, or inside intact forest; distances to edges varied (e.g., intact forest on average 90 m from edge).

Transect surveys and species data collection

- 100 m long transects; exotic species presence/absence recorded every 1 m within a 2 m belt (i.e., 2 m on each side).
- Pilot work used to identify exotic species; final list included 18 exotics representative of Sabah's invasive flora.
- Species identification verified with local botanists; excluded leguminous cover crops, certain exotic grasses, and unresolved morphospecies.
- Data collected across two field seasons and across multiple sites to capture spatial variation.

Habitat measurements and forest structure

- Canopy cover: measured every 20 m with a concave densiometer; five points per transect; mean of readings facing four cardinal directions per point.
- Large native trees: counted >20 cm DBH along transect, five metres either side.
- Oil palm trees excluded from native-tree counts.

Data structure and units

- exotic_species_presence_absence.csv
  - Rows: 78 transect metre sections.
  - Columns: Site code, Habitat, Metre number (1–100), and 18 species presence/absence values (0 or 1).
- transect_habitat_data.csv
  - Rows: 78 transects.
  - Columns: Plantation, Site code, Habitat, Date, start/end coordinates, canopy cover (percent), Overall average densiometer, total large native trees, 20 m/40 m/60 m/80 m/100 m densiometer readings by direction, and 10 m–100 m counts of large native trees.
- Notes on data values:
  - Canopy cover derived from densiometer readings (percentage of canopy present).
  - Densiometer readings reported for each direction at multiple distances.
  - Large native trees counted at multiple offsets along transects.

Quality control and notes

- Methodology followed established protocols; same observer for each variable during data collection.
- Data checked for errors; one transect (Site F25, Disturbed forest) had a missing 100 m canopy value; canopy calculated from four measurements instead of five for that transect.
