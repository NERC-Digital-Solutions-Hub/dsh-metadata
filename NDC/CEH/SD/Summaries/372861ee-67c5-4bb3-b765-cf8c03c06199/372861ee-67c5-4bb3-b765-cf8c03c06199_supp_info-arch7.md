# Vegetation and habitat data for fragmented and continuous forest sites in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, 2017

## Overview
- Dataset derived from surveys of exotic plant species along 100 m transects across four habitats (oil palm road, forest-oil palm edge, disturbed forest, intact forest) at 21 sites within six oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.
- Measurements include presence/absence of 18 exotic plant species, canopy cover, and number of large native trees.
- Field work conducted over two seasons: July–October 2017 and February–April 2019.
- Data available in two CSV files: exotic_species_presence_absence.csv and transect_habitat_data.csv.

## Data files and contents
- exotic_species_presence_absence.csv
  - Rows: one metre section of a 100 m transect (n = 78 transects).
  - Columns: Site code, Habitat, Metre number (1–100), and 18 species presence (1) or absence (0) indicators for Asystasia gangetica, Ageratum conyzoides, Chromolaena odorata, Mikania micrantha, Cleome rutidosperma, Mimosa pudica, Mimosa diplotricha, Hyptis capitata, Clidemia hirta, Ludwigia hyssopifolia, Euphorbia heterophylla, Ipomoea triloba, Synedrella nodiflora, Emilia sonchifolia, Euphorbia hirta, Passiflora foetida, Lantana camara, Crassocephalum crepidioides.
- transect_habitat_data.csv
  - Rows: one transect per row (n = 78).
  - Columns: Plantation, Site code, Habitat, Date, Transect start/end coordinates (lat/long), canopy cover, Overall average densiometer, total number of large native trees (>20 cm DBH), and 20 m interval densiometer readings (N, W, S, E) at 5 positions (10 m, 20 m, …, 100 m) plus numbers of large native trees counted at 10–100 m in 10 m increments.

## Study sites and habitats
- 21 transects across six Wilmar oil palm plantations with forest remnants.
- Habitats represent a disturbance gradient: Oil palm (most disturbed) → Forest-oil palm edge → Disturbed forest → Intact forest (least disturbed).
- Proximity to edges and disturbance histories noted; some sites inaccessible inside forest due to steep terrain.

## Transect survey methodology
- 100 m long, 2 m wide transects.
- Exotic species presence/absence recorded for each 1 m segment and for 1 m on both sides (2 m² area per segment), yielding a 0–100 occurrence range per species per transect.
- Habitat-specific sampling to capture edge effects and gradient from plantation to forest interior.
- Field seasons: 2017 and 2019; species list refined via pilot transects and expert verification; certain species excluded (e.g., leguminous cover crop, hard-to-identify morphospecies).

## Habitat measurements and data details
- Canopy cover: estimated with a concave spherical densiometer at five points per transect, each point facing four cardinal directions; canopy cover derived from these readings.
- Large native trees: counted along transects at 5 m intervals on either side; only trees >20 cm DBH considered.
- Canopy and tree data provide metrics of forest openness and structural complexity to relate to exotic species distributions.

## Data structure and interpretation notes
- exotic_species_presence_absence.csv: 78 transects × 18 species × 1 m segments; values are 0 (absent) or 1 (present) per metre segment.
- transect_habitat_data.csv: 78 transects with spatial coordinates, habitat type, date, canopy metrics, densiometer readings, and tree counts at multiple distances from the transect.
- Canopy calculations: canopy cover percentage = 100 – (overhead area not occupied by canopy), derived from densiometer-based measurements.
- Data quality: standardized protocols; single observer for each measured variable to ensure consistency; manual checks for errors; a note on one transect where 100 m canopy data were missing and were averaged from four measurements.

## Usage and GIS integration notes
- Spatial analysis: treat each transect as a 100 m line feature with start/end coordinates; assign habitat category to each transect for gradient analysis.
- Attribute joins: link exotic species presence data to transects via Site code and Habitat; aggregate 1 m segment data to 100 m transect-level metrics (e.g., species richness, occurrence per species).
- Vegetation context: use canopy cover and large native tree counts to explore relationships between forest structure and exotic plant distributions.
- Potential analyses: map exotic species distributions by habitat, assess edge effects, model relationships between canopy metrics and exotic plant occurrence.
- Data caveats: one transect with missing 100 m canopy value; ensure handling of missing canopy values in analyses.
