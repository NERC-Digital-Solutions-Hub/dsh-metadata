# AFEX Experiment

## Site description
- Located at the AFEX project area within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (02°25' S, 59°43' W).
- Climate: mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% (rainy season peaks in April).

## Experimental setup – AFEX Experiment
- Full factorial nutrient addition design with eight treatments plus an untreated control.
- Treatments: control; N; P; cations (Ca, Mg, K); N+P; N+cations; N+P+cations.
- Design: four independent blocks, each with eight plots (32 plots total); plots are 50 m × 50 m, with measurements focused on a central 30 m × 30 m area; minimum 250 m between blocks.
- Nutrient application rates (per year): 125 kg N ha⁻¹ (as urea); 50 kg P ha⁻¹ (as triple superphosphate); 50 kg Ca ha⁻¹; 20 kg Mg ha⁻¹ (as dolomitic limestone); 50 kg K ha⁻¹ (as potassium chloride).

## Root sampling
- In each plot (n=32), five root-free ingrowth cores (12 cm diameter, 30 cm deep) installed in August 2017 within the central 30 m × 30 m area.
- Cores collected every three months; five cores homogenised per plot and per soil depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; total n=64 samples).
- Only fine roots from the interval November 2017–February 2018 (wet season middle) used.
- Root extraction performed in 60 minutes, divided into four blocks of 15 minutes; after sampling, root-free soil reinserted.
- To estimate total root biomass, Michaelis–Menten asymptotic curve used to extrapolate from 60 to 180 minutes.

## Root subsampling
- Fine roots from both depths (<2 mm diameter) used for morphological traits; dried at 60°C to determine dry root mass.

## Root morphology
- Fine roots cleaned and a random quarter of biomass scanned at ~600 dpi.
- Images analyzed with WinRHIZO to obtain: mean diameter, total length, surface area, and volume.
- Derived metrics:
  - Specific root length (SRL) = root length per unit dry mass (cm g⁻¹).
  - Specific root area (SRA) = root surface area per unit dry mass (cm² g⁻¹).
  - Root tissue density (RTD) = root dry mass per unit volume (g cm⁻³).

## Spreadsheet details
- Data fields include:
  - Block, Plot (identifying block 1–4 and plot 1–8 within each block).
  - TRT (nutrient treatment: eight levels as described).
  - Depth (0–10 cm or 10–30 cm).
  - root_volume (cm³); tot_weight (g); SRL (cm g⁻¹); SRA (cm² g⁻¹); RTD (g cm⁻³); diameter (mm).
- Each field described to clarify its meaning and unit.
