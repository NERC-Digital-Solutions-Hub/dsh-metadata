# AFEX Experiment

## Overview
- Location: AFEX project area, Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil.
- Climate: mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% (wet season peaks in April).
- Purpose: a full factorial nutrient addition experiment to study how N, P, and cations (K, Mg, Ca) and their combinations affect soil and rooting processes.
- Design scale: eight treatments with four replicates (32 plots) across four independent blocks; plots are 50 m × 50 m with the central 30 m × 30 m area used for main measurements.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Treatments (8 total): control, N, P, cations (K, Mg, Ca), N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations.
- Plot layout: 4 blocks; each block contains 8 plots, spaced to ensure independence (at least ~250 m between plots).
- Nutrient application: three annual dry-granule applications across the designated plots (specific rates: N 125 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ as urea; P 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ as triple superphosphate; Ca 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹; Mg 20 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ as dolomitic limestone; K 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ as potassium chloride).

## Root sampling and timing
- In each plot (n=32): five 12 cm-diameter, 30 cm-deep ingrowth cores installed in the central 30 m × 30 m area (August 2017).
- Sampling schedule: cores collected every three months; for this study, focusing on fine roots produced between Nov 2017 and Feb 2018 (wet season middle).
- Replication and depth: root sampling pooled by plot and soil depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm), resulting in N=64 core samples.

## Root processing and morphology
- Extraction: root-free soil cores manually processed for 60 minutes; remaining soil reinserted; cumulative biomass estimated from 60-minute sampling using Michaelis–Menten extrapolation to 180 minutes.
- Subsampling: fine roots (<2 mm) used for morphological analysis; dry mass determined after drying at 60°C.
- Morphology measurements: roots scanned at 600 dpi; analyzed with WinRHIZO to obtain:
  - Root mean diameter
  - Total root length
  - Root area
  - Root volume
  - Specific Root Length (SRL = cm g⁻¹)
  - Specific Root Area (SRA = cm² g⁻¹)
  - Root Tissue Density (RTD = g cm⁻³)

## Data and outputs
- Depths analyzed: 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm.
- Key output metrics (per plot/depth): root volume (cm³), total root dry weight (g), SRL (cm g⁻¹), SRA (cm² g⁻¹), RTD (g cm⁻³), mean diameter (mm).
- Data structure: includes Block, Plot, Treatment (TRT), Depth, root_volume, tot_weight, SRL, SRA, RTD, diameter for standardized tracking and analysis.

## Data handling and references
- Data management: standardized procedures to ensure data are verifiable and comparable across plots and time; measurements stored with clear block/plot identifiers and treatment codes; results intended for portal upload.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized, replicate-based root morphometrics under controlled nutrient amendments to assess ecosystem responses.
- Enables integration with other environmental datasets (e.g., soil nutrients, carbon flux) to enhance monitoring of forest functionality and policy-relevant environmental health indicators.
