# Long-term experiment on vegetation management by grazing and rotational burning on blanket bog at Hard Hill, Moor House NNR

## Overview
- A long-term ecological experiment on upland blanket bog vegetation management using grazing and rotational burning, aimed at understanding effects on vegetation, hydrology, carbon dynamics, and related ecosystem services (carbon sequestration, drinking water, livestock, sporting interests).
- Located at Hard Hill, Moor House National Nature Reserve in the north Pennines; initiated in 1954 and monitored by Natural England (and predecessors) with Environmental Change Network (ECN) involvement through CEH since 1982.

## Spatial design and data structure
- Experimental layout: four replicate blocks, each 90 m × 60 m, subdivided into six 30 m × 30 m cells (total of 24 experimental units).
- Treatments per block:
  - Grazing: fenced vs grazed (two grazing treatments).
  - Burning: three rotation regimes (burnt in 1954 only; burnt at 20-year intervals; burnt at 10-year intervals) — implemented in a randomized block split-plot design.
- Grid and boundaries provide a clear geospatial framework for mapping treatments and sampling locations.

## Data collection, methods, and time series
- Early sampling: following the initial burn, a quadrat survey (25 quadrats per plot) conducted after 7 seasons of regrowth (1961).
- No-burn plots: a second quadrat survey (10 quadrats per plot) conducted after 11 seasons (1965).
- Long-term monitoring: since 1972, plots monitored via pin frame method at roughly 10-year intervals.
- Temporal coverage highlights:
  - Last five 10-year surveys of plots burnt in 1954.
  - Last five of the six cycles of the 10-year burn rotation.
  - Three complete cycles of the 20-year burn rotation plus two intermediate 10-year time points.
- Surveys are timed to the eighth growing season following a 10-year burn, conducted in late July to early August to minimize seasonal growth variation.

## Data use and relevance for GIS
- Data provide multi-decadal, spatially explicit records suitable for:
  - Mapping treatments (grazing, burning) across the 24 blocks/cells.
  - Locating sampling sites (quadrat and pin-frame positions) within each plot.
  - Temporal analyses of vegetation change, hydrological responses, and carbon-related metrics across burn rotations.
- Related research outputs cover hydrology, soil water chemistry, dissolved organic carbon, carbon budgets, vegetation changes, and greenhouse gas fluxes, enabling integrated GIS analyses with environmental variables.

## Data sources, stewardship, and accessibility
- Monitoring and data stewardship by Natural England (and predecessors) with ECN/CEH involvement since 1982.
- Rich, long-running dataset suitable for spatial and temporal GIS products across multiple decades.

## Key considerations for GIS work
- Data integration across resolutions and time points (plot-level vs quadrat-level data; 25 vs 10 quadrats per plot).
- Maintaining consistent georeferencing for blocks, cells, and sampling points; aligning temporal records with burn rotation cycles.
- Cross-referencing with external datasets (hydrology, soil water, carbon fluxes) for enriched spatial analyses.
