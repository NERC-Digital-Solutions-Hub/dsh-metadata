# Abstract: Moorlands and in particular blanket bogs which occur on peats with a depth greater than 0.5m are of high priority conservation interest.

## Overview
- Long-term ecological experiment focused on blanket bogs in Moor House National Nature Reserve, north Pennines.
- Initiated in 1954 to study effects of grazing and long-term rotational burning on bog vegetation.
- Maintained by Natural England (and predecessor bodies); monitored since 1982 by Environmental Change Network (ECN) through the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).
- Highlights the importance of moorlands for ecosystem services: carbon sequestration, drinking water, sheep grazing, and Red grouse shooting.
- Provides a multi-decadal data resource for understanding management impacts on peatland systems.

## Study Design and Data Collection
- Experimental layout: four replicate blocks (90 m x 60 m), each divided into six 30 m x 30 m cells.
- Treatments: two grazing regimes per block (fenced vs grazed) and three burning regimes (burnt in 1954 only; burnt every 20 years; burnt every 10 years) for six total treatments, arranged in a randomized block split-plot design.
- Early data collection:
  - Quadrat surveys after 7 regrowth seasons (1961) across plots.
  - No-burn plots sampled after 11 regrowth seasons (1965) using 10 quadrats per plot.
- Ongoing monitoring since 1972:
  - Pin-frame method at approximately 10-year intervals.
  - Data coverage includes:
    - Last five 10-year surveys of plots burnt in 1954.
    - Last five surveys of the six 10-year burn cycles.
    - Three complete cycles of the 20-year burn rotation plus two intermediate 10-year points within that rotation.
- Sampling timing is aligned with the eighth growing season following a 10-year burn, conducted in late July to early August to reduce seasonal variation.

## Data Management and Metadata
- Data collected through established vegetation monitoring methods (quadrats and pin frames) over decades, enabling long-term time-series analyses.
- Data are tied to specific treatment combinations (grazing and burning regimes) and spatial blocks, supporting comparative analyses across management scenarios.
- Related literature provides context on hydrological, chemical, and carbon-related responses in peatland systems under similar management.

## Uses and Implications
- Supports understanding of how grazing and prescribed burning affect blanket bog vegetation, carbon budgets, soil water chemistry, and hydrology.
- Informs conservation and land-management decisions for peatland ecosystems and their ecosystem services.
- Serves as a valuable data resource for researchers examining long-term ecological responses to management regimes.

## Data Quality and Challenges for Data Leaders
- Potential data challenges:
  - Maintaining consistency across long time spans with evolving measurement techniques.
  - Ensuring complete metadata for site blocks, plots, treatments, and sampling methods to support discoverability and reuse.
  - Handling data gaps or irregular sampling points while preserving comparability across regimes.
- Opportunities:
  - Coordinated data stewardship with Natural England and CEH to maintain discoverability, metadata completeness, and updates.
  - Leveraging the data for cross-disciplinary analyses (hydrology, carbon cycling, vegetation dynamics) within a broader data community.
