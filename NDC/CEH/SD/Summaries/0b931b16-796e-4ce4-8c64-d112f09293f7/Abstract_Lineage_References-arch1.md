Moorlands and in particular blanket bogs which occur on peats with a depth greater than 0.5m are of high priority conservation interest.

## Overview
- Long-term field experiment at Hard Hill on the Moor House National Nature Reserve (north Pennines) to study effects of vegetation management by grazing and long-term rotational burning on blanket bog vegetation.
- Initiated in 1954; ongoing monitoring by Natural England and its predecessors, with Environmental Change Network involvement through CEH since 1982.
- Focuses on ecosystem services provided by moorlands, including carbon sequestration, drinking water, livestock production, and gaming interests (Red grouse).

## Experimental design (Lineage)
- Four replicate blocks (90 m × 60 m), divided into six 30 m × 30 m cells.
- Treatments:
  - Grazing: two levels (fenced and grazed).
  - Burning: three levels (burnt in 1954 only; burnt at 20-year intervals; burnt at 10-year intervals).
- Randomized block split-plot design.
- Initial data collection after 7 seasons of regrowth for plots burnt in 1954; no-burn plots surveyed after 11 seasons.
- Since 1972, monitoring via pin frame method at ~10-year intervals.

## Data collection and monitoring timeline
- Quadrat surveys (early-stage data) following re-growth: 1961 for burnt plots; 1965 for no-burn plots.
- Pin frame vegetation monitoring occurs approximately every decade, aligned with the eighth growing season after a 10-year burn cycle.
- Timing: surveys conducted in late July to early August to minimize seasonal variation.

## Data scope and structure
- Data span includes:
  - The last five 10-year surveys of plots burnt in 1954.
  - The last five surveys across the six cycles of the 10-year burn rotation.
  - Three complete cycles of the 20-year burn rotation, plus two intermediate time points within the 20-year rotation.
- Data types inferred: vegetation composition and structure from quadrats; soil/vegetation changes via pin-frame measurements; temporal progression across multiple burn cycles and grazing treatments.

## Practical implications for analysis
- Provides a robust, replicated, long-term dataset suitable for analyzing:
  - Interactions between grazing and burning on blanket bog vegetation dynamics.
  - Long-term trends in carbon-related metrics and hydrological/soil-water changes under different management regimes.
  - Temporal lag effects and recovery trajectories following burns in combination with grazing.
- Data quality considerations:
  - Longitudinal data with multiple time points across parallel treatments.
  - Alignment of sampling with growth stages to reduce seasonal bias.
  - Potentially integrated datasets combining quadrat data, pin-frame measurements, and external hydrological/soil chemistry data.

## Data management and access notes
- Monitoring and data collection coordinated by Natural England (and predecessors) and CEH (ECN involvement); dataset lineage documented through repeated surveys and standardized methods.
- Related literature provides methodological context and potential covariates for analysis (e.g., climate, soil water chemistry, carbon fluxes).
