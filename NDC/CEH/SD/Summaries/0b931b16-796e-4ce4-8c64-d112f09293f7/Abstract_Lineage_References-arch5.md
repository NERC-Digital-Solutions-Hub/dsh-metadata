# Abstract: Moorlands and in particular blanket bogs which occur on peats with a depth greater than 0.5m are of high priority conservation interest.

## Overview
- Long-term ecological experiment on moorlands, focusing on blanket bogs, initiated in 1954 at Hard Hill, Moor House NNR (north Pennines).
- Purpose: investigate effects of vegetation management by grazing and long-term rotational burning on blanket bog vegetation.
- Stewardship: maintained by Natural England (and predecessors) and monitored since 1982 by the Environmental Change Network (ECN) through the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).
- Relevance: informs ecosystem services (carbon sequestration, drinking water, sheep grazing, Red grouse shooting) and vegetation dynamics under management.

## Experimental design and lineage
- Structure: four replicate blocks; each block contains two grazing treatments (fenced vs grazed) and three rotational burning treatments (burnt in 1954 only, burnt at 20-year intervals, burnt at 10-year intervals) for a total of six treatments.
- Design: randomized block split-plot.
- Early data collection: after initial burn, quadrat surveys (25 quadrats per plot) in 1961 after 7 regrowth seasons; for no-burn plots, an additional survey after 11 regrowth seasons (1965).
- Ongoing monitoring: since 1972, plots monitored with pin frame method at roughly 10-year intervals.

## Data collection, timing, and temporal coverage
- Data types and timepoints:
  - Quadrat survey data from the early post-burn period (1961) and 1965 for no-burn plots.
  - Long-term vegetation monitoring using pin frames at ~10-year intervals from 1972 onward.
- Coverage across burn regimes:
  - Last five of the five 10-year surveys for plots burnt in 1954.
  - Last five observations from the six cycles of 10-year burn rotation.
  - Three complete cycles of the 20-year burn rotation plus two intermediate 10-year points within the 20-year rotation.
- Sampling season and timing: monitoring conducted to coincide with the eighth growing season following a 10-year burn; surveys performed in late July to early August to minimize seasonal variation.

## Data documentation and provenance
- Related publications provide methodological context and data interpretation:
  - Several hydrology, carbon, and vegetation studies (e.g., 2009–2013) examining burning, grazing, soil water, DOC, carbon budgets, and vegetation changes.
  - Earlier guides on recording methods and database structure (Marrs et al., 1986) and subsequent analyses (Milligan et al., 2018) on long-term intervention effects.
- Documentation supports traceability of treatments, survey methods, and timepoints.

## Data governance, availability, and stewardship considerations
- Data lineage tied to a long-running, multi-decadal field experiment with evolving measurement techniques (quadrats → pin frames).
- Data stewardship needs:
  - Preserve detailed metadata on experimental design (blocks, treatments, randomization, plot coordinates, grazing status, burn schedules).
  - Maintain temporal series integrity across method changes and varying survey intervals.
  - Ensure clear data provenance linking to published analyses and supporting documentation.
  - Manage access and any potential sharing restrictions, given institutional stewardship by NE and CEH.

## Practical implications and use
- Suitable for analyses of long-term vegetation responses to grazing and burn regimes on blanket bogs.
- Enables examination of seasonal timing, treatment effects, and inter-annual trends in plant communities and associated ecosystem processes.
- Valuable for cross-referencing with related hydrology and carbon studies to understand integrated ecosystem responses.

## Key challenges for data stewards
- Integrating data across multiple measurement methods (quadrats, pin frames) and changing protocols over decades.
- Maintaining consistent identifiers for blocks, plots, and treatments across time.
- Handling potential data gaps or uneven temporal coverage due to long-term maintenance and methodological shifts.
