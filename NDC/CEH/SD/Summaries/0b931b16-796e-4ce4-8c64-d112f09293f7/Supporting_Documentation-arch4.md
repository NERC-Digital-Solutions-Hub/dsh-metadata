# Long-term vegetation monitoring data from the Hard Hill burning plots, Moor House, 1954-2013. Rose, R.J., Marrs, R.H., O'Reilly, J. & Furness, M.

## Overview
- A long-term dataset studying the effects of rotational burning and grazing on blanket bog vegetation at Moor House NNR from 1954 to 20111.
- Experimental design comprises four blocks (A–D) with altitude differences, arranged in a randomized split-plot layout to test fenced (grazing-excluded) vs unfenced grazing and three burning regimes.
- Burning treatments introduced in 1954 and subsequently rotated: no burning (N), long-rotation burn (L, ~20-year intervals), and short-rotation burn (S, ~10-year intervals). Burns occur in winter under suitable conditions.
- Data are collected to understand vegetation responses over time, with attention to data quality, format, metadata, and accessibility for cross-study comparisons and wider data-community collaboration.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Four replicate blocks (A–D) on a slope with altitude range 594–625 m.
- Each block split into fenced and unfenced strips, subdivided into three 30 m × 30 m cells (total block: 90 m × 60 m; each strip 90 m × 30 m).
- Sub-treatments within strips: NF (no burn, unfenced), SF (short rotation burn, unfenced), LF (long rotation burn, unfenced), NF (no burn, fenced), SF (short rotation burn, fenced), LF (long rotation burn, fenced).
- Management was designed to remove surface vegetation/litter during burns without deep peat burning.

## Sampling regimes and data collection
- Initial vegetation recording (1961 and 1965) used a quadrat method with the DOMIN cover scale:
  - 1961: 25 1 m² quadrats per block (grid-based positioning).
  - 1965: 10 quadrats per plot (recording points 6–15); same DOMIN scale.
- DOMIN cover estimates range from 1 to 9 (with negative and partial coverage indicating abundance).
- From 1972 onwards, vegetation is recorded using pin quadrats (8th growing season in July–August) across 82 1 m × 1 m quadrats per plot.
  - Each 30 m × 30 m cell contains a central sampling plot (14 m × 6 m) with 7 transects and 6 quadrats per transect.
  - A 1 m pin frame records vertical structure in four height strata (plus an unstratified category for non-vascular plants and other features).
  - Strata: 1 (>30 cm), 2 (20–30 cm), 3 (10–20 cm), 4 (0–10 cm); 99 = unstratified.
  - Data capture distinguishes vascular vs non-vascular plants and uses presence/absence for some data.
- Survey years with pin method: 1972, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2013 (2001 in the 7th season).
- Fieldwork and instrumentation emphasize permanent fences, marked plots, and standardized data collection.

## Data structure and contents
- Quadrat method dataset (1961/1965):
  - Columns: Year; Block (A–D); Treatment (S, L, N); Fenced (UF, F, or grazed); Quadrat (1–25); DOMIN score; Species number (VESPAN); Species name.
- Pin method dataset (1972 onward):
  - Columns: Year (1972, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2013); Block (A–D); Treatment (S, L, N); Fenced (UF, F, or grazed); Stratified (s or u); Transect (1A–7B); Quadrat (1–6); Frame (1–5); Pin; Strata (1–4 or 99); Score (touch counts for vascular plants in stratified data; 1 for non-vascular/unstratified); Species number; Species name.
- Data use of ECN codes: Species numbers align with VESPAN nomenclature in the Environmental Change Network (ECN) database; some historical names updated to current nomenclature.

## Data quality, provenance, and documentation
- Each survey conducted by experienced botanical surveyors in pairs, using consistent methods and equipment.
- Documentation includes a set of miscellaneous supporting documents detailing recording methods, database structures, and long-term vegetation change studies.
- Supporting references and links to ECN guidelines and related reports are provided for traceability and methodological context.

## Accessibility and relevance for data leadership
- Longitudinal, multi-factor experimental design (burn frequency and grazing) across altitude gradients with clearly defined treatments and replication.
- Two complementary data collection methodologies (quadrats for cover estimates in early years; pin-frame height stratification in later years) enabling multi-faceted analyses of vegetation structure and composition over time.
- rich metadata, including block, treatment, fencing status, sampling design, and coding schemes, supports discoverability, re-use, and integration with other datasets (e.g., ECN).
- Supporting documents and references facilitate understanding of methods and data lineage, aiding governance, stewardship, and cross-network collaboration.

## Key opportunities and considerations for use
- Analyze long-term vegetation responses to burning regimes and grazing pressure across spatial and temporal scales.
- Compare early and later data collection methods to study methodological continuity and harmonization needs.
- Leverage standardized metadata and ECN codes to integrate with broader biodiversity and ecosystem datasets.
- Consider data gaps or changes in sampling intensity across years when designing analyses or bias assessments.
