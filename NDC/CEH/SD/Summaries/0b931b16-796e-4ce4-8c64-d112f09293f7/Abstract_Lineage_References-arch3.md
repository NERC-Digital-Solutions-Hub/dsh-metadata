# Moorlands and in particular blanket bogs

- Overview
  - High-priority conservation moorlands on peat (>0.5 m) providing ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, drinking water, sheep grazing, and Red grouse shooting.
  - Long-term management focus on vegetation by grazing and rotational burning.
  - Hard Hill site on Moor House National Nature Reserve, north Pennines; monitored by Environmental Change Network (ECN) via Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) since 1982; long-standing stewardship by Natural England and predecessors.

- Experimental design and treatments
  - Four replicate blocks (90 m x 60 m), each containing six treatments: two grazing treatments (fenced vs grazed) and three burning regimes (burnt in 1954 only; burnt at 20-year intervals; burnt at 10-year intervals).
  - Randomized block split-plot design.
  - Initial data collection included a quadrat survey after 7 seasons of regrowth (1961); no-burn plots surveyed after 11 seasons (1965).

- Monitoring methods and cadence
  - From 1972 onward, plots monitored using the pin-frame method at roughly 10-year intervals.
  - Monitoring aligned with the eighth growing season following a 10-year burn, conducted in late July to early August to minimize seasonal variation.

- Measurements, data, and outputs
  - Vegetation change data from multiple time points:
    - Last five 10-year surveys for plots burnt in 1954.
    - Last five surveys across the six cycles of the 10-year burn rotation.
    - Three complete cycles of the 20-year burn rotation, plus two intermediate 10-year points within that rotation.
  - Broader outputs referenced in related papers include:
    - Hydrological responses to burning and grazing.
    - Effects on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil and runoff.
    - Carbon budgets of blanket bog under prescribed fire.
    - Changes in soil water composition and vegetation-driven soil processes.
    - Long-term vegetation community responses and propagule banks.

- Related literature and evidence
  - A series of studies (2000–2018) examining hydrology, carbon dynamics, soil water chemistry, and plant community responses to managed burning and grazing on upland blanket bogs.
  - Findings contribute to understanding how rotation length and grazing pressure influence ecosystem services and peatland carbon balance.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a robust, long-term, multi-treatment monitoring framework with replicated, randomized design.
  - Combines qualitative (vegetation surveys) and quantitative (pin-frame) methods across extended time scales to inform policy and management decisions.
  - Highlights the importance of consistent monitoring timing (seasonality) and data lineage for evaluating environmental health outcomes.
  - Indicates data governance aspects implicit in long-term monitoring (data continuity, integration with broader ECN/CEH outputs, and dissemination through peer-reviewed publications).
