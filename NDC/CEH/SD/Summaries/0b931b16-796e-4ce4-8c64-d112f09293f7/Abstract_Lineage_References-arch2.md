# Moorlands and blanket bogs managed by grazing and rotational burning: Hard Hill long-term experiment

- Objective and context
  - Focus on moorlands, especially blanket bogs on peat deeper than 0.5 m, as high-priority conservation areas.
  - Moorlands provide ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, drinking water, sheep grazing, and red grouse shooting.
  - Long-term management using rotational burning and grazing to increase productivity for both sheep and grouse.

- Study site and provenance
  - Location: Hard Hill, Moor House National Nature Reserve, north Pennines.
  - Initiation: 1954.
  - Oversight: Natural England (and predecessor bodies); monitoring since 1982 by the Environmental Change Network (ECN) via the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).

- Experimental design (lineage)
  - Four replicate blocks measuring 90 m by 60 m; each block divided into six 30 m by 30 m cells.
  - Treatments: two grazing regimes (fenced vs grazed) and three burning regimes (burnt in 1954 only; burnt at 20-year intervals; burnt at 10-year intervals).
  - Design: randomized block split-plot with six treatments total.
  - Initial assessment: after the first burn, a quadrat survey (25 quadrats per plot) after 7 growing seasons (1961).
  - No-burn plots: quadrat survey (10 quadrats per plot) after 11 seasons (1965).

- Data collection and monitoring methods
  - Since 1972, plots monitored using the pin frame method at roughly 10-year intervals.
  - Data coverage includes:
    - The last five 10-year surveys of plots burnt in 1954.
    - The last five surveys of the six cycles in the 10-year burn rotation.
    - All three complete cycles of the 20-year burn rotation and two intermediate 10-year points within the 20-year rotation.
  - Timing: monitoring coincides with the eighth growing season following a 10-year burn; surveys occur in late July to early August to minimize seasonal growth variation.

- Outputs and data management
  - Data collected provide insights into vegetation responses to grazing and prescribed burning over multiple decades.
  - Data and datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to ensure accessibility and reuse.

- Related literature and context
  - A body of work investigates hydrological responses, dissolved organic carbon, carbon budgets, soil water changes, vegetation changes, and greenhouse gas fluxes in peatland/bog systems under burning and grazing regimes.
  - Key related studies include:
    - Hydrological responses to managed burning and grazing in upland blanket bog.
    - Effects of managed burning on DOC in soil and runoff after burning.
    - Carbon budgets of upland blanket bog managed by prescribed fire.
    - Changes in soil water and runoff composition after burning.
    - Long-term effects on carbon sequestration and vegetation in Pennine blanket bogs.
    - Studies on propagule banks, vegetation change, and management practices at Moor House NNR.
    - Broader considerations of warming effects on greenhouse gas fluxes modulated by vegetation, and related methodological guidance.

- Practical challenges (alignment with the Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype)
  - Increasing the value of monitoring datasets by integrating with additional relevant data sources (avoiding single-use outputs).
  - Facilitating access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs for broader scrutiny and reuse.
