# Moorlands and blanket bogs long-term experiment at Hard Hill, Moor House National Nature Reserve

- Overview
  - Focuses on high-priority conservation blanket bogs on peat >0.5 m depth.
  - Investigates vegetation management by grazing and long-term rotational burning and associated ecosystem services (carbon sequestration, water supply, livestock, sporting interests).
  - Long-term experiment initiated in 1954, maintained by Natural England and monitored by the Environmental Change Network (CEH) since 1982.

- Experimental design (Lineage)
  - Four replicate blocks (90 m x 60 m), divided into six 30 m x 30 m cells.
  - Two grazing treatments per block: fenced and grazed.
  - Three burning treatments: burnt in 1954 only; burnt every 20 years; burnt every 10 years.
  - Randomized block split-plot design with six treatments in total.
  - Data collection from multiple time points across burning/grazing cycles.

- Monitoring methods and data collection
  - Early surveys: quadrat surveys (initial 25 quadrats per plot in 1961; no-burn plots (N) surveyed after 11 seasons in 1965 with 10 quadrats per plot).
  - Since 1972: ongoing monitoring using the pin frame method at roughly 10-year intervals.
  - Sampling timing aimed to minimize seasonal variation: surveys conducted in late July to early August, aligning with the eighth growing season after a 10-year burn.

- Data coverage and time points
  - Data include:
    - The last five 10-year surveys of plots burned in 1954.
    - The last five surveys across the six cycles of the 10-year burn rotation.
    - Three complete cycles of the 20-year burn rotation, plus two intermediate 10-year time points within the 20-year rotation.

- Data outputs and potential products
  - Data suitable for analyzing:
    - Effects of grazing and prescribed burning on blanket bog vegetation over decades.
    - Vegetation community changes, soil water relationships, and related ecological dynamics.
  - Related analyses exist on hydrology, dissolved organic carbon, carbon budgets, soil water and runoff composition, and vegetation-propagule dynamics.

- Related literature and data sources
  - Key papers documenting hydrological responses, DOC, carbon budgets, and vegetation changes under burning/grazing regimes.
  - Notable authors: Clay, Worrall, Fraser, Marrs, Rose, Lee, Hobbs, Rawes, and others.
  - Example topics include hydrological responses to managed burning, carbon budgets of blanket bogs, and long-term vegetation change.

- Practical data considerations for use
  - Long-term, multi-method dataset requiring careful alignment of:
    - Treatment regimes (grazing vs fencing; 1954 burn vs repeated burns).
    - Temporal scales (decadal time points, seasonal timing).
  - Data integration potential with related measurements on soil water, runoff, and carbon fluxes from referenced studies.

- Implications for data use and product development
  - Build time-series dashboards and comparative visuals across grazing/burn regimes.
  - Create self-serve datasets for researchers examining long-term ecosystem responses to management.
  - Support meta-analyses of blanket bog dynamics, carbon sequestration, and hydrology under rotational burning and grazing.
