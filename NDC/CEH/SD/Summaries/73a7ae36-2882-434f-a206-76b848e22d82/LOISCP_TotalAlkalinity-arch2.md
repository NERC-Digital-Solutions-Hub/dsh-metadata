# LOIS Core Programme

## Scope and Variables
- Discrete total alkalinity data (units: mg/l HCO3)
- Humber catchment: 13 sites sampled 1993–1997 and 1996–1997
- Tweed catchment: 3 sites sampled 1994–1997
- Site identifiers, locations, and coordinates (examples):
  - Humber: Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1), Swale at Thornton Manor (S2), Ure at Boroughbridge (U3), Nidd at Skip Bridge (N4), Wharfe at Tadcaster (W5), Ouse at Clifton Bridge (O6), Derwent at Bubwith (D7), Aire at Beal Bridge (A8), Calder at Methley Bridge (C9), Don at Sprotborough Bridge (D10), Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11), Ouse at Acaster Malbis (O12)
  - Tweed: Boleside (TW13), Norham (TW14), Ormiston Mill (TW15)
  - Aire at Allerton Bywater (A20)
- Regular data outputs include site-specific measurements and time series for each determinand

## Sampling Regime
- Weekly sampling at each site
- Additional sampling during high flows (approximately one extra sample per month per site)

## Sampling and Measurement Methods
- Sample collection:
  - Narrow-necked HDPE bottle in plastic carrier
  - Collected from bridges where possible; otherwise by immersion near main flow
- Sample processing:
  - Immediate filtration through Whatman 0.45 μm GFC filters upon return to laboratory
- Analysis:
  - Performed on day of collection or arrival
  - Instrument: Metrohm 702 Titrino autosampler with sample changer
- Target analyte:
  - Total alkalinity (as mg/l HCO3)

## Quality Assurance and Control
- Calibration:
  - Standard hydrochloric acid solution calibrated by titration with borax solution
- Instrument calibration:
  - pH electrode calibrated with pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 buffers
- Verification:
  - Duplicate samples analyzed at IFE Windermere (12 months) and at IFE East Stoke
  - Alkalinity measured as part of the chemical harmonisation programme at East Stoke

## Data Quality and Outputs
- Box-and-whisker plots (zip file) provided for each determinand at each site:
  - Show range, median, interquartile range, 1.5 IQR, and outliers
  - Enable prospective users to assess data quality prior to use

## Data Processing and Custodianship
- Analysis carried out by the Analytical Chemistry section, York University (April 1994–February 1997)
