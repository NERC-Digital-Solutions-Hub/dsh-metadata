# LOIS Core Programme

- The dataset contains discrete total alkalinity data for 13 Humber catchment sites (sampled 1993–1997 and 1996–1997) and 3 Tweed catchment sites (sampled 1994–1997). 
- Variable: Total Alkalinity, units of mg/l HCO3.

  - Tweed at Norham (TW14) NGR NT898477
  - Tweed at Ormiston Mill (TW15) NGR NT702280

## Temporal coverage

- Humber sites: regular weekly sampling with more frequent sampling during high flows (approximately one extra sampling per month per site).
- Tweed sites: sampling during 1994–1997 period (specific frequency not detailed beyond general period).

## Data collection and measurement

- Sampling method: water collected with narrow-necked HDPE bottles (from bridges where possible; otherwise by hand in the main flow). 
- Sample handling: filtered immediately on return using Whatman 0.45 μm GFC filters.
- Analysis: titration-based measurement using a Metrohm 702 Titrino autosampler with sample changer; analyses performed day of collection or upon arrival at the laboratory.
- Measurement standardization: quality-control references include calibration of standard HCl with borax; pH electrode calibration at pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 buffers.

## Data quality and QA/QC

- Duplicate analyses: conducted at IFE Windermere for 12 months and at IFE East Stoke to compare inter-lab results.
- Harmonisation: alkalinity measured as part of the IFE chemical harmonisation program at East Stoke.
- Data quality product: zip file containing box-and-whisker plots for each determinand, illustrating range, median, interquartile range, 1.5 IQR, and outliers to aid user evaluation.

## Data products and access

- Primary data product: box-and-whisker plots (zip file) for each determinand to help prospective users assess data quality.
- Data provenance: analyses conducted by the analytical chemistry section, York University (April 1994 – February 1997).
