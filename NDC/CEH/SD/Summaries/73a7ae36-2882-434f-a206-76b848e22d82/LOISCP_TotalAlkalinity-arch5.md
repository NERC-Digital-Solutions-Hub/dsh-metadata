# LOIS Core Programme

## Overview
- Discrete total alkalinity data collected for 16 sites across Humber catchment (13 Humber sites) and Tweed catchment (3 sites) spanning 1993–1997 (Humber: 1993–1997 and 1996–1997; Tweed: 1994–1997).
- Primary variable: Total Alkalinity, Units: mg/l HCO3.
- Includes site-wise coordinates and identifiers, with detailed site descriptions (e.g., Swale at Catterick Bridge S1; Ure at Boroughbridge U3; Tweed sites TW13–TW15; Aire at Allerton Bywater A20, etc.).

## Variables and units
- Variable: Total Alkalinity (reported within the broader dataset as “All variables” per site entry).
- Units: mg/l HCO3.

## Location and sampling framework
- Locations and site identifiers are provided (e.g., Swale at Catterick Bridge S1; Thornton Manor S2; Ure at Boroughbridge U3; Nidd at Skip Bridge N4; Wharfe at Tadcaster W5; Ouse at Clifton Bridge O6; Derwent at Bubwith D7; Aire at Beal Bridge A8; Calder at Methley Bridge C9; Don at Sprotborough Bridge D10; Trent at Cromwell Lock T11; Ouse at Acaster Malbis O12; Tweed sites TW13–TW15; Aire at Allerton Bywater A20).
- Coordinates (NGR) are provided for each site.

## Temporal coverage and sampling regime
- Sampling cadence: regular weekly intervals with more intermittent sampling during high-flow conditions (approximately an extra sampling per site per month during such periods).

## Sampling and analysis methods
- Sample collection: narrow-necked HDPE bottles (collected from bridges where possible; otherwise by hand near main flow).
- Filtration: immediate filtration on return to laboratory through Whatman 0.45 μm GFC filters.
- Analysis: lab analysis on day of collection or arrival using Metrohm 702 Titrino autosampler.
- Quality control (in-field/initial QC): standard HCl solution calibrated by titration with borax; pH electrode calibrated with pH 4.0 and 7.0 buffers.

## Quality assurance and data quality
- Duplicate samples analyzed at IFE Windermere and IFE East Stoke for cross-laboratory comparison over a 12-month period.
- Alkalinity measured as part of the IFE chemical harmonisation programme at East Stoke.
- Data quality indicators provided via a zip file of box-and-whisker plots for each determinand, showing median, interquartile range, 1.5 IQR, and outliers to aid user assessment.

## Provenance and references
- Analyses conducted by the analytical chemistry section at York University (April 1994 – February 1997).

## Data products and access
- Box-and-whisker plots (zip file) accompany the dataset to illustrate data quality and variability across sites.
- The document outlines measurement methods, QA/QC procedures, and provenance to support data discovery, reuse, and governance.

## Data stewardship considerations
- Metadata should include site codes, site names, NGR coordinates, sampling dates, analyte (total alkalinity), units, measurement method, QA/QC procedures, and data provenance.
- Document data quality indicators and provide access to the QA plots to facilitate assessment of data suitability for reuse.
- Capture historical context (1993–1997 for Humber; 1994–1997 for Tweed) and acknowledge multiple laboratories and harmonisation efforts that may affect comparability.
