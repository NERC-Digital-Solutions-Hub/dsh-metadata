# LOIS Core Programme

- Overview
  - Discrete total alkalinity data collected for 13 sites in the Humber catchment (samples from 1993–1997 and 1996–1997) and 3 sites in the Tweed catchment (1994–1997).
  - Variable: Total Alkalinity; Units: mg/l HCO3.

- Content and scope
  - Sites and identifiers:
    - Humber catchment: S1 Swale at Catterick Bridge; S2 Swale at Thornton Manor; U3 Ure at Boroughbridge; N4 Nidd at Skip Bridge; W5 Wharfe at Tadcaster; O6 Ouse at Clifton Bridge; D7 Derwent at Bubwith; A8 Aire at Beal Bridge; C9 Calder at Methley Bridge; D10 Don at Sprotborough Bridge; T11 Trent at Cromwell Lock; O12 Ouse at Acaster Malbis.
    - Tweed catchment: TW13 Tweed at Boleside; TW14 Tweed at Norham; TW15 Tweed at Ormiston Mill; A20 Aire at Allerton Bywater.
  - Temporal coverage:
    - Humber sites: 1993–1997 and 1996–1997.
    - Tweed sites: 1994–1997.
  - Sampling frequency: regular weekly intervals; more frequent during high flows (approximately one extra sampling per month per site).

- Sampling and measurement methods
  - Sample collection: narrow-necked HDPE bottle in a plastic carrier; from bridges when possible or by hand in water near main flow.
  - Filtration: Whatman 0.45 μm GFC filters immediately upon return to the laboratory.
  - Analysis: conducted on the day of collection or arrival using a Metrohm 702 Titrino autosampler.

- Quality control and data quality
  - Calibration: standard hydrochloric acid solution calibrated by titration with borax; pH electrode calibrated with pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 buffers.
  - Data quality checks: duplicate samples analyzed at IFE Windermere (12 months) and at IFE East Stoke; alkalinity also measured under the IFE chemical harmonisation programme at East Stoke.
  - Data quality presentation: zip file of box-and-whisker plots for each determinand, showing site-specific value ranges (median, IQR, outliers) to aid interpretation of data quality.

- Data provenance and access
  - Measured by: analytical chemistry section, York University (April 1994 – February 1997).
  - Documentation and references: SOP for Determination of Total Alkalinity by Gran Titration (House et al. 1993); major ion and inorganic carbon studies by Jarvie et al. (1997); summary of UK river water quality data by Neal & Robson (2000).
