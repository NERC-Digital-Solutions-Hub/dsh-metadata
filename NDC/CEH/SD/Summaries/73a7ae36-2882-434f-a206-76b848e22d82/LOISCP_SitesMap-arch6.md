# Data Support

## Overview
- Aim to support others in exploring data and obtaining useful insights by finding, combining, analysing data, and creating data products for others to explore readily.
- Bring data analysis and communication skills to support data use across a broad range of topics.
- Often work for organisations with less specialised remits (e.g., local councils or private companies).

## Who they are
- Possess data analysis and communication skills, focusing on a broad range of topics rather than deep specialisation.
- Often employed by less specialised organisations (local councils or private companies).
- Support policy work and sometimes communicate data publicly.

## How they meet their aims
- Understand the ask: determine what is needed, why, and the best way to meet those needs.
- Find and verify sufficient data, potentially seeking help from topic experts.
- Quality assure, clean, and transform data into appropriate formats; combine datasets.
- Analyse patterns to identify significant features.
- Create products (e.g., dashboards or pivot tables) to enable end users to self-serve, or produce reports and charts with guidance on usage.
- Promote outputs and gather feedback to develop products further; may share early prototypes.
- May advocate for better data creation.

## Particular Challenges
- Time spent understanding the ask due to a lack of data consideration in wider teams.
- Working with patchy data across a wide range of formats.
- Accessing different systems to locate and access data.
- Difficulty communicating complex information simply.
- Promoting outputs to ensure they are used; concerns that outputs are not as widely shared or re-used as they could be.
