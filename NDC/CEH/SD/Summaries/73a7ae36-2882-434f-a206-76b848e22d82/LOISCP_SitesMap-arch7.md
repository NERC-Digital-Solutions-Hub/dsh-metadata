# HUMBER CATHCMENT

## Who are GIS Specialists and what they aim to do
- Data analysts focused on Geographical Information Systems (GIS) who create map-based visualisations for audiences such as policy colleagues, clients, and the public.
- Aim to produce data products in map formats that help their audience readily understand and explore relevant information.

## How they meet their aims (key practices)
- Work closely with end users to understand audience needs.
- Locate and verify data appropriate for the intended purpose.
- Clean, transform, and quality assure data; combine datasets, often across different resolutions.
- Analyse data to identify significant features and determine effective presentation.
- Present data in map formats using GIS to clearly illustrate spatial features.
- Test early prototypes and iterate based on feedback.

## Particular challenges to anticipate
- Reactive requests that don’t account for data constraints.
- Data scattered across many places and systems.
- Gaps or lack of data at suitable resolutions.
- Inconsistent data standards.
- Large or complex datasets not easily packaged into manageable chunks.
- The effort required for data cleaning and transformation.
- Ensuring teams have or develop sufficient skills.

## Implications for Humber Catchment (project-specific context)
- The label “HUMBER CATHCMENT” suggests a focus on the Humber catchment area.
- Apply the above practices to boundary definitions, hydrological features, and catchment-scale data from multiple sources.
- Prioritize data quality, appropriate resolution, and standardized formats to support clear, map-based visualisations for stakeholders (policy colleagues, clients, public).
- Plan for iterative development with end-user feedback to refine catchment-related products.
