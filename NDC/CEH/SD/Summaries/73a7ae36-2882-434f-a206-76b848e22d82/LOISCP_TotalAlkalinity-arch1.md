# LOIS Core Programme

## Overview
- Discrete total alkalinity data for 16 sites: 13 in the Humber catchment (1993–1997) and 3 in the Tweed catchment (1994–1997).
- Variable: Total Alkalinity, units = mg/l HCO3.
- Sites and identifiers (all variables measured at each site):
  - S1 Swale at Catterick Bridge (NGR SE225994)
  - S2 Swale at Thornton Manor (SE433715)
  - U3 Ure at Boroughbridge (SE395671)
  - N4 Nidd at Skip Bridge (SE482561)
  - W5 Wharfe at Tadcaster (SE487435)
  - O6 Ouse at Clifton Bridge (SE589528)
  - D7 Derwent at Bubwith (SE706364)
  - A8 Aire at Beal Bridge (SE534255)
  - C9 Calder at Methley Bridge (SE409258)
  - D10 Don at Sprotborough Bridge (SE538014)
  - T11 Trent at Cromwell Lock (SK807612)
  - O12 Ouse at Acaster Malbis (SE594445)
  - TW13 Tweed at Boleside (NT498334)
  - TW14 Tweed at Norham (NT898477)
  - TW15 Tweed at Ormiston Mill (NT702280)
  - A20 Aire at Allerton Bywater (SE417274)

## Sampling and Timing
- Sites sampled at regular weekly intervals; during high flows, sampling was more intermittent (approximately one extra sample per month per site).

## Methods
- Sample collection: narrow-necked HDPE bottle, transported in a plastic carrier; collected from bridges when possible; otherwise by hand at main flow.
- Sample processing: filtered on return using Whatman 0.45 µm GFC filters.
- Analysis: performed on day of collection or arrival using a Metrohm 702 Titrino autosampler with sample changer.
- Quantification: Total Alkalinity via Gran Titration (reference SOP).

## Quality Control and Data Quality
- QA: standard hydrochloric acid solution calibrated by titration against borax; pH electrode calibrated with pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 buffers.
- Data quality: duplicate samples analyzed at IFE Windermere (12 months) and at IFE East Stoke for inter-lab comparison; TA also measured as part of the IFE chemical harmonisation program at East Stoke.
- Data quality transparency: a zip file of box-and-whisker plots for each determinand is provided to show range, median, quartiles, and outliers.

## Data Provenance and References
- Analyzed by the analytical chemistry section at York University (April 1994 – February 1997).

## Data Use and Accessibility
- The dataset supports analyses of alkalinity patterns, correlations, and predictive modeling of river carbon chemistry.
- Data products include documented datasets with metadata, and a box-and-whisker plots package to aid assessment of data quality.
