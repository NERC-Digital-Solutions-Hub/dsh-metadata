# LOIS Core Programme

## Overview
- Discrete total alkalinity data for 13 Humber catchment sites (sampled 1993–1997) and 3 Tweed catchment sites (sampled 1994–1997).
- Determinand: Total Alkalinity, units mg/L as HCO3.
- Data designed to support understanding of river alkalinity and inorganic carbon chemistry across multiple sites.

## Datasets and Determinands
- Total Alkalinity (mg/L as HCO3) measured at multiple river sites.
- Sites include a mix of Humber River and Tweed River locations with specific site codes (e.g., S1, S2, U3, N4, W5, O6, D7, A8, C9, D10, T11, O12; TW13, TW14, TW15, A20).

## Sites and Sampling
- Humber catchment: Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1); Swale at Thornton Manor (S2); Ure at Boroughbridge (U3); Nidd at Skip Bridge (N4); Wharfe at Tadcaster (W5); Ouse at Clifton Bridge (O6); Derwent at Bubwith (D7); Aire at Beal Bridge (A8); Calder at Methley Bridge (C9); Don at Sprotborough Bridge (D10); Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11); Ouse at Acaster Malbis (O12).
- Tweed catchment: Tweed at Boleside (TW13); Tweed at Norham (TW14); Tweed at Ormiston Mill (TW15); Aire at Allerton Bywater (A20).
- Sampling frequency: weekly, with additional sampling during high-flow periods (roughly one extra sample per month per site during higher flows).

## Methods
- Sample collection: Narrow-necked HDPE bottles, lowered from bridges when possible; otherwise hand-sampled near main flow.
- Filtration: Immediate filtration in the lab through Whatman 0.45 µm filters.
- Analysis: Day-of-collection or arrival analysis using a Metrohm 702 Titrino autosampler.

## Quality Control and Data Quality
- Calibration: Standard HCl solution calibrated by titration with borax; pH electrode calibrated at pH 4.0 and pH 7.0.
- Inter-lab quality checks: Duplicate samples analyzed at IFE Windermere (12-month period) and at IFE East Stoke for inter-lab comparison; alkalinity also measured as part of the IFE chemical harmonisation programme at East Stoke.
- Data quality presentation: Zip file of box-and-whisker plots for each determinand showing range, median, interquartile range, 1.5 times IQR, and outliers to aid users in assessing data quality.

## Data Provenance and Availability
- Analysis conducted by the analytical chemistry section at York University (April 1994–February 1997).
- Outputs include data suitable for self-serve use; accompanying box-and-whisker plots provide quality context.
