# LOIS Core Programme

- Purpose and scope
  - Discrete total alkalinity data for Humber catchment (13 sites) during 1993–1997 and Tweed catchment (3 sites) during 1994–1997.
  - Variable: Total Alkalinity; Units: mg/l HCO3.
- Sites and temporal coverage
  - Humber catchment: 13 sites including S1, S2, U3, N4, W5, O6, D7, A8, C9, D10, T11, O12, A20.
  - Tweed catchment: TW13, TW14, TW15.
  - Sampling cadence: weekly intervals with more frequent sampling during high flows (approximately one extra sample per site per month during high flows).
- Measurement and sampling methods
  - Samples collected using narrow-necked HDPE bottles placed in plastic carriers; where possible taken from bridges, otherwise by hand near main flow.
  - On return, samples filtered through Whatman 0.45 µm filters.
  - Analysis conducted on day of collection or arrival using a Metrohm 702 Titrino autosampler with sample changer.
- Data quality and QA/QC
  - Calibration: standard HCl solution calibrated by titration with borax; pH electrode calibrated with pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 buffers.
  - Quality assurance: duplicate samples analysed at IFE Windermere (12 months) and at IFE East Stoke for inter-lab comparison; alkalinity also measured under the IFE chemical harmonisation programme at East Stoke.
  - Data quality presentation: zip file of box-and-whisker plots for each determinand showing range, median, interquartile range, and outliers to aid understanding of data quality.
- Data processing and governance
  - Analysis performed by the analytical chemistry section at York University (April 1994–February 1997).
  - References provided for methodology and context (SOP for determination of total alkalinity by Gran Titration; related river chemistry studies).
- Outputs and availability
  - Box-and-whisker plots are provided as a zip file for users to assess data quality; the document describes the data and QC but does not explicitly detail data sharing of the underlying raw datasets.
