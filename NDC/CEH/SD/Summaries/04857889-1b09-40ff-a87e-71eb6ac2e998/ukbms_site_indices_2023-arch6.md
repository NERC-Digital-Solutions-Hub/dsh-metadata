# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers underpin the data collection.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status across the UK to understand changes and inform biodiversity policy questions.

## Data collection framework (what is measured and how)

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km) at selected sites, recording all butterflies in a fixed-width band (about 5 m) weekly from early April to late September (up to 26 counts/year). Over 2,000 sites monitored annually by 2022.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (min 2 in July/August). Approximately 800 squares sampled per year.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or habitats.

## Nature of data and trend analysis (how data is turned into usable insights)

- Data are transformed into abundance indices (relative measures rather than absolute counts).
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of the population observed, though detectability varies by species.
- Indices across sites and years are combined using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with a weighting adjustment that accounts for the proportion of the species flight period surveyed at each site/year. This uses all counts to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

## Quality control (data quality processes)

- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker software; uploads go to a central database.
- Automatic checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators review data; ongoing validation checks assess distributions, flight periods, first-time site records, and outliers. Edits are made via queries and coordination with recorders when needed.

## Details of this data download (what you get)

- Provides annual indices of abundance for each species at each site with sufficient data from 1976–2023.
- Delivered as a CSV file.
- Columns explained:
  - SITE_CODE: unique site identifier
