# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Key aims and governance
- Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC; relies on volunteers.
- Provides annual, site-based data on butterfly population status to support biodiversity policy and monitoring.
- Data governance involves standardized data collection, entry, validation, and cataloging across multiple partner organisations.

## Data collection framework
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) from April to September; over 2000 sites monitored yearly as of 2022.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (plus encouraged spring visits); ~800 squares sampled annually.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species.
- Long-running program since 1976 with data from all methods combined for analysis.

## Data types and analysis
- Data are used to generate abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of the population; some species are easier to detect than others.
- Collated species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with 2016 refinements; weighting gives more influence to observed data, accounting for flight-period coverage per site.

## Data quality control and validation
- Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online via UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker before database upload.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators validate data; continuous seasonal checks possible.
- Additional automated and manual validation queries ensure consistency with distribution ranges, flight periods, first-time site records, and unusual abundances; edits are made as needed.

## Data download details and structure
- This download provides annual abundance indices for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, covering 1976–2023, in CSV format.
- Key columns:
  - SITE_CODE (unique site identifier)
  - COUNTRY (region for regional indices)
  - SPECIES_CODE (species identifier)
  - SPECIES (scientific name)
  - COMMON_NAME (vernacular name)
  - YEAR (year of the collated index)
  - SITE_INDEX (abundance index for the species at the site/year; -2 indicates insufficient monitoring for accurate index)
- Taxonomic references cited for species checklists.
