# General information: This dataset contains results from slurry incubations with 15N-labelled substrates.

- Purpose and scope
  - Data capture nitrogen cycling processes in river sediments using 15N-labelled substrates.
  - Focus on comparing anammox, denitrification, and related nitrogen transformations across different sub-catchment sediments (Clay, Sand, Chalk) from Hampshire Avon rivers.
  - Results interpreted as potentials (not absolute in situ rates) based on incubations conducted under controlled, dark, room-temperature conditions.

- Experimental design
  - Slurry preparations
    - Anoxic slurries: 3 mL vials with 1 mL wet sediment, 1 mL synthetic river water, and N2 headspace.
    - Oxic slurries: 12 mL vials with 2.5 mL sediment, 3 mL synthetic river water, and air headspace.
    - Incubations conducted in August 2013; mass spectrometry in September 2013.
  - N-amendments and tracers
    - Injections of 14N (natural abundance) and 15N-labelled substrates; target post-injection nitrate or ammonium concentrations vary by sediment type.
    - 15N-labelled tracers at ~98 atom % 15N.
    - Anoxic slurries pre-incubated overnight before 15N addition to remove ambient 14N nitrate.
  - Experimental treatments
    - Reference samples (no 15N-labelled substrates).
    - Control samples (biological activity halted with zinc chloride before 15N addition).
    - Time-series samples (ZnCl2 added at predetermined times after 15N addition).
  - Incubation conditions and interpretation
    - Incubations in the dark, at room temperature.
    - Outputs interpreted as potential activity, not precise in situ rates.

- Measurements and derived metrics
  - Nitrogen gas production (mass spectrometry)
    - P29 and P30: production rates of 29N2 and 30N2, respectively.
    - p15N: production of 15N-labelled N2, calculated as P29 + 2×P30.
  - Headspace and aqueous calculations
    - Headspace aN2 (nmol) derived from 29N2 and 30N2 signals relative to total N2.
    - Aqueous N2 concentrations computed using Bunsen solubility and total nmoles (headspace + aqueous) per g dry sediment.
  - Rates and totals
    - Rates: determined from time-series plots (slope of 29N2 or 30N2 vs. time) for various treatments.
    - Atotal: total anammox activity (nmol N2 g-1 dwt h-1) using Thamdrup and Dalsgaard equations; FN is 15N-labelling of nitrate (0.98).
    - Dtotal: total denitrification (derived from P30 and 15N_labelling).
    - ra: contribution of anammox to N2 production (%).
  - Isotopic proportion estimates
    - FN-NH4+, FN-NOx, FN-N2: proportions of 15N in ammonium, NOx, and N2 pools, used in mixing models.
  - Oxic slurry time-series specifics
    - Oxicp15N measurements: 15N-labelled N2 produced in oxic slurries post ammonium addition (multiple timepoints: T0, T1, T2, T3, T4).
    - Oxicp15Nrpt measurements: replicates testing nitrification-N2 relationship with a repeat of those measurements on a different occasion.
    - Oxicp15NATU measurements: parallel measurements with allylthiourea (ATU) to inhibit nitrification.
  - Oxygen measurements
    - O2Conc-T0 to T3: dissolved oxygen concentrations in oxic slurries at initiation and after 1, 3, and 6 hours.
  - Reference concentrations
    - AmmoniumRef and NOxRef: concentration measurements in oxic reference slurries via standard colorimetric methods.
  - Time-series headers
    - 15NOxT0 to 15NOxT5: concentrations of 15N-labelled NOx at successive timepoints post-15N nitrate addition.
  - Replication and site metadata
    - Replicate: discrete sediment samples collected from each river with 5 replicates per river.
    - Site labeling: Clay, Sand, Chalk categories correspond to river sub-catchments; specific sites listed with geographic coordinates.
  - Data flags and quality
    - BDL: values below detection limits.
    - Detection limits: specified for P29, P30, and 15N-N2 calculations.
  - Column headers and data structure
    - Data organized in 42 columns and 46 rows (including headers).
    - Detailed descriptions provided for the first column header and applicable time-series headers.
