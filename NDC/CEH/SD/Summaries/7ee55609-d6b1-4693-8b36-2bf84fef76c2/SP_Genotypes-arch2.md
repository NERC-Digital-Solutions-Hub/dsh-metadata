Genotypes for samples used to validate a 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, DNA mutation) Axiom array for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex.

## What has been recorded and what form does the data take?
- Genotypes for samples used to validate a 50K SNP Axiom array for Scots pine and related species (Pinus mugo complex).

## When were the data collected?
- Data assembled during 2016.

## How were the data collected?
- Samples and DNA extraction: Needles dried on silica gel; DNA extracted using Qiagen DNeasy 96 kit; DNA quantified with Qubit to ensure minimum 35 ng/µl; quality checked by 1% agarose gel.
- Genotyping and SNP calling: Performed at Edinburgh Genomics using Affymetrix Axiom assay; genotyping in 384-well format on a GeneTitan; allele calls made with Axiom Analysis Suite.
- Quality thresholds and analysis grouping:
  - Samples assigned to groups based on call rate (CR) and dish QC (DQC).
  - Thresholds: DQC high ≥ 0.82; CR high ≥ 96; DQC low < 0.82; CR low < 96.
  - Analyses groups: 1) DQC high + CR high; 2) DQC high + CR low; 3) DQC low + CR low.
  - High-quality samples (N=529) used to set allele-call thresholds; posteriors for allele calls used as priors for analyses 2 (N=753) and 3 (N=251).

## Why were the data collected? For what purpose?
- To validate a newly manufactured genotyping array for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and close relatives in the Pinus mugo complex.

## Who was responsible for the collection and interpretation of data?
- Stephen Cavers (scav@ceh.ac.uk)
