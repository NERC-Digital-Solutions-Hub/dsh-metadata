# Genotypes for samples used to validate a 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, DNA mutation) Axiom array for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex.

- What the data are
  - Genotypes from samples used to validate a 50K SNP Axiom array for Scots pine and closely related Pinus mugo complex members.
  - Includes genotype calls and thresholds used to assess data quality.
  - High-quality samples and subsequent analyses used to set and refine allele-call thresholds.

- When the data were collected
  - 2016

- How the data were collected
  - Samples and DNA extraction from needles using a Qiagen DNeasy 96 kit; needles dried on silica gel prior to extraction.
  - DNA quantified with a Qubit spectrophotometer to ensure a minimum concentration of 35 ng/µl; DNA quality checked via 1% agarose gel.
  - Genotyping performed at Edinburgh Genomics using the Affymetrix Axiom assay, in 384-well format on a GeneTitan.
  - Genotype calls generated with Axiom Analysis Suite; samples categorized by call rate (CR) and dish QC (DQC) with thresholds:
    - DQC high ≥ 0.82; DQC low < 0.82
    - CR high ≥ 96; CR low < 96
  - Analyses groups: 1) DQC high + CR high; 2) DQC high + CR low; 3) DQC low + CR low
  - High-quality samples (N=529) used to set allele-call thresholds; posteriors for allele calls used as priors for analyses 2 (N=753) and 3 (N=251).

- Why the data were collected
  - For validation of a newly manufactured genotyping array for Scots pine and its close relatives in the Pinus mugo complex.

- Who was responsible for the collection and interpretation of data
  - Stephen Cavers (scav@ceh.ac.uk)
