# Genotypes for samples used to validate a 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, DNA mutation) Axiom array for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex

- What the data are and form
  - Genotypes for samples used to validate a 50K SNP Axiom array for Scots pine and closely related Pinus mugo complex species.
  - Data assembled in 2016.
- How the data were collected
  - Samples & DNA extraction: needles dried on silica gel; DNA extracted with Qiagen DNeasy 96 kit; DNA quantified with Qubit to ensure a minimum concentration of 35 ng/µl; DNA quality checked visually for fragmentation on a 1% agarose gel.
  - Genotyping and SNP calling: performed at Edinburgh Genomics using the Affymetrix Axiom assay protocol; genotyping in 384-well format on a GeneTitan; genotype calls made with Axiom Analysis Suite; sample quality assessed using dish QC (DQC) and call rate (CR) thresholds.
  - Quality thresholds and analysis groups: DQC high ≥ 0.82; CR high ≥ 96; analyses grouped as 1) DQC high + CR high; 2) DQC high + CR low; 3) DQC low + CR low.
  - Sample counts and priors: high-quality samples (N=529) used to set allele-call thresholds; posteriors for allele calls used as priors for analyses 2 (N=753) and 3 (N=251).
- Why the data were collected
  - To validate a newly manufactured genotyping array for Scots pine and close relatives in the Pinus mugo complex.
- Who was responsible
  - Stephen Cavers (scav@ceh.ac.uk).
- Completeness
  - The completeness section exists but no explicit details are provided in the text about data absence or inclusions beyond what is described above.
