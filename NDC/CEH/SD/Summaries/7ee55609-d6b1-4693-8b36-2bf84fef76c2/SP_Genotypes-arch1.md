# Genotypes for samples used to validate a 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, DNA mutation) Axiom array for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex

## What has been recorded and what form does the data take?
- Genotypes for samples used to validate a 50K SNP Axiom array for Scots pine and related Pinus mugo complex species.

## When were the data collected?
- Assembled during 2016.

## How were the data collected?
- Samples & DNA extraction:
  - Subset of 87 samples across four species: Pinus sylvestris (SY), P. mugo (MU), P. uncinata (UN), P. uliginosa (UL).
  - DNA extracted from needles using Qiagen DNeasy 96 kit; needles dried on silica gel prior to extraction.
  - DNA quantified with a Qubit; standardized concentration of ≥35 ng/µl; quality checked by 1% agarose gel.
- Genotyping and SNP calling:
  - Genotyping at Edinburgh Genomics following Affymetrix Axiom Assay protocol.
  - 384-well format on a GeneTitan; genotype calls via Axiom Analysis Suite.
  - Samples assigned to analysis groups by call rate (CR) and dish QC (DQC) using thresholds:
    - DQC: high ≥ 0.82; low < 0.82
    - CR: high ≥ 96%; low < 96
  - Analyses: 1) DQC high + CR high; 2) DQC high + CR low; 3) DQC low + CR low.
  - High-quality samples (N=529) used to set thresholds for allele calls.
  - Posteriors for allele calls used as priors for analyses 2 (N=753) and 3 (N=251).

## Why were the data collected?
- For validation of a newly manufactured genotyping array for Scots pine and closely related Pinus mugo complex members.

## Who was responsible for the collection and interpretation of data?
- Stephen Cavers (scav@ceh.ac.uk)
