# Data description, Measures of peatland carbon cycling from peat mesocosm incubation experiments.

## Overview
- Two laboratory studies on peatland carbon cycling exploring interactive abiotic and biotic controls.
- Study locations: blanket bog peatland at Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland.
- Data types include greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4), litter decomposition rates, and extensive substrate/microbial properties.

## Datasets and content
- First laboratory study
  - CO2 and CH4 fluxes from peat mesocosms (six measurements from Oct 2011–Sept 2012).
  - Supplementary peat samples analyzed for bulk density, pH, total C and N, C:N, C and N stocks, PLFAs, and microbial community indicators (fungal/bacterial PLFAs; F:B; gram-positive to gram-negative ratios).
  - Subsamples for microbial biomarkers (PLFAs) and chemical analyses.
- Second laboratory study
  - Litter decomposition data (litter mass remaining, % initial dry mass) from litter bags placed on peat mesocosms.
  - CO2 emissions/respiration measured six times over 363 days.
  - Initial biochemical composition for peat and litter (C, N, C:N; microbial community composition).
  - Litter treatments included no litter, single-species litter from three plant functional types (PFTs), and mixed litter; four replicates per treatment.
  - Additional measurements of peat and litter C and N, and C:N ratios.

## Experimental design
- First study
  - Fully factorial: three temperatures (12, 14, 16°C), three water table levels (low ~25 cm, intermediate ~15 cm, high ~5 cm), and three PFTs (Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum capillifolium).
  - 36 cores per temperature, with four replicates per treatment combination.
  - Incubation: 322 days.
- Second study
  - Fully factorial: three temperatures (12, 14, 16°C), three peat PFTs, and eight litter bag treatments.
  - 288 cores total; 96 per peat PFT; four replicates per combination.
  - Incubation: 363 days.

## Measurements and instruments
- Gas analysis
  - CO2 and CH4 fluxes measured via Perkins Elmer AutosystemXL GC with FID and methaniser.
  - Headspace sampling from opaque chambers; calibration with certified standards.
  - Fluxes calculated from change in concentration, temperature, chamber volume, and area.
- Litter decomposition and respiration
  - Litter mass remaining determined after drying (oven-dried mass basis).
  - CO2 respiration measured with an EGM-4 IRGA and chamber enclosure; flux calculations based on CO2 concentration changes over time.
- Substrate and microbial analyses
  - Biochemical/physical peat properties: bulk density, pH, total C, total N, C:N, C and N stocks.
  - Microbial community composition via phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) with GC analysis; biomarker-based grouping for Gram-positive/Gram-negative bacteria and fungi (saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal).
  - Initial substrate biochemistry for peat and litter (C, N, C:N) and PLFA profiles for five peat samples per PFT and four litter samples per PFT.

## Data structure and variables
- Time-series gas flux data: CO2 and CH4 fluxes per core across multiple time points.
- Decomposition data: percent litter remaining for each litter bag treatment.
- Substrate properties: BD, pH, total C, total N, C:N, C and N stocks; PLFA-based microbial metrics (F:B, Gram+/Gram- ratios).
- Initial biochemical composition and microbial community data for peat and litter (per PFT).

## Temporal and spatial scope
- Spatial: Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland.
- Temporal coverage: field-collected 2011–2012; experiments spanning 322–363 days.

## Data quality, provenance, and documentation
- Detailed methodologies described, including core collection, incubation setup, temperature and water table manipulations, and measurement protocols.
- Calibration and standard references provided for gas analyses and PLFA measurements.
- Supplementary samples used to anchor substrate properties by plant functional type.

## Use, sharing, and stewardship considerations
- Suitable for analyses of how temperature, water table, and plant functional type legacy influence peat GHG fluxes and decomposition processes.
- Requires careful metadata alignment when integrating with other peatland datasets (consistent units for C, N, C:N; standardized PLFA biomarker interpretation).
- Documentation supports traceability from cores to treatments to measurements; licensing/sharing terms should be confirmed with data custodians.

## Notable limitations
- Incubation-based, laboratory conditions may differ from in situ peatland dynamics; results should be contextualized accordingly.
- Deionised water used for nutrient control may not reflect natural nutrient inputs; consider this in cross-study comparisons.
