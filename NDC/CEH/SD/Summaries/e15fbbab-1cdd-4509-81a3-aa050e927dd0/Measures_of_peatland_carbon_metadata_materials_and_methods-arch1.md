# Data description, Measures of peatland carbon cycling from peat mesocosm incubation experiments

- Purpose and scope
  - Two laboratory studies investigating how abiotic (temperature, water table) and biotic (plant functional type legacy, litter) controls interact to influence peatland carbon cycling.
  - Location: blanket bog peatland at Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland.
  - Data types include greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4), litter decomposition, and comprehensive biochemical/physical properties of peat and litter, plus microbial community biomarkers.

- Study 1: peat carbon fluxes and plant functional type legacy
  - Focus: interactive effects of small-scale temperature change, water table level, and plant functional type (PFT) legacy on CO2 and CH4 fluxes from peat.
  - Materials: peat cores collected May 2011 from beneath three dominant PFTs (Calluna vulgaris – shrub, Eriophorum vaginatum – graminoid, Sphagnum capillifolium – moss).
  - Experimental design: fully factorial with three temperatures (12, 14, 16°C), three water table levels (low 25 cm, intermediate 15 cm, high 5 cm), and three PFTs; 108 cores total distributed across three temperature rooms.
  - Measurements and timing: CO2 and CH4 fluxes measured six times over 322 days (days 7, 35, 154, 223, 322).
  - Additional sampling: supplementary peat samples under each PFT to quantify bulk density, pH, total C and N, C:N, C and N stocks, and soil microbial community composition via PLFAs.
  - Microbial analysis: PLFA profiling to distinguish bacteria vs fungi (gram-positive vs gram-negative bacteria; fungal markers) and overall microbial biomass. Ratios used as indicators of community structure (e.g., fungal:bacterial PLFA, gram+ to gram−).

- Study 2: peat and litter decomposition under temperature and PFT legacy
  - Focus: interactive effects of small-scale temperature change and PFT legacy on decomposition of peat and litter.
  - Materials: peat cores and senesced litter from three dominant PFTs; litter collected per PFT (bryophytes, graminoids, shrubs) and shed Calluna leaves.
  - Experimental design: fully factorial with three temperatures (12, 14, 16°C), three PFTs (peat) and eight litter bag treatments (no litter, single-species litter, and mixtures in equal proportions); 288 cores total, 4 replicates per combination.
  - Litter decomposition measurement: litter bags incubated for 363 days; mass remaining (%) determined after oven-drying; moisture maintained via deionised water additions.
  - CO2 measurements: six respiration measurements (days 0, 56, 119, 174, 230, 363) using an infrared gas analyser with an airtight chamber.
  - Initial characterization: biochemical composition of peat and litter for each PFT (Total C, Total N, C:N), plus microbial community composition via PLFA as in Study 1.

- Methods and instrumentation
  - Gas analysis: CO2 and CH4 concentrations measured with Perkins Elmer AutosystemXL GC (FID with methaniser) and calibrated with certified standards.
  - Litter and peat chemistry: Total C and N via LECO Truspec CN Analyser; pH via ratioed peat suspensions using a pH meter; dry bulk density (BD) measurements for carbon and nitrogen stock calculations.
  - Microbial biomarkers: PLFA extraction and quantification using Bligh and Dyer method with GC analysis; identification of marker fatty acids for bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative) and fungi; overall PLFA concentration and ratios (e.g., F:B).
  - Moisture and mass: field moisture maintenance; litter moisture assessment via oven-drying to determine moisture content and dry weight basis.

- Data relationships and intended use
  - Primary outcomes: how temperature, water table, and PFT legacy jointly influence GHG fluxes (CO2, CH4) from peat, as well as decomposition rates and respiration in litter.
  - Linkages to microbiology: PLFA-derived microbial community structure linked to gas flux patterns and decomposition dynamics.
  - Data utility for models: supports development of predictive models for peatland carbon cycling under climate warming scenarios and microclimate effects (e.g., wind-farm–related microclimates), with explicit experimental controls and detailed metadata for cross-study integration.

- Context and rationale
  - Temperature manipulations reflect conditions exceeding mean annual temperature, and are framed against field-site microclimate variations observed near wind farms and projections of future climate (e.g., IPCC scenarios).
  - Experimental design aims to capture both abiotic changes (temperature, water table) and biotic legacies (PFTs) to approximate real-world drivers of peat carbon dynamics.

- Data scope and timeline
  - Study 1: 322-day incubation with six flux measurement points.
  - Study 2: 363-day incubation with six CO2 measurements and litter mass loss assessments.
  - Site-specific materials: peat and litter from Black Law Wind Farm; sampling area designed to minimize spatial heterogeneity.

- Notes for analysts
  - Data are configured to enable analysis of interaction effects between temperature, water table, and plant functional type on GHG fluxes and decomposition.
  - The dataset includes rich ancillary data (peat/litter chemistry, bulk density, pH, PLFAs) to support mechanistic interpretation of gas flux results.
  - Documentation details (sampling procedures, calibration references, and standard methods) support reproducibility and meta-analysis with related peatland datasets.
