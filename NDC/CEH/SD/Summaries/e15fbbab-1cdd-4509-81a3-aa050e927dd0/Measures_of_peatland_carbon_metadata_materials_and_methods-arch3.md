# Data description, Measures of peatland carbon cycling from peat mesocosm incubation experiments

## Purpose and context
- Describes data from two laboratory-based studies on how abiotic (temperature, water table) and biotic (plant functional type legacy) factors interact to control peatland carbon cycling.
- Location: blanket bog peatlands at Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland.
- Aims to understand drivers of greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and CH4) and litter/decomposition processes, with supporting biochemical and microbial data.

## Data collected and measures
- Gas flux measurements:
  - CO2 and CH4 fluxes from peat mesocosms; six flux measurements over 322 days in the first study.
  - CO2 fluxes (and respiration rates) measured at six time points in the second study (0, 56, 119, 174, 230, 363 days).
- Decomposition data:
  - Litter mass remaining (% of initial litter mass) in the second study.
- Biochemical and physical properties (peat and litter):
  - Total carbon (C) content, total nitrogen (N) content, C:N ratio, C stock, N stock.
  - Bulk density (peat), pH, and related soil properties.
  - Microbial community biomarkers via phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs): total PLFA, fungal PLFAs, total bacterial PLFAs, Gram-positive PLFAs, Gram-negative PLFAs, and ratios (Fungal:bacterial; Gram-positive:Gram-negative).
- Materials analyzed:
  - Peat and litter from Black Law wind farm sites; supplementary peat samples for detailed soil properties and microbial indicators.
- Initial biochemical characterisation:
  - For both studies, C and N contents, C:N ratios, and microbial community composition measured at the outset for peat and litter.

## Experimental design
- First laboratory study:
  - Fully factorial design: 3 temperatures (12, 14, 16°C), 3 water table levels (low ~25 cm, intermediate ~15 cm, high ~5 cm), 3 plant functional types (PFTs: Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum capillifolium).
  - Replication: 4 per treatment combination; total 108 intact peat cores.
  - Duration: 322 days; gas fluxes measured at 7, 35, 154, 223, and 322 days.
  - Setup: cores collected May 2011, manipulated water table with deionised water, incubated in controlled rooms.
- Second laboratory study:
  - Fully factorial design: 3 temperatures (12, 14, 16°C), 3 peat PFTs, 8 litter bag treatments (litter from single PFTs and mixtures).
  - Replication: 4 per combination; total 288 intact peat cores.
  - Duration: 363 days; litter decomposition assessed via mass loss; CO2 emissions measured at 0, 56, 119, 174, 230, 363 days.
  - Litter bag treatments included: no litter, single-PFT litter, and mixed litter in equal proportions.
- Sample collection:
  - Peat cores extracted from under three dominant PFTs (Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum spp.); litter collected for the second study.

## Methods and instruments
- Gas flux measurements:
  - Opaque chambers fitted to cores; gas samples collected with syringes and analyzed by Perkins Elmer AutosystemXL GC with FID and methaniser.
  - CO2 and CH4 standards used for calibration.
  - Flux calculations incorporate changes in chamber concentration, air temperature, chamber volume, and area.
- Litter and soil analysis:
  - Litter bags prepared with 0.50 g of air-dried litter; contained in 1 mm mesh to balance decomposition access and containment.
  - Litter mass loss calculated as a percentage of initial oven-dried mass.
  - Respiration rates measured with an EGM-4 portable IR gas analyser; calculations use chamber volume, temperature, and molar mass of CO2.
- Biochemical and microbial analyses:
  - Total C and N via LECO Truspec CN Analyser.
  - pH measured in peat-water suspensions.
  - Bulk density determined using standard soil methods.
  - PLFA analysis to characterize microbial community:
    - Extraction (Bligh and Dyer method) from 0.5 g peat; GC analysis with flame ionisation detector.
    - PLFAs identified and assigned to bacterial and fungal groups; calculations for total PLFA and group-specific markers.
    - Ratios: fungal:bacterial (F:B) and Gram-positive:Gram-negative (G+ vs G−) as relative abundance indicators.

## Data processing and outputs
- Flux calculations:
  - Derived from headspace concentration changes over time, corrected for temperature, chamber volume, and area, with calibration against certified gas standards.
- Decomposition and respiration:
  - Litter remaining expressed as percent of initial dry mass.
  - Respiration fluxes derived from CO2 accumulation in chambers over time.
- Initial and comparative biomarker data:
  - Peat and litter C and N contents, C:N ratios, and microbial community structure (PLFA profiles) used to interpret how substrate quality and microbial community relate to GHG fluxes and decomposition.
- Data integrity and comparability:
  - Fully documented experimental protocols, replication, and standardised instruments/methods to enable cross-study comparisons and integration into environmental health monitoring frameworks.

## Data quality, governance and accessibility considerations
- Calibration and quality control:
  - Gas flux measurements calibrated with certified standards; QA guided by established methods (e.g., standard soil methods, IPCC-referenced approaches).
  PLFA analyses double-checked with GC-MS identification and internal standards to ensure reliability.
- Metadata and data sharing:
  - Metadata are comprehensive (sampling, treatments, timings, and analytical methods), but publicly sharing underlying datasets can pose barriers; clear data governance and open data practices are essential for monitoring frameworks.
- Data transformations and format considerations:
  - Flux calculations require careful handling of chamber geometry, temperature, and time; data formats should preserve measurement timestamps and treatment labels to enable re-use in policy-relevant monitoring.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Key environmental health indicators provided:
  - Peatland GHG dynamics (CO2, CH4) in response to climate-relevant drivers (temperature, water table) and plant functional type legacies.
  - Decomposition rates and litter turnover under varying abiotic and biotic conditions.
  - Microbial community structure (PLFAs) and its relation to carbon cycling processes (F:B, G+ vs G− ratios).
- Potential policy and decision-useful applications:
  - Inform climate, land-use, and peatland management policies by linking microbially mediated carbon fluxes to environmental drivers.
  - Support development of monitoring frameworks that require standardized, transparent measures of peatland carbon balance and microbial indicators.
  - Provide baseline and comparative data for interpreting field observations and for validating process-based models of peatland carbon dynamics.

## Limitations and caveats
- Lab-based mesocosm context may not fully capture complex field conditions; extrapolation to in-situ peatland responses should be done cautiously.
- Temporal scales and controlled conditions may differ from natural variability; long-term field validation enhances policy relevance.
