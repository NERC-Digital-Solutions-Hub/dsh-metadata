# Data description, Measures of peatland carbon cycling from peat mesocosm incubation experiments.

- Two laboratory-based studies from Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland, exploring abiotic and biotic controls on peatland carbon cycling.
- Study 1 investigates interactive effects of small-scale temperature change, water table level, and plant functional type (PFT) legacy effects on CO2 and CH4 fluxes.
- Study 2 investigates interactive effects of small-scale temperature change and PFT legacy effects on peat and litter decomposition, plus associated CO2 fluxes.
- Data timeframe and collection:
  - Study 1: CO2 and CH4 fluxes measured six times across 322 days (primarily Oct 2011–Sept 2012).
  - Supplementary measurements on peat properties collected from the same sites.
  - Study 2: Litter decomposition and respiration measured over 363 days (core collection Oct 2012; incubation through 363 days).
- Site and materials:
  - Blanket bog peat from peat cores collected at Black Law Wind Farm, Scotland.
  - PFTs represented: Calluna vulgaris (shrubs), Eriophorum vaginatum (graminoids), Sphagnum spp. (bryophytes).
  - Peat and litter used in both studies analysed for biochemical and physical properties.

- Datasets included
  - Main flux dataset: CO2 and CH4 fluxes for Study 1 across temperatures, water table levels, and PFTs (six measurement points).
  - Supplementary peat properties dataset: peat bulk density, pH, total C, total N, C:N, C stock, N stock, and microbial PLFA data (total PLFAs; fungal and bacterial PLFAs; F:B ratio; gram-positive:gram-negative PLFA ratio) by PFT.
  - Study 2 dataset: litter decomposition as percent mass remaining; CO2 respiration rates during incubation; initial biochemical composition (C, N, C:N) for peat and litter by PFT; microbial community composition via PLFAs.
  - All data linked to field site, plant functional types, and corresponding treatments.

- Study 1: Experimental design and data
  - Fully factorial design: three temperatures (12, 14, 16°C), three water table levels (low 25 cm, intermediate 15 cm, high 5 cm), and three PFTs; replicated across cores.
  - Cores: 108 total cores; 36 cores per temperature room; 12 cores per PFT per temperature, assigned to water table treatments.
  - Incubation duration: 322 days.
  - Gas measurement method: opaque chambers attached to cores; headspace gas sampled and analyzed with Perkins Elmer AutosystemXL GC with FID and methaniser for CO2 and CH4 concentrations.
  - Flux calculations: derived from changes in chamber gas concentration, headspace temperature, and chamber volume/area.
  - Supplementary measurements on a subset of peat under each PFT for structural and chemical properties (bulk density, pH, C and N contents, C:N, C/N, C stock, N stock) and microbial biomarkers (PLFAs).

- Study 1: Measurements and instrumentation
  - CO2 and CH4 concentrations measured in headspace samples; calibration with certified gas standards.
  - Instruments:
    - GC with FID and methaniser (for CO2 and CH4).
    - LECO Truspec CN Analyser for total C and N.
    - Hanna 211 pH meter for peat pH.
    - Agilent 6890N GC EGM-4 portable IR gas analyser (in some components of the study).
  - PLFA analysis for microbial community composition:
    - Extraction using Bligh and Dyer-based method.
    - Quantification by GC with FLD; identification against MS data.
    - Fungal and bacterial PLFA markers used to derive community composition and ratios (e.g., F:B, gram-positive:gram-negative).

- Study 1: Supplementary peat properties
  - Measurements include bulk density, pH, total C and N, C:N, C stock, N stock, and PLFA-based microbial community data (including total PLFAs and groups: Gram+ bacteria, Gram- bacteria, saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi).

- Study 2: Experimental design and data
  - Fully factorial design: three temperatures (12, 14, 16°C), three peat PFTs, and eight litter bag treatments.
  - Cores: 288 total; 96 cores per PFT.
  - Litter types and treatments:
    - No litter (control).
    - Litter from one PFT (three single-species treatments).
    - Mixture of all three PFTs (equal proportions by weight).
  - Litter bag preparation: 0.50 g air-dried litter per bag; mesh 1 mm to allow decomposer access.
  - Incubation duration: 363 days; field moisture maintained gravimetrically; deionised water added to sustain moisture.
  - Litter decomposition measurement: final mass remaining as a percentage of initial dry mass.
  - CO2 measurements: six time points (0, 56, 119, 174, 230, 363 days) using IRGA with standard enclosure method; flux calculated from concentration change and chamber parameters.
  - Initial biochemical composition: C and N contents and C:N for five peat samples per PFT and four litter samples per PFT and PFT mixture, using the same analytical methods as Study 1.

- Data formats and metadata
  - Detailed documentation of experimental design, sampling scheme, and analytical methods included, enabling interpretation, replication, and re-use.
  - Variables cover gas fluxes (CO2, CH4), litter mass remaining, moisture controls, bulk density, pH, C and N contents, C:N ratios, C and N stocks, and PLFA-based microbial community metrics (including bacterial and fungal groups and their ratios).

- Potential data reuse and governance
  - Suitable for analyses of peatland carbon cycling responses to small-scale temperature and water table changes, and the role of plant functional type legacy in decomposition processes.
  - Supports modeling of greenhouse gas flux dynamics in peatlands under climate and land-use change scenarios.
  - Requires attention to site specificity (Black Law Wind Farm) and experimental conditions (mesocosm setup, controlled temperatures, moisture regimes) when generalizing to other peatlands.
  - Data management considerations for Data Leaders: ensure clear metadata, data provenance, unit consistency, and documentation of measurement methods; assess data discoverability, access, and updates; consider alignment with broader peatland data standards and community practices.
