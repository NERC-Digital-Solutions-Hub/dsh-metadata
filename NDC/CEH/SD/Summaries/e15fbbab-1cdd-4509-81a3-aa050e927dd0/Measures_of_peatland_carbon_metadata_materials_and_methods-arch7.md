# Measures of peatland carbon cycling from peat mesocosm incubation experiments

- Two laboratory-based studies conducted at Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland, investigating abiotic and biotic controls on peatland carbon cycling.
- Data types cover greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and CH4) and decomposition metrics, integrated with biochemical and physical properties of peat and litter.
- Aimed at understanding how plant functional types (PFTs) and small-scale climate changes (temperature and water table) affect peat carbon dynamics.

## Datasets and Content

- First laboratory study
  - CO2 and CH4 fluxes from peat mesocosms measured across six time points during 322 days of incubation.
  - Cores collected from beneath three dominant PFTs: Calluna vulgaris (shrub), Eriophorum vaginatum (graminoid), Sphagnum capillifolium (bryophyte).
  - Fully factorial design: 3 temperatures, 3 water table levels, 3 PFTs; 108 cores total (36 per temperature), with 12 cores per PFT per temperature.
  - Supplementary peat samples for biochemical and physical properties: bulk density, pH, total C and N, C:N, C and N stocks, PLFA-based microbial composition (bacteria and fungi), and fungal:bacterial ratios.
- Second laboratory study
  - Litter decomposition measured via litter bags on peat mesocosms, plus CO2 respiration data.
  - 288 intact cores across three temperatures and three PFTs; eight litter bag treatments (no litter, single-species litter from each PFT, and mixed litter).
  - Incubation lasted 363 days; litter mass remaining (% of initial dry mass) and CO2 fluxes measured (six time points: 0, 56, 119, 174, 230, 363 days).
  - Initial biochemical composition data for peat and litter: total C, total N, and C:N ratios for each PFT peat and litter; same methods used as in Study 1 for microbial community data.

## Experimental Design

- Study 1
  - Fully factorial: temperature (12, 14, 16°C), water table levels (low 25 cm, intermediate 15 cm, high 5 cm), plant functional types (three PFTs).
  - Peat cores: PVC tubes, 11 cm diameter, 30 cm depth; 36 cores per temperature, with replication across PFTs and water table treatments.
  - Incubation environment controlled to simulate field microclimate deviations from an 8°C mean annual temperature reference.
- Study 2
  - Fully factorial: temperature (12, 14, 16°C), 3 PFTs, eight litter bag treatments.
  - Peat cores: PVC tubes, 5 cm diameter, 15 cm depth; litter bags arranged to test single-species and mixed litter effects.
  - Litter bags designed to allow access to decomposers while minimizing loss (1 mm mesh; 0.50 g per bag).

## Measurements and Instruments

- Gas flux measurements
  - CO2 and CH4 fluxes obtained using standard chamber methods with gas sampling and GC analysis (PerkinElmer Autosystem XL with FID and methaniser for Study 1; IRGA for respiration measurements in Study 2).
  - Calibration against certified gas standards; flux calculations based on changes in concentration, temperature, chamber volume, and area.
- Biochemical and physical properties
  - Peat: bulk density, pH, total carbon, total nitrogen, C:N, C stock, N stock; PLFA-based microbial community composition (bacteria vs fungi) and ratios (F:B; gram-positive vs gram-negative bacteria).
  - Litter and peat initial composition: total C, total N, and C:N ratios.
- Microbial community assessment
  - Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) extraction and quantification following Bligh-Dyer methods; GC analysis with internal standards; microbial groups inferred from characteristic PLFAs.
  - Biomarker interpretation includes indicators for gram-positive/gram-negative bacteria and for saprotrophic/ectomycorrhizal fungi.

## Biochemical and Microbial Data

- Detailed PLFA profiles used to infer microbial community structure and shifts under different PFTs and climate treatments.
- Ratios (Fungal:bacterial PLFAs; gram-positive:gram-negative PLFAs) serve as relative abundance metrics.
- Supplementary measurements provide context for understanding GHG flux and decomposition responses via substrate quality and nutrient status.

## Data Processing, Quality and References

- Gas measurement protocols and calibration procedures follow established references (e.g., Holland et al., 1999; case-specific calibration against standards).
- PLFA identification and quantification rely on established biomarkers and comparative retention times with internal standards (e.g., Frostegård et al., 1991; Frostegård, 1993).
- Supplementary methods for peat chemistry and density integrate standard soil science procedures (e.g., LECO CN analysis, pH measurements, BD calculations).

## GIS and Mapping Implications

- Geographic context: study site located at Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland; precise spatial coordinates not provided in the summary, but location enables regional peatland carbon-cycle mapping.
- Potential GIS uses for GIS specialists
  - Integrate experimental treatments with environmental layers (microclimate proxies, PFT distributions, peat properties) to model how microhabitat variation influences GHG flux and decomposition.
  - Link laboratory-derived response functions (to temperature, water table, and PFTs) with field-derived peatland maps to extrapolate potential carbon balance scenarios.
  - Create geospatial datasets of peat biochemical characteristics (C, N, C:N, PLFA markers) by PFT and microclimate treatment to support landscape-scale carbon cycling analyses.
- Note: The data are from controlled mesocosm experiments, so spatial patterns reflect experimental design rather than broad field gradients; appropriate for linking with site-level GIS layers for hypothesis testing and scenario analysis.
