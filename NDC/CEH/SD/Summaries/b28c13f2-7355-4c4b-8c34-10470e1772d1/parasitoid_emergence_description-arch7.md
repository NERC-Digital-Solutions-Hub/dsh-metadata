# Description, Experimental Design and Collection

## Overview
- Data represent the abundance of parasitic wasps (Diaretiella rapae) that emerged from cabbage aphids collected via sticky traps on Brassica napus plants within FADOE rings.
- Only the parasitoid species found in abundance during the study.

## Spatial and temporal coverage
- Years: 2018 and 2019 (two-year study).
- Primary location: field of wheat where FADOE rings were deployed.
- Ring locations and movement:
  - 2018: rings located in a field of wheat at latitude 51.482853, longitude -0.897749.
  - 2019: rings moved to an adjacent field at latitude 51.482374, longitude -0.895855.
- Ring-level treatment layout: two rings per each of four pollution treatments.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Pollution treatments: diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O3), diesel exhaust + ozone (D+O3), control (CON).
- OPEN treatment protocol: five-week-old plants inoculated with 10 Brevicoryne brassica aphids; nets placed to allow parasitoid activity, then removed for one week; nets reinstalled with sticky traps inside to catch emerging parasitoids.
- Replication across plants: 4, 7, and 4 Plant_IDs in Run 1, Run 2, and Run 3, respectively.
- Runs: three experimental runs conducted over the two years.

## Data collected and structure
- Primary variable: Parasitoids_emerged (count of parasitoids captured), focused on Diaretiella rapae as the abundant parasitoid species.
- Key attributes (columns): Year, Ring, Pollutant, Treatment, Plant_ID, Run, Parasitoids_emerged.

## Data collection procedures
- Sticky traps collected 10 days after nets were placed inside the OPEN plants.
- Parasitoids identified and counted from collected traps.
