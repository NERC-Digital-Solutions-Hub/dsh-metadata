# Description, Experimental Design and Collection

## Overview
- Data on the abundance of parasitic wasps (Diaretiella rapae) emerging from cabbage aphids (Brevicoryne brassicae) collected from sticky traps on Brassica napus plants.
- Conducted within Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings over two years (2018–2019).
- Plants exposed to four pollution treatments: diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O3), diesel exhaust plus ozone (D+O3), and control (CON).
- Aim aligns with environmental health monitoring by linking pollutant exposure to ecological interactions influencing ecosystem services.

## Experimental Design
- FADOE rings were distributed within a field of wheat in 2018 (coordinates: 51.482853, -0.897749) and moved to an adjacent field in 2019 (51.482374, -0.895855).
- Each ring was assigned to one of four pollutant treatments (D, O3, D+O3, CON) with a parallel OPEN treatment where plants were inoculated with aphids.
- OPEN treatment procedure:
  - Plants five weeks old were inoculated with 10 Brevicoryne brassicae aphids and netted.
  - Nets were removed for one week to allow natural parasitoid activity, then re-nailed with a sticky trap inside the net to catch emerging parasitoids.
- Replication:
  - Plants per run: 4 (first run), 7 (second run), and 4 (third run).
  - The experiment was repeated across three runs over the two-year period.

## Data Collected
- Primary response: number of Diaretiella rapae parasitoids emerged ( Parasitoids_emerged ).
- Metadata fields:
  - Year (experimental year)
  - Ring (ring identifier)
  - Pollutant (D, O3, D+O3, CON)
  - Treatment (OPEN vs other experimental manipulations)
  - Plant_ID (individual plant identifier)
  - Run (experimental run number)
- Collection timing: sticky traps within nets for OPEN plants were collected 10 days after placement, and parasitoids were identified and counted.

## Methods, Quality and Metadata
- Full FADOE configuration and quality control details are described in the referenced methodology.
- Only one parasitoid species, Diaretiella rapae, was found in abundance in this dataset.
- The data are structured to facilitate comparisons across pollutant treatments, replicates, and runs, supporting evaluation of how atmospheric pollutants may influence insect–aphid–parasitoid dynamics.

- The dataset contributes to understanding environmental health impacts on insect-mediated interactions and downstream ecosystem services under air pollution exposure.
