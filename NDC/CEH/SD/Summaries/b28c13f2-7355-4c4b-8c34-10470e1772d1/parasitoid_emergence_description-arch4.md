# Description, Experimental Design and Collection

## Overview
- Objective: quantify the abundance of parasitic wasps (Diaretiella rapae) emerging from cabbage aphids (Brevicoryne brassicae) collected from sticky traps on Brassica napus plants within Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings under different air pollutant treatments.
- Timeframe: sampling conducted over two years (two experimental fields/years).
- Experimental units: FADOE rings assigned numbers; field location changed between 2018 and 2019.
- Treatments:
  - Pollutants: diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O3), diesel exhaust plus ozone (D+O3), and control (CON).
  - OPEN treatment protocol used to expose aphids to parasitoids via nets and internal sticky traps to capture emerging parasitoids.
- Replication: four, seven, and four plants in the first, second, and third experimental runs respectively; the experiment was repeated three times over the two years.
- Outcome: count of Diaretiella rapae parasitoids emerged, identified as the predominant parasitoid species in abundance.

## Experimental Design
- Field and timing:
  - Rings distributed within a wheat field in 2018; rings moved to an adjacent field in 2019.
  - Specific GPS coordinates provided for each year.
- Treatments:
  - Four pollutant treatments (D, O3, D+O3, CON) assigned to rings.
- OPEN treatment protocol:
  - Plants inoculated with 10 Brevicoryne brassica aphids when 5 weeks old.
  - Nets placed around plants; after two weeks nets removed for one week to allow parasitoid activity; nets re-applied with sticky traps inside to catch emerging parasitoids.
- Replication and runs:
  - Run 1: 4 plants per ring
  - Run 2: 7 plants per ring
  - Run 3: 4 plants per ring
  - Three experimental repeats over two years.

## Data Collected and Structure
- Primary variables (columns):
  - Year
  - Ring
  - Pollutant
  - Treatment
  - Plant_ID
  - Run
  - Parasitoids_emerged (count of Diaretiella rapae)
- Data collection method:
  - Sticky traps collected inside nets of OPEN plants 10 days after net placement.
  - Parasitoids identified and counted; Diaretiella rapae was the dominant species observed.

## Provenance, Metadata and Quality Control
- Full methodological details and quality control measures are described in the FADOE configuration methodology reference.
- Reference for methodology: Ryalls, J.M.W. et al. 2022, Environmental Pollution, includes the documentation of QA/QC procedures for the FADOE setup.
- Data governance considerations:
  - Metadata should capture field location, year, ring, pollutant, treatment, run, and collection timing to ensure replicability and cross-study comparability.
  - Data content and format should be verified against the referenced methodology to ensure consistency.

## Data Governance, Reuse and Implications for Data Leaders
- Reuse potential: evaluating how air pollutants (diesel and ozone) influence aphid-parasitoid dynamics; cross-site or cross-study comparisons possible with standardized metadata.
- Governance notes:
  - Maintain clear linkage between experimental design (pollutant treatment, OPEN protocol) and observed parasitoid counts.
  - Ensure traceability to the sampling timeline and field coordinates for reproducibility and integration with environmental data sources.
