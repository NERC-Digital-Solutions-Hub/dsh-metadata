# Aphid_population_plant_mass.csv

## Aim
- Document plant and aphid masses from Brassica napus under Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings to monitor environmental health impacts of pollutants on insect-plant interactions.
- Provide data in a consistent format to enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Experimental Design and Collection
- Two-year sampling (Year column A) with multiple experimental runs.
- FADOE rings assigned Ring numbers (column B) and deployed in 2018 in a field of wheat (coordinates provided); relocated to a neighboring field in 2019.
- Four pollution treatments (Pollutant: D, O3, D+O3, CON) across rings.
- Aphid inoculation treatments (Treatment: 50, 10, or 0 aphids) applied when plants were five weeks old.
- Replicates per run: Run 1 had 4 plants, Run 2 had 7, Run 3 had 4 (four, seven, and four replicate plants, respectively).
- After eight weeks, aphids were collected using a pooter and weighed; plants were oven dried and weighed.

## Measured and Derived Variables
- Aphid_population_mass_g: aphid mass per plant (grams).
- Plant_mass_g: dry mass of the plant (grams).
- Aphid_population_mass_mg_per_g_plant_mass: aphid mass relative to plant mass (milligrams per gram of plant mass), the key derived variable.

## Data Processing and Quality Assurance
- Data collection methodology and quality control are described for the FADOE setup (full details in Ryalls et al. 2022).
- Data were verified, cleaned, and transformed using standardised methods.
- Outputs are prepared for clear presentation (e.g., alongside metadata like Year, Ring, Pollutant, Treatment, Plant_ID, Run).

## Data Storage, Access, and Reuse
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
- Designed to enable access to underlying data to support reuse and integration with other monitoring datasets and analyses.
