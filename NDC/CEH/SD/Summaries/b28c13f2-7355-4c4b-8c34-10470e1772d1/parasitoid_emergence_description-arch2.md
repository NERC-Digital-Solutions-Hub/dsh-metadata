# Description, Experimental Design and Collection

- Study objective: quantify abundance of parasitic wasps (Diaretiella rapae) that emerged from cabbage aphids on Brassica napus plants within Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings, to support monitoring of environmental health under air pollutant treatments.
- Data scope: two-year sampling (2018–2019) across multiple FADOE rings and pollution treatments, recording the number of parasitoids emerged from aphids collected on individual plants.
- Location and setup:
  - Field location in 2018: field of wheat at latitude 51.482853, longitude -0.897749.
  - Field location in 2019: moved to adjacent field at latitude 51.482374, longitude -0.895855.
  - FADOE rings: numbered rings distributed within the field; two rings per pollution treatment.
  - Pollution treatments: diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O3), diesel exhaust + ozone (D+O3), and control (CON; natural air).
- Experimental design:
  - OPEN treatment: plants five weeks old, inoculated with 10 Brevicoryne brassica aphids and netted.
  - Post-inoculation: nets removed for one week to allow parasitoid activity, then nets re-applied and a sticky trap placed inside the net for parasitoid capture.
  - Replication: Year 1 had four plants per run, Year 2 had seven plants per run, Year 3 had four plants per run.
  - Runs: three experimental runs across the two years.
- Data collection and measurement:
  - For each plant, sticky traps inside nets were collected 10 days after trap placement.
  - Outcome variable: number of Diaretiella rapae parasitoids emerged (the dominant parasitoid species for B. brassicae in this setup; others were not abundantly observed).
  - Primary data column: Parasitoids_emerged (count) per Plant_ID, within Run, Ring, Pollutant, and Treatment.

- Data quality and reuse considerations:
  - Data are gathered using standardized procedures across treatments and years to enable comparisons of environmental health indicators.
  - Original dataset emphasizes verifying and quality-assuring data from established monitoring protocols; outputs are suitable for reporting in maps, charts, and standardised environmental health formats.
  - Suggested practices include storing datasets in appropriate data portals and, where possible, combining with other relevant environmental datasets to increase value and accessibility.
