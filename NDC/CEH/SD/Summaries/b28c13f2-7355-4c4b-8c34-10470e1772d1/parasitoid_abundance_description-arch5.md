# Description, Experimental Design and Collection

## Overview
- Describes the abundance of parasitoid wasps (Diaeretiella rapae and other parasitoids) collected from sticky traps placed around Brassica napus plants within Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings.
- Sampling occurs over two years, with data organized by Year, Ring, Pollutant, Treatment, and Run.
- Parasitoids were identified and counted from traps collected in weeks 7 and 8, then pooled per Treatment, Ring, and Year.
- A derived metric, Percentage_D_rapae, represents the proportion of D. rapae among total parasitoids.
- Full FADOE configuration and quality control details are described in a referenced methodology.

## Experimental design and sampling
- Field setup: two Brassica napus plant groups in FADOE rings located in a field of wheat; rings moved from one field in 2018 to an adjacent field in 2019 (field coordinates provided).
- Ring designation: each FADOE ring assigned a number (Ring).
- Pollution treatments (Pollutant): four levels— diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O3), diesel exhaust plus ozone (D+O3), and control (CON; natural air).
- Aphid treatments (Treatment): plants inoculated with 50 aphids, 10 aphids, or no aphids.
- Sampling schedule: one sticky trap placed on a stick around plant groups in Run 1 (4 plants), Run 2 (7 plants), and Run 3 (4 plants); repeats across three runs over two years.
- Trap turnover: traps collected at seven weeks, replaced with new traps; second set collected one week later; traps frozen at -20 °C for later identification.
- Identification: parasitoids identified under a microscope and classified as Diaeretiella rapae or Other.
- Replication: data collected per trap per Ring per Year, then pooled by Treatment per Ring per Year.

## Data collected and processing
- Collected counts: D_rapae_counts (Diaeretiella rapae) and Others_counts (other parasitoids) per trap.
- Derived metric: Percentage_D_rapae calculated as the share of D. rapae among total parasitoids.
- Data aggregation: counts from weeks 7 and 8 pooled for each Treatment, Ring, and Year.
- Data processing steps: identification, counting, pooling across collection weeks, and calculation of percentage; all methodology aligned with the referenced FADOE configuration.

## Quality, provenance and governance
- Raw data include counts by Ring, Year, Pollutant, Treatment, Run, along with derived Percentage_D_rapae.
- Methodology and quality control for the FADOE setup are described in the cited reference (Ryalls et al. 2022).
- Data are structured to support reproducibility, traceability, and potential reuse across studies examining pollutant effects on parasitoid abundance.

## Relevance for data stewardship
- Clear metadata structure (Year, Ring, Pollutant, Treatment, Run, counts, and percentage) supports discoverability and interoperability.
- Documented collection and processing steps facilitate auditability and potential updates or corrections.
- Referenced methodology provides a basis for quality assurance and standardization across datasets.
