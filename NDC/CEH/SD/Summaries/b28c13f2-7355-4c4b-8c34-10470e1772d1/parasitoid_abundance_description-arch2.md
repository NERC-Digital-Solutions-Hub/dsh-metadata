# Description, Experimental Design and Collection

- Purpose and scope
  - Data represent the abundance of parasitoid wasps (Diaeretiella rapae and others) collected from sticky traps in Brassica napus within Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings.
  - Aimed at understanding how environmental pollutants and aphid infestation levels influence parasitoid communities.

- Experimental design
  - Location and timeframe: field experiments in 2018–2019; two fields (wheat field in 2018, moved to adjacent field in 2019) with precise coordinates provided.
  - Pollution treatments: four treatments—diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O3), diesel exhaust + ozone (D+O3), and control (CON); two rings per treatment (8 rings total).
  - Aphid treatments: plants inoculated with 50 aphids, 10 aphids, or no aphids.
  - Experimental runs: three runs across the two years; trap placement varied by run (first run: groups of four plants, second run: seven plants, third run: four plants).
  - Trapping schedule: sticky traps deployed at seven weeks old plants; traps replaced and frozen (-20 °C); a second trap set collected one week later and frozen (-20 °C).

- Measurements and data processing
  - Identification and counting: parasitoids identified under a microscope and categorized as Diaeretiella rapae (D_rapae_counts) or Others (Others_counts).
  - Data aggregation: counts pooled across weeks 7 and 8 for each Treatment, Ring, and Year.
  - Derived metric: Percentage of D. rapae (Percentage_D_rapae) calculated from total parasitoids.

- Data handling and reference
  - Methodology and quality control for FADOE described in the referenced work: Ryalls et al. 2022 (Environmental Pollution).
  - Data management: datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals; outputs formatted as reports, maps, and charts.

- Relevance to environmental monitoring
  - Provides standardized, trackable data on parasitoid abundance under varying pollutant exposures and aphid pressure, supporting evaluation of environmental health and pollination-related ecosystem services over time.

- Challenges and opportunities for this dataset
  - Increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant environmental data.
  - Enabling access to the underlying data used to produce final outputs for broader use and scrutiny.
