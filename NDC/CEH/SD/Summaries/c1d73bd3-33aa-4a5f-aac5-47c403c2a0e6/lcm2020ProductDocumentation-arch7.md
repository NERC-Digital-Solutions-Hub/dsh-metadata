# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020

- The LCM2020 is the eighth UK land cover map produced by UK CEH and introduces an annual, automated mapping workflow. It aims to support monitoring of state and change in the UK countryside and to facilitate decision-making for environmental objectives.
- Product scope: for GB and Northern Ireland, LCM2020 comprises six datasets total (three datasets per region): 
  - 10m Classified Pixel dataset
  - Land Parcel dataset (classified parcels)
  - 25m Pixel Rasterised Land Parcel dataset
- Classification is automated and uses Bootstrap Training with a Random Forest classifier, achieving an overall accuracy of about 79% at full thematic detail.

- Land cover classes: 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes linked to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats, with careful notes on relationships and distinctions between UKCEH classes and BAP Broad Habitats. The mapping preserves compatibility with earlier products while recognizing differences between remote sensing classifications and field-based BAP definitions.

- Validation: validated against GB countryside survey data (2019–2020), National Forest Inventory data, IACS data, and bespoke validation points (34715 points in total). Reported overall accuracy around 79.2% (Appendix 4).

- Datasets and structure (GB and Northern Ireland):
  - 10m Classified Pixel datasets: classified Classification Scenes; two-band output per region:
    - Band 1: UKCEH Land Cover Class (integer)
    - Band 2: class membership probability/confidence
    - Note: 10m pixels have not been generalised to the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine-scale features; intended for specialist users who understand the implications.
  - Land Parcel datasets: generated by intersecting the 10m Classified Pixel data with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework; parcels have a minimum area of ~0.5 ha (Minimum Mappable Unit, MMU) and are designed to reduce classification noise and support change detection.
    - Parcel attributes (example fields): ogc_fid, gid, history, mode, purity, conf, stdev, agg, n, etc.
    - Parcel counts: GB ~6.74 million parcels; NI ~0.90 million parcels.
  - 25m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets: rasterisation of parcels into 25m pixels, carrying three attributes (band 1: mode; band 2: conf; band 3: purity).
  - 10m Seasonal Composite Images and Context Rasters (discussed below) are used to create Classification Scenes for the pixel-level classification.

- Seasonal Composite Images and Context Rasters:
  - Seasonal Composite Images: derived from Google Earth Engine using Sentinel-2 surface reflectance, resampled to 10 m for band set; four seasons (winter, spring, summer, autumn) with nine bands (bands 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11,12). Null values used for gaps; classification tolerates partially complete spectral information.
  - Context Rasters (GB): 10 bands to resolve spectral confusion, including terrain (height, aspect, slope), proximity masks (distance to buildings, roads, sea, freshwater), foreshore mask, tidal mask, and woodland mask.
  - Context Rasters (NI): terrain (height, aspect, slope) plus urban mask, and distance-to-coast, distance-to-freshwater, distance-to-road layers.
  - These contextual layers are designed to reduce spectral confusion and improve land cover separation.

- Classification Scenes and processing approach:
  - GB: 100x100 km tiles; 36-band Seasonal Composite Images combined with 46-band Context Rasters to form GB Classification Scenes. 74 overlapping Classification Scenes classified independently; visual inspection resolved precedence when overlaps occurred (one manual step in GB workflow).
  - NI: A single 43-band Classification Scene per year created from a single 100x100 km tile (minimum bounding rectangle of NI land mass).
  - The UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework serves as the spatial framework for parcel-based outputs and was originally developed for LCM2007, with minor updates since LCM2015.

- Bootstrap Training and Random Forest:
  - Bootstrap Training uses historic LCMs (LCM2017–2019) to sample training observations automatically from land parcels with >99% purity across three years.
  - Training dataset sizes: GB ~941,027 observations; NI ~214,833 observations.
  - Random Forest classifier trained on balanced samples: 10,000 pixels per class (with replacement) to ensure equal representation of all 21 classes and mitigate dominance by common classes.
  - Software: bespoke LCM processing pipeline that combines WEKA (machine learning) with PostGIS and GDAL (open-source tools).

- Data quality, use and limitations:
  - The 10m Classified Pixel dataset is designed for high-detail mapping and may include narrow features that fall below the MMU; users should be aware that the associated validation was performed against the Land Parcel dataset, not the 10m pixels themselves.
  - Annual production emphasizes distinguishing real land cover change from random classification noise; random errors are expected to flicker across years.
  - Some regional complexities exist: NI uses a single Classification Scene; GB uses multiple overlapping scenes with manual precedence decisions for final cut.
  - The Land Parcel Spatial Framework identifiers (gid) do not match those used in LCM2015, affecting direct parcel-based comparisons across years for some users.
  - Validation points and accuracy: overall accuracy 79.2% at full thematic detail; confusion matrices and producer/user accuracy metrics are provided in Appendix 4.

- Practical guidance for GIS specialists:
  - For high-resolution map products and detailed feature capture, use the 10m Classified Pixel dataset (GB and NI) with caution: it preserves fine features but is not generalised to the parcel framework.
  - Use Land Parcel outputs for robust time-series analyses and change detection, benefitting from a fixed parcel framework with MMU ~0.5 ha; connect parcel attributes with 10m pixel classifications.
  - When performing comparative analyses with earlier LCMs (e.g., LCM2015), expect non-matching parcel identifiers due to framework changes; focus on spatial overlap and class agreement rather than direct id equivalence.
  - For regional analyses where spectral confusion is likely (e.g., arable vs improved grassland, various grassland classes, or coastal classes), leverage Context Rasters and Seasonal Composite information to improve classification reliability.
  - The Landsat- or Sentinel-based temporal signals (seasonal differences) can support change detection, with annual map series enabling flicker-free interpretation of persistent change.
  - Access and usage: the data are provided with official dataset names in Appendix 5; coordinate systems are region-specific (GB: EPSG 27700; NI: EPSG 29903).

- Appendix and documentation highlights:
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes with relationships to BAP Broad Habitats; notes on equivalences and differences; italicized BAP terms when referring to BAP Broad Habitats and capitalized terms for defined UKCEH classes.
  - Appendix 1–3 provide class definitions, interpretation notes, and recommended color schemes for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes.
  - Appendix 4 provides full correspondence matrices, accuracy assessments, and class-level producer/user accuracies.
  - Appendix 5 lists the full set of LCM2020 datasets and their national scope.

- Key takeaway for GIS workflow:
  - LCM2020 delivers detailed, annual, remotely-sensed land cover maps for GB and Northern Ireland, combining high-detail 10m pixel classifications with a parcel-based framework and 25m rasterised parcels. It emphasizes automated training, contextual information, and robust validation, offering powerful data products for map-based analysis, change detection, and policy-relevant decision support, with best use achieved by aligning data products to the parcel framework when possible and by leveraging the 10m pixel outputs for detailed, fine-scale study areas.
