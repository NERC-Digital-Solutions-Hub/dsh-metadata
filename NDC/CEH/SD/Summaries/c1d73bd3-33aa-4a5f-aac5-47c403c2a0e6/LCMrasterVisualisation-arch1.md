# Visualising UKCEH Land Cover Class using a GIS application

- Data structure: Land cover rasters for 2017–2020 are multiband. 20 m and 10 m datasets have two bands (Band 1 = UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier; Band 2 = classification confidence). 25 m datasets have three bands (Band 1 = dominant class; Bands 2–3 = confidence indicators).
- Purpose: A short guide to visualize the Land Cover Class data contained in Band 1 using common GIS applications; for full data description, refer to the product documentation.
- QGIS workflow:
  - Add the file to the project; layer appears in the layers panel.
  - Open Layer Properties > Symbology.
  - Render as Paletted/Unique Values using Band 1.
  - Load style from LCMcolours_QGIS.qml and apply; the map updates to display correct classification.
- ArcGIS Desktop workflow:
  - Navigate to the data folder and expand the raster to view bands.
  - Drag Band_1 into the Table of Contents.
  - Open layer properties > Symbology; choose Unique Values; if prompted, confirm value calculation.
  - Use Import to load LCMcolours.lyr; OK to redraw the map with correct classification.
- ArcGIS Pro workflow:
  - In the project, browse to the data folder and display raster bands.
  - Drag Band_1 into the Table of Contents.
  - Open layer properties > Symbology; select Unique Values.
  - If prompted to build an attribute table, confirm; use Import to load LCMcolours.lyr; map redraws with correct classification.
- Provided styling files:
  - LCMcolours_QGIS.qml for QGIS
  - LCMcolours.lyr for ArcGIS Desktop/Pro
- Note: The guidance focuses on visualising Band 1; the related confidence bands exist but are not used in these visualization steps.
