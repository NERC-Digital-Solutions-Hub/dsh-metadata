# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020

- Purpose and scope
  - User guide for the UKCEH Land Cover Map 2020 (LCM2020): six datasets for Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI), including 10 m classified pixel data, land parcels, and 25 m rasterised land parcels.
  - Aims to help users understand data production, validation, and accuracy to make informed decisions and support change detection and environmental objectives.
- Land cover basis and classes
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes, aligned with Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats (not identical to BAP).
  - Classes mapped from Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images plus 10 Context Rasters to reduce spectral confusion.
  - Annual production enables monitoring of state and change in the UK countryside.
- Data products and structure
  - Three geospatial dataset types (six datasets total):
    - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI): mosaic of classification scenes; band 1 = dominant UKCEH Land Cover Class; band 2 = class probability; not generalised by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine features.
    - Land Parcel datasets: generated by intersecting 10 m pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework; include parcel attributes.
    - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets: three-band rasters per parcel (mode, conf, purity).
  - Dataset details
    - GB: British National Grid (EPSG: 27700); NI: Irish Grid (EPSG: 29903).
    - Pixel resolution: 10 m (GB and NI); 25 m rasterised parcels; additional 8-bit raster products.
    - Parcel counts: GB ~6.7 million; NI ~0.9 million.
    - Classification Scenes: GB uses 100 x 100 km tiles (74 overlapping scenes); NI uses a single 36-band scene per year.
- Data inputs and methodology
  - Seasonal Composite Images: Sentinel-2 (four seasons: winter, spring, summer, autumn) with nine spectral bands; some gaps allowed.
  - Context Rasters: 10 m GB rasters (height, aspect, slope, distance to buildings/roads/sea/freshwater, foreshore, tidal water, woodland mask); NI includes urban mask and coast/freshwater distances.
  - Classification approach
    - Bootstrap Training: automatic generation of training data from historic LCMs (2017–2019) filtered to >99% purity; large training sets to balance classes.
    - Random Forest: classifier trained with 10,000 samples per class per bag; balanced learning to avoid dominance by common classes.
- Land Parcel Framework and MMU
  - UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework based on ~0.5 ha minimum mapping unit.
  - Parcels designed to reduce classification noise and enable change detection; identifiers (gid) may not align with LCM2015 when comparing datasets.
- Validation and accuracy
  - Validation using GB countryside survey (2019–2020), National Forest Inventory, IACS, and bespoke validation points (total ~34,715 points).
  - Overall accuracy: 79.2% at full thematic detail (Appendix 4 provides detailed confusion matrices and producer/user accuracies by class).
- Data usage notes and caveats
  - 10 m Classified Pixels are not generalised to the Land Parcel Spatial Framework; detailed features preserved for specialist use.
  - Validation and accuracy pertain to the Land Parcel dataset; pixel-level validation not directly equivalent to parcel-level accuracy.
  - UK BAP Broad Habitats mapping differences: relationships documented; readers should note terminology distinctions and italicisation when referring to BAP names.
  - Some spectral confusion is anticipated (e.g., between certain grasslands, peatland, upland vegetation; coastal Saltwater vs Freshwater near tidal zones).
- Display, metadata, and accessibility
  - Appendix 3 provides recommended color schemes for displaying each UKCEH Land Cover Class.
  - Appendix 5 lists official dataset names for all six datasets and their geographic extents.
- Practical implications and use cases
  - Suitable for national-scale monitoring, change detection, and environmental reporting; supports policy, planning, and environmental management with a harmonised, annually updated map.
  - Users should account for potential class confusion, the 0.5 ha MMU constraint, and the absence of extensive manual corrections in the latest release.
