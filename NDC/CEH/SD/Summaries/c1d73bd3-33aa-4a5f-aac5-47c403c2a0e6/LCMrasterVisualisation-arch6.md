# Visualising UKCEH Land Cover Class using a GIS application

- Purpose: Short guide to visualise UKCEH Land Cover Class data in common GIS tools, focusing on band 1 of the multiband rasters (2017–2020). Full data description is in the product documentation.
- Data structure:
  - 20m and 10m rasters: two bands
    - Band 1: UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier
    - Band 2: classification confidence
  - 25m rasters: three bands
    - Band 1: dominant UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier
    - Bands 2–3: classification confidence indicators
- Core guideline: Visualise using band 1 only (the class identifiers) with a preprepared color style file.
- Visualisation steps by GIS tool:
  - QGIS
    - Add the file to the project; select the layer, open Layer Properties -> Symbology -> Paletted/Unique Values -> Band 1
    - Load style from LCMcolours_QGIS.qml; apply to redraw map with correct classification
  - ArcGIS Desktop
    - In Catalog, locate data; drag band_1 to Table of Contents
    - Layer Properties -> Symbology -> Unique Values; import LCMcolours.lyr; OK to redraw map
  - ArcGIS Pro
    - Open Catalog, locate data; drag band_1 to Table of Contents
    - Layer Properties -> Contents -> Symbology (Appearance) -> Unique Values
    - Use the hamburger menu in the Symbology panel -> Import; load LCMcolours.lyr; map redraws with correct classification
- Practical notes:
  - Ensure you are visualising band 1 to reflect the Land Cover Class identifiers
  - Color styles are provided (LCMcolours_QGIS.qml or LCMcolours.lyr) to ensure consistent classification visuals
  - For ArcGIS Pro, if prompted to build an attribute table, select Yes
