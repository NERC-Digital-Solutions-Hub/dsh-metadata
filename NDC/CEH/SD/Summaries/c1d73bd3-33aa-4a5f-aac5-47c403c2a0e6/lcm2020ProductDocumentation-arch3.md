# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020

- A user guide describing LCM2020, the UKCEH land cover map for 2020, which comprises six geospatial datasets (three for GB and Northern Ireland) including 10m classified pixels, classified land parcels, and 25m rasterised land parcels. The guide explains data production, validation, and data accuracy to help users apply LCM2020 in current and future work.
  
## Purpose and overview
- LCM2020 is the eighth UK land cover map, building on previous versions (1990–2019).
- Uses classification Scenes created from Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images plus 10 Context Layers to reduce spectral confusion.
- Classification is automatic, based on Bootstrap Training and a Random Forest classifier.
- Aims to enable annual mapping for monitoring state, change, and policy evaluation; allows change detection as a central objective of the time-series.

## Data products and structure
- 10m Classified Pixel datasets: pixel-level land cover classification with two bands per pixel (class identifier and associated probability). Not generalised by the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine features; targeted at specialist users.
- Land Parcel datasets: generated by intersecting 10m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to produce parcel-level attributes.
- 25m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets: per-parcel land-cover rasters (three-band raster: dominant class, mean confidence, and purity).
- 20m Classified Raster Product (Northern Ireland): 10m pixel data rasterised to 20m for certain outputs.
- Seasonal Composite Images: four-season Sentinel-2 based mosaics (winter, spring, summer, autumn) used in classification.
- Context Rasters: 10m contextual layers (GB and NI) such as terrain (height, aspect, slope) and proximity masks (distance to buildings, roads, coast, freshwater, urban areas, etc.) to resolve spectral confusion.
- Classification Scenes: GB used 100x100 km tiles to assemble 36-band seasonal composites plus 10 context layers into 46-band scenes; Northern Ireland used a single 43-band scene.

## Data sources and processing approach
- Seasonal data: Sentinel-2 reflectance bands resampled to 10 m with seasonal medians; some cloud gaps were tolerated without manual gap filling.
- Context rasters: GB uses NEXTMap terrain products and multiple OS-derived proximity masks; NI uses NI open data for urban, coast, freshwater, and roads.
- Land parcel framework: based on a long-running UK framework designed to represent discrete real-world units (≥0.5 ha MMU), enabling comparability over time.
- Bootstrap Training: automatically samples training observations from historic, wall-to-wall maps (LCM2017–2019) to train the classifier, removing need for fresh field data.
- Random Forest classifier: balanced sampling (equal pixel observations per class) to prevent dominance by common classes; training uses 10,000 samples per class with replacement.
- Processing workflow: training observations sampled from Bootstrap Training parcels; classification scenes produced per tile; visual precedence used to resolve overlapping classifications.

## Classification methodology and validation
- Classifier and validation: Random Forest classifier trained with Bootstrap Training data; outputs the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class with associated confidence per pixel.
- Validation: conducted against GB countryside survey data (2019, 2020), open data from National Forest Inventory, IACS data, and bespoke validation points (34715 locations total).
- Overall accuracy: 79.2% at full thematic detail (Appendix 4).
- Validation results presented via confusion matrices and producer’s/user’s accuracy metrics for each class.

## UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats alignment
- LCM2020 uses 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes, which relate to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats but are not identical to BAP classifications.
- Appendices explain mapping nuances, including where BAP Broad Habitats are split or aggregated to align with satellite-detected classes (e.g., Urban vs Suburban; Heather vs Heather Grassland; Saltwater vs Freshwater).
- General guidance on interpreting classes and how contextual and spectral information inform classifications.

## Methodological notes and practical considerations
- Bootstrap Training draws from large historical datasets; relies on majority signal, enabling updates with short refresh intervals.
- The 10m Classified Pixels are not generalised, preserving fine landscape features but meaning validation is against the Land Parcel dataset, not the 10m pixel dataset.
- Annual production is intended to help distinguish real land-cover change from random classification noise (random errors flicker over time; real change persists).
- Acknowledges some limitations and potential misclassifications, with improved resolution and contextual data helping reduce spectral confusion.

## Data governance, openness, and usability considerations
- The product emphasizes data provenance through a documented processing chain, including training data, context layers, and parcel framework.
- Public sharing of underlying data is a theme in monitoring governance; the guide notes that some users may require careful handling of detailed pixel and parcel data due to privacy or proprietary constraints.
- Metadata and data management are integral (MMU, spatial framework changes, and differences from previous LCM versions).
- The guide provides a formal validation Appendix and a full dataset list (Appendix 5) to support data governance, traceability, and reproducibility.

## Appendices and supplementary information (highlights)
- Appendix 1 and 2: Notes on UKCEH Land Cover Classes and their relationship to BAP Broad Habitats; class definitions and training considerations.
- Appendix 3: Recommended color mapping for displaying each land cover class.
- Appendix 4: Detailed correspondence matrices and accuracy statistics for each class, including producer’s and user’s accuracies.
- Appendix 5: Full list of LCM2020 datasets and their official names, extents, and resolutions.

## Key takeaways for monitoring frameworks
- LCM2020 provides an annually updated, satellite-based framework for standardized monitoring of UK land cover, with explicit data products (10m pixel, 25m parcels, 20m NI outputs) and a transparent processing chain.
- Bootstrap Training combined with Random Forest enables wall-to-wall mapping without new field campaigns, facilitating rapid refreshes and change detection over time.
- Validation shows a robust overall accuracy (~79.2%), with detailed class-level performance documented to support uncertainty assessment in monitoring programs.
- The product links land cover classes to BAP Broad Habitats while clarifying limitations and spectral-confusion issues, aiding alignment with biodiversity and habitat monitoring needs.
- Data governance and metadata considerations are embedded in the presentation, emphasizing provenance, reproducibility, and the trade-offs between high detail (10m pixels) and generalisation (parcel frameworks).
