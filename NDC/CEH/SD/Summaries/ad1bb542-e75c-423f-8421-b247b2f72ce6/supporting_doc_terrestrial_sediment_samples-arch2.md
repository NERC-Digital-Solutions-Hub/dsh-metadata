# Collection, generation methods and quality control

- Purpose and scope
  - Document describes collection, preparation, analytical methods, and quality control for terrestrial sediment samples from seven sites across Harehill and Swineshaw Moors, Stalybridge, Tameside.
  - Aims align with standardized environmental monitoring: consistent data to assess environmental health and policy-relevant outputs over time.

- Sampling design and collection
  - Seven sites sampled across the stream network: Near Harehill (Sites 1 and 2), Lower/Middle/Upper Iron Tongue (Sites 3–5), Higher Swineshaw (Site 6), Iron Tongue Hill (Site 7).
  - Time Integrated Mass Samplers (TIMS) used; samplers removed from uprights and contents transferred to 5-L containers.
  - Interval chosen to accumulate sufficient sediment mass for analysis.

- Sample handling and preparation
  - Samples stored at <4 °C for four days before processing.
  - Supernatant siphoned off carefully to avoid disturbing sediment; supernatant < 0.5% of total sediment mass.
  - Sediment rinsed from container, dried at 40 °C, and dry mass measured for further analysis.

- Site details
  - Site numbers and Ordnance Survey grid references provided for all seven locations (e.g., Near Harehill, Site 1; Far Harehill, Site 2; Lower/Middle/Upper Iron Tongue; Higher Swineshaw; Iron Tongue Hill).

- Geochemical analysis (XRF)
  - Elemental composition determined by X-ray fluorescence using XEPOS 3 Energydispersive XRF.
  - Sample prep: light grinding, light pressing; measurements in a helium atmosphere with Pd/Co excitation and a silicon drift detector.
  - QA: daily standardization with 18 certified reference materials; accuracy routinely verified.
  - Organic correction: loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured by heating to 105 °C (moisture removal) and 450 °C (organic combustion) to correct elemental contents.

- Particle size analysis
  - Laser granulometry using Coulter LS 13 320 to assess distributions from 0.375–2000 μm.
  - Organic matter removed by digestion in H2O2; samples dispersed in Na6O18P6 and sonicated.
  - Three repeats per sample with outliers removed to reduce intra-sample noise.
  - Median particle size (D50) reported; instrument calibration and QA procedures described.

- Data structure, values, and units
  - Data organized with clear identifiers: sample_id and location.
  - Elemental analysis reported as mg/g; elements include a broad list (e.g., Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni, Zn, Zr, etc.) and oxides/modern corrections (e.g., MgO, SiO2, Fe2O3, P2O5, CaCO3, Rh, Tc, Pd, etc.).
  - Elemental ratios provided (e.g., Fe/Mn, Si/Al, Zr/K, Zr/Ti) to assess geochemical relationships.
  - Particle size data include D50 in millimeters.
  - LOI values provided as percentages.
  - Data fields include notes on missing values (blanks) and detection limits (values listed with '<' indicating values at limit of detection).
  - Emphasis on standardized units and structured data to facilitate sharing, reuse, and integration with other datasets.
