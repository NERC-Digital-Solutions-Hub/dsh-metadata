# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Uses the ITE Land Classification as the primary stratification framework to ensure representative sampling across Great Britain.
  - Built to support time-series analysis and to inform policy and management decisions.

- Core concepts: stratified sampling and the ITE Land Classification
  - Stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and to capture variability across land types.
  - Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to group land into discrete classes (initially 32, later expanded to around 40–45 with country subdivisions).
  - Sampling unit: 1 km squares; centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid used for initial classification; surrounding squares also allocated to classes.
  - Sampling within each class: eight (later adjusted) squares surveyed per class during early surveys; subsequent surveys increased or redistributed squares to improve national and country-specific estimates.

- Historical development and key surveys
  - 1978 (CS1978): First national ecological survey; 32 ITE Land Classes; 256 squares (8 per class) surveyed; construction of national habitat estimates via class-area proportions.
  - 1984 (CS1984): 12 squares per class (384 total); refinement based on land-use focus; use of 1978 Land Classification for estimates.
  - 1990 (CS1990): All GB squares reclassified; 508 squares surveyed; integration with first Land Cover Map of GB; national estimates recalculated with revised framework.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Transition to a refined Land Classification to support Scotland- and England/Wales-specific estimates; expansion to 40 Land Classes; development of country-unit estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); inclusion of upland habitat modules as needed.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-specific reporting formalized; subdivisions created for country units (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 45 strata; addition of 43 Welsh squares to ensure adequate Welsh representation; adjustments to English sampling in response to Welsh changes; upland module expanded for better England/Wales upland estimates.

- Separate country estimates and sampling adjustments
  - Rationale: policy and legislation requirements for England, Scotland, and Wales necessitated country-specific reporting.
  - Implementation: subdivision of Land Classes by country units; aggregation of underrepresented rump classes within each country; targeted additional sampling to ensure adequate representation of new classes (minimum 6 squares per class per country).

- Uplands and Wales-focused modules
  - CS2000 included an upland/marginal upland survey module to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - CS2007 implemented Wales-focused sampling structure and Welsh-class subdivisions to support Wales-only reporting.

- Data outputs, structure, and references
  - Tables and figures document sample numbers, class distributions, and country sampling frameworks (e.g., Tables 2–4, Figures 4–7).
  - Summary figures show how Land Class maps and sample square distributions evolved across surveys.
  - Note on national estimates: changing the Land Classification basis affects consistency of stock estimates; two approaches exist (latest country-specific classification vs. original cross-country classification); for consistency with individual surveys, the latest country-specific framework is preferred.

- Practical considerations for analysts
  - The sampling framework is explicitly tied to the ITE Land Classification and its evolution; shifts in classification affect comparability over time.
  - Separate country reporting improves relevance for policy but introduces complexity in maintaining cross-survey comparability.
  - The strategy emphasizes representativeness, documentation of data sources, and transparent methods for calculating national and country-level estimates.
