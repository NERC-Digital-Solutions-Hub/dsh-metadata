# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
  - Shows how the ITE Land Classification underpins stratified sampling and national habitat estimates.
  - Traces evolution from initial stratification to country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and upland emphasis.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain’s landscapes.
  - ITE Land Classification: a hierarchical, environmentally based stratification of land into classes that guide sampling and national estimates.
  - Use of 1 km squares as sampling units, with systematic incorporation of surrounding context (e.g., center squares plus adjacent squares) to form classified strata.

- The ITE Land Classification: historical development
  - Origin (1970s): 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes; initial national framework built from a subset of classified squares due to computing limits.
  - 1978 CS: first large-scale field survey using a gridded, stratified random approach; eight samples per class envisioned for robust estimates.
  - 1984 CS: sampling expanded to 12 squares per class; represents a survey focused more on land use and landscape features.
  - 1990 CS: all GB squares classified (land cover maps linked); 508 squares surveyed; refinement to incorporate urban/sea corrections; national estimates recalculated with an expanded, all-squares framework.
  - 1998 CS: land classification expanded to 40 classes to support Scotland reporting; overall number of squares increased to improve regional estimates.
  - 2000 CS: introduction of separate country-based estimates (England & Wales vs. Scotland); sub-division and aggregation of classes; additional squares to balance representation; upland habitat sampling added as a module.

- Sampling framework by survey year (highlights)
  - CS1978: Center squares (1228) classified; four surrounding squares allocated per center; total 6039 classified squares; 8 squares per class; national estimates derived from class means and class area.
  - CS1984: 12 km2 squares per class; total 384 surveyed; maintained CS1978 framework with increased sample density.
  - CS1990: all GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; linked to first Land Cover Map; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - CS2000: land classes expanded; separate country estimates introduced; 40 strata; 19 additional squares to England & Wales; 11 extra squares to balance between England and Wales; uplands module added for England & Wales.
  - CS2007: Wales-only reporting required; Wales sampled more intensively with country-unit land classes; creation of five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 43 additional Welsh squares; overall 45 strata; English class counts adjusted (some classes with fewer squares); Wales reporting prioritized for policy needs.

- Separate country estimates and country-unit framework
  - England with Wales vs. Scotland-based estimates to support country-specific reporting.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit variants; “rump” classes in a country aggregated with similar classes to maintain representation.
  - Isle of Man samples replaced to ensure country-unit integrity.
  - Wales required more granular sub-division and dedicated sampling to improve Wales-only estimates.

- Uplands and Wales-specific adjustments
  - CS2000 introduced an uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland regions of England and Wales.
  - CS2007 increased Welsh sampling to support Wales-only environmental policy needs; five new Welsh land classes introduced; total Welsh sampling increased to ensure minimum representations.

- Outputs and GIS relevance
  - Land Classification maps and associated class-based sampling strata enable map-based visualization of habitat types, land cover, and change over time.
  - The stratified sampling framework supports spatially explicit national and country-level estimates that can be mapped and analyzed in GIS.
  - Tables and figures summarize class distributions, sampling numbers, and rates (e.g., Table 2, Table 3, Table 4; Figures 1–7), illustrating how sampling density and class representation evolve across surveys.

- Considerations on data consistency and national estimates
  - Changing the underlying Land Classification affects cross-survey comparability of national stock estimates.
  - Preference for using the latest classification within a survey for consistency, while recognizing cross-survey comparability challenges.
  - Decisions balance the need for country-specific reporting (Scotland, Wales, England) with the desire for consistent, repeatable estimates over time.

- Endnotes and history
  - The document includes a brief history of the ITE Land Classification and acknowledgments, as well as references for further reading on methodology, classification development, and CS outputs.
