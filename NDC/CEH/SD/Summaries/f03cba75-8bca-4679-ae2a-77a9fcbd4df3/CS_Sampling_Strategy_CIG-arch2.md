# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Purpose and scope
- Document describes the field survey sampling strategy used in Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Emphasizes the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its role as the sampling framework for national environmental monitoring.
- Highlights the need to understand the time-series basis for detecting change and informing policy.

## Key concepts and foundations
- Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain’s diverse landscapes.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes used to group land into classes for stratification and sampling.
- Sample unit: 1 km squares; larger land units are aggregated into land classes for analysis.
- Early use of Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to define initial land classes; later evolution to broader surrogates as classification expanded.
- National estimates derived by combining per-square habitat measurements with land-class area; outputs include habitat area estimates and change over time.

## Evolution of the sampling framework by survey year

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
  - ISA used to create 32 land classes from environmental attributes of 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1215 of 1228 classified).
  - Total sampling: 8 squares per land class, 256 squares overall.
  - National habitat estimates calculated as mean habitat area per square in each class times the area of the class.

- 1984 – Second field survey
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification; outputs published with Landscape Changes in Britain.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey
  - Land Classification revised to classify every 1 km square in GB; urban and sea corrections applied.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping from earlier surveys.
  - Results published as Countryside Survey 1990 main report; first links to Land Cover Map of GB.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification and fourth field survey
  - Expanded to better support Scotland reporting; land classes increased to 40.
  - National estimates began to be produced with a revised framework that allowed more detailed regional reporting.

- 2000 – Developments leading to CS2000
  - Addressed issues from CS1990 including representation of country units (England with Wales, Scotland) and improving upland habitat estimates.
  - Separate country estimates introduced by subdividing land classes into country-unit versions and adjusting class distributions; 40 strata became 40-plus adjustments.
  - Additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new/altered classes; upland habitat module introduced to improve accuracy for uplands in England and Wales.

- 2007 – Developments for CS2007 (Welsh-only reporting)
  - Wales required Wales-only estimates post-devolution; England and Wales classes split into country-unit variants (creating five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and resulting in 45 strata.
  - Wales received 43 extra squares to ensure minimum representation; some English classes retained lower square counts due to precision considerations.
  - Updated maps showing revised land-class framework for England with Wales and Scotland; sample square maps provided.

## Separate country estimates and upland module
- England, Scotland, and Wales now reported separately; the framework subdivides Land Classes by country-unit where needed.
- Wales-specific adjustments and additional Welsh sampling to improve country-specific precision.
- Upland module (CS2000) added to better estimate habitats in upland areas of England and Wales, addressing under-sampling in these zones.

## Outputs and data management
- Outputs include time-series habitat estimates, landscape change statistics, and supporting maps.
- National estimates are tied to the Land Classification framework and the recorded habitat data per 1 km square.
- Tables and figures (e.g., CS2000 and CS2007 summaries) illustrate the number of squares and sampling rates across classes and countries.
- Emphasis on ensuring the data are suitable for national, regional, and country-specific environmental policy reporting.

## Practical implications for analysts monitoring the environment
- The framework provides a standardized, transparent basis for comparing environmental health over time across the UK.
- Changes in Land Classification require careful interpretation when comparing across surveys; the document discusses consistency considerations for national estimates.
- Data products support policy evaluation and monitoring, including the ability to produce country-specific time-series and upland habitat assessments.
- Data handling includes storing outputs and making underlying data accessible for scrutiny and reuse.

## Challenges and considerations
- Balancing representativeness with precision, especially for Wales and upland regions.
- Ensuring comparability across surveys amid evolving land classification schemes.
- Providing country-specific estimates in a devolution context (England with Wales, Scotland, Wales).
- The need to combine dataset value with other relevant data to maximize usefulness beyond single-use outputs.
