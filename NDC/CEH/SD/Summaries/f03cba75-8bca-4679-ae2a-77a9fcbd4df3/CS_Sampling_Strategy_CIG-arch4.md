# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the sampling strategy for the Countryside Survey field component up to 2007, the latest in a 30-year evolution of the ITE Land Classification.
- Purpose: provide a robust, stratified sampling framework to monitor countryside habitats and land use across Great Britain, enabling national estimates and country-specific reporting.
- Emphasizes linking sampling to an environmental stratification (ITE Land Classification) to ensure representative coverage of varied land forms and uses.
- Strategy has evolved to meet policy needs and devolved government requirements (England, Scotland, Wales; upland considerations; Isle of Man adjustments).

## The ITE Land Classification and Sampling Framework
- The Land Classification is the core stratification tool, grouping land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- Early approach used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to derive 32 land classes for GB in the 1970s–80s.
- Sampling units are 1 km squares; a centre square is classified and the surrounding four squares are included to capture local variability.
- The framework aims to minimize bias via stratified, random sampling, ensuring representative coverage of ecological variation.

## Chronology of Countryside Survey Sampling (1978–2007)
- 1978 (Initial survey): 32 land classes; 8 samples per class; total 256 squares surveyed; classification based on 1228 centre squares plus surrounding squares (6039 km² represented).
- 1984 (Land use survey): sampling increased to 12 squares per class; 384 total; still within the 32-class framework.
- 1990 (CS1990 all-squares classification): expanded to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed; added Land Cover Map linkage; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
- 1998–2000 (CS2000): major revision to support country-specific reporting; land classes expanded to 40; introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland); subdivided classes into country-unit variants; added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation; uplands module added to bolster upland habitat estimates.
- 2007 (CS2007): further refinements to accommodate Wales-only reporting; introduced country-unit subdivisions (five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); overall 45 strata; added 43 Welsh squares; England adjustments minor but maintained reporting precision; Wales received enhanced representation; complementary upland adjustments incorporated through Module 4 and related planning.

## National vs. Country-Specific Estimation
- National estimates are calculated from the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class, multiplied by the area of each class.
- Over time, the framework moved from GB-wide estimates to separate country-unit estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) to reflect devolved policy needs.
- Careful treatment of cross-country classifications and class representations to maintain consistency within surveys while enabling country-specific reporting.

## Upland and Welsh Adjustments
- CS2000 introduced an uplands module to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- CS2007 added Wales-focused class subdivisions and Welsh squares to enhance Wales-only reporting, while England retained most configurations with a few reductions.
- Isle of Man sample squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced to better align with England-focused country-unit reporting.

## Data Outputs and Documentation
- Outputs include:
  - Maps of Land Class distributions and sampling squares (e.g., Figures showing original and revised classifications across years).
  - Tables detailing the number of squares surveyed by class and by country for each survey year (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - Country-specific sampling frames and revised classification maps for England with Wales and Scotland (CS2000, CS2007).
- Notes on consistency highlight that switching classifications affects national stock estimates; a recommendation exists to use the latest classification within a single survey for consistency.

## Data Governance, Quality, and Learnings for Data Leaders
- The strategy demonstrates the importance of a stable yet adaptable data framework that can:
  - Support both national and country-specific policy needs.
  - Evolve land classifications to maintain representation across changing political boundaries and boundaries of responsibility (England, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man).
  - Balance the need for detailed Welsh and upland reporting with overall survey precision.
- Key governance considerations:
  - Documenting class definitions, subdivisions, and changes over time (to support metadata and longitudinal analyses).
  - Ensuring discoverability and traceability of classification maps, sample frames, and estimation methodologies.
  - Assessing the impact of classification updates on comparability across survey years and between countries.

## Takeaways for Data Leaders
- A robust, classification-based stratified framework is essential for credible, scalable data assets intended for long-term monitoring and cross-jurisdiction reporting.
- Growing policy needs may require country-specific subdivisions and additional sampling to maintain precision in smaller or more distinct regions.
- Clear documentation of classification schemes, sampling changes, and estimation methods is critical for data discoverability, usability, and trust among stakeholders.
