# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on a 30-year evolution of the ITE Land Classification to stratify sampling and enable time-series change detection.
  - Emphasizes the need to link sampling design with ecological/environmental classification for robust national estimates.

- Core concept: stratified random sampling via the ITE Land Classification
  - Land Classification used to carve GB into discrete strata (land classes) to ensure representative sampling.
  - Stratification reduces bias and improves precision when estimating national habitat areas.
  - Sampling combines classified squares to form a national sample, complemented by surrounding squares for context.

- The ITE Land Classification: evolution and purpose
  - Origin: 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) using Indicator Species Analysis and multivariate methods.
  - Purpose: provide a consistent framework to stratify the landscape for ecological survey and estimation.

- Survey history and sampling framework by year
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
    - 1 km squares classified; 8 squares per class surveyed (256 total).
    - Use of ISA to group quadrats into vegetation/land classes; national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square times class area.
  - 1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - 12 squares per land class surveyed (384 total); consistency with 1978 framework.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
    - Expanded to classify every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Revisions to support better regional/local estimations; inclusion of the first Land Cover Map linked to this program.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification & Fourth Field Survey)
    - Classification updated to enable separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
    - 569 squares surveyed; adjustments to separate national estimates by country.
  - 2000 (CS2000 & Fifth Field Survey)
    - Emphasis on separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland).
    - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions; aggregation where needed; additional squares to ensure representation of new classes.
    - Uplands module added to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
  - 2007 (CS2007 & Sixth Field Survey)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements drive Wales-specific adjustments.
    - Creation of country-unit sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - 43 additional Welsh squares; minimum 6 squares in each Welsh class; minor reductions in some English classes accepted for precision.
    - Wales and England data collections aligned to support Wales-only and England+Wales reporting.

- Data products and outputs
  - Land Classification maps illustrating current classification schemes by country (England with Wales, Scotland; Wales-specific refinements).
  - Tables summarizing the number of squares surveyed per class and per survey year (e.g., CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - National and country-based estimates derived from class-area multipliers and mean habitat areas per square.
  - Notes on the impact of changing land classifications on cross-survey comparability and consistency of national estimates.

- Outputs, outputs promotion, and data governance
  - Outputs include habitat area estimates, land-class maps, and change statistics across survey years.
  - Acknowledges the need for consistency when using different classifications across surveys; discusses trade-offs between cross-survey consistency and country-specific reporting.
  - Recognizes that changes in classification affect national estimates and requires careful interpretation and documentation.

- Uplands and country-specific considerations
  - Additional uplands module (CS2000) to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
  - Wales-specific refinements for Wales-only reporting; explicit sub-division of land classes to reflect country-unit reporting.
  - Isle of Man and cross-border considerations noted in framework adjustments.

- Practical data support implications
  - Time spent understanding the ask and aligning with user needs is critical due to evolving classifications and country-specific reporting requirements.
  - Handling patchy data and ensuring representation across many classes and countries is essential for robust estimates.
  - Requires clear mapping between old and new land classifications to maintain time-series integrity.
  - Data products should enable self-service exploration by end users, including dashboards or tables showing habitat estimates by land class, country, and year, with provenance and classification changes clearly documented.
