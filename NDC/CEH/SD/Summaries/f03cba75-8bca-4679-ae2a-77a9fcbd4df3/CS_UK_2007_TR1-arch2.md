# CS Technical Report No 1/07: Field Mapping Handbook v1.0

## Purpose and Scope
- Establishes a GIS-based framework to record Broad Habitats (BHs) and Priority Habitats (PHs) and track changes over time.
- Enables standardized time-series reporting to support environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Introduces a digital data model and workflow for consistent outputs (maps, reports, charts) and for sharing across portals.

## Target Audience and Roles
- Analysts monitoring the environment using standardised monitoring datasets.
- Field surveyors and organisations with predefined monitoring responsibilities.
- Emphasis on consistent data capture, quality assurance, and data sharing.

## Data Workflow and Outputs
- Data are collected from established sources, then verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed.
- Outputs include clear reports, maps, and charts; datasets stored/uploaded to appropriate portals.
- Focus on reporting habitat status and change over time for scientific and policy applications.

## Habitat Classification Framework
- Broad Habitats (BHs) as high-level classifications; Priority Habitats (PHs) nest within BHs where relevant.
- Distinguishes enclosed (more static boundaries) vs unenclosed (upland, dynamic) habitat boundaries.
- Time-series reporting of BH/PH status supports monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Data Models and Attributes
- Vegetation and habitat attributes include primary and secondary attributes, indicator species, canopy cover, and detailed woodland attributes.
- Woodland components described with canopy structure and forms (e.g., belt of trees, clumps, linear features) and associated species data.
- Non-woody features (boundaries, margins, wetlands) described with domain-specific BH/PH attributes.

## The CS Surveyor Digital Mapping System
- CS Surveyor is a customized ArcMap-based extension for CS2007 data capture.
- Provides data frames, layers, and pre-set symbology; supports editing of Areas (polygons), Lines (linear features), and Points (point features).
- Includes a robust helpdesk/update mechanism; prioritises capture of extent and change over ultra-precise spatial accuracy.
- Requires user login, data verification, and standardized editing sessions; emphasizes versioned data management.

## Editing, Data Capture and Change Attribution
- Areas: edit attributes, split/merge polygons, manage components; assign change status (real change vs. error correction) and update BHPH baselines.
- Lines: record and edit linear features (fences, hedges, banks); manage events with attributes (length, condition, margins, etc.); minimums (e.g., 5 m) and protection of boundary topology.
- Points: document individual features (trees, ponds, water bodies); support for multiple components and veteran-tree attributes.
- Change attribution: distinguish real changes since 1998 from corrections (errors) and manage new baselines when habitat subdivisions apply.
- Workflow includes advanced tools for line creation, modification, cutting, reshaping, copying from other layers, and shared-node editing to maintain topology.

## Pond Mapping Protocol
- Map all ponds within each square; use a CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet.
- Select a survey pond per square for detailed condition assessment (pond sampling) via predefined/random processes.
- Boundary decisions account for wetland vegetation transitions, water marks, and connections to other water bodies.
- Defines temporary ponds and complex fen/marsh contexts; records ponds even if small or previously mapped.

## Specialist Attributes and Non-native Species
- Record presence of non-native species within habitats to support biodiversity assessments and habitat context.

## Data Governance and Sharing
- Datasets are prepared for sharing across portals with versioned edits.
- Methodology supports broad data reuse for policy evaluation and scientific analyses beyond the immediate square.

## End-State and Implications for Analysts
- Delivers a comprehensive, GIS-based, standardized framework for mapping BHs and PHs with detailed vegetation and woodland keys.
- Establishes digital workflows, editing tools, and procedures for change detection, data quality, data sharing, and pond-based sampling.
- Supports long-term environmental monitoring and policy assessment through time-series habitat data and transparent data governance.
