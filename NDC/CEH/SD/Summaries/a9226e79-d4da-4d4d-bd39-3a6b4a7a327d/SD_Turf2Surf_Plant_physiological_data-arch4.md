# Details of data structure for the dataset

- Context: Supplement to the supporting documentation for Turf2Surf data series; focuses on plant physiological measurements in North Wales and Northwest England (2013, 2014, 2016) as described in Turf2Surf_Plant_physiological_data.csv.
- Datasets sharing the first 9 columns: 
  - Plant structural measurements (North Wales/NW England, 2013 and 2014)
  - Plant aboveground and belowground standing biomass in the Conwy catchment (2013 and 2014)
  - Soil carbon data in the Conwy catchment (2013 and 2014)
  - Soil physical, chemical and biological measurements in the Conwy catchment (2013 and 2014)
  - Plant aboveground and belowground standing biomass in the Conwy catchment (2013 and 2014)
- Shared data structure (Columns A–I):
  - A: Site Number (unique identifier)
  - B: Habitat
  - C: Habitat Description
  - D: Site name
  - E: Ecosystem Component (plant, soil, or roots)
  - F: If Plant, plant species; otherwise NA
  - G: Plot number (1–4)
  - H: Replicate number
  - I: Soil depth interval (for soil/roots)
- Additional data columns (J–R; 9 extra columns; total 96 rows):
  - J: Year of measurement
  - K: Vcmax — Maximum rate of carboxylation at 25°C (µmol m^-2 s^-1)
  - L: Jmax — Electron transport capacity at 25°C (µmol m^-2 s^-1)
  - M: Asat — Photosynthetic rate at saturating irradiance and 400 ppm CO2 at 25°C (µmol m^-2 s^-1)
  - N: Leaf mass area (gm^-2)
  - O: Foliar nitrogen content (%)
  - P: Foliar phosphorus content (%)
  - Q: Specific leaf area (cm² g^-1)
  - R: Comments (free text)
- Data quality notes:
  - NA indicates measurements not performed
  - At sites 5, 7, 14, and 19, leaves were sampled in 2015 for re-analysis of foliar N and P only
- Practical considerations for data management:
  - Understand data provenance and maintain consistent metadata for cross-dataset compatibility
  - Verify data content and format during integration, noting NAs and site-specific re-analysis
  - Prioritize data discoverability and governance (format, quality, metadata, updates)
  - Consider co-ownership and collaboration practices when using datasets across the broader data community
  - Plan for data gaps and potential new data collection to fill granularity or coverage needs
