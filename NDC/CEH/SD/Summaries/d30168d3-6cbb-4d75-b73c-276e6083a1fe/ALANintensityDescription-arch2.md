# Effects of artificial light on multi-trophic population dynamics

- Aim
  - Use experimental and observational data to understand how different intensities of artificial light at night affect multi-trophic population dynamics, enabling assessment of environmental health and policy performance over time.

- Study design and setting
  - Field experiment: randomized block design (6 blocks) with eight light treatments: control (no light) and 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 lux.
  - Mesocosms: 48 cages containing plant–insect communities; each treatment replicated six times.
  - Experimental system: two plants (broad bean Vicia faba and barley Hordeum vulgare) with three aphid species (Aphis fabae, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Megoura viciae) and their parasitoids (Lysiphlebus fabarum, Aphidius ervi, Aphidius megourae), linked by a generalist parasitoid Praon dorsale.
  - Field data collection: weekly counts of all species on all plants for the 9-week field period starting 29 July 2016.
  - Plant biomass: measured as dry weight after final harvest (one pot per mesocosm; 48 mesocosms); some biomass data missing due to label loss.
  - Lab experiment (no-aphid control): separate 30-mesocosm setup with broad beans only to assess light effects on plant biomass (3 weeks).

- Measurements and responses
  - Insect population dynamics: counts of aphids (including winged/unwinged morphs) and parasitoid mummies (successful attacks) over time.
  - Parasitoid behavior: experiments assessing parasitoid location (on plant, cage side, or ceiling) and attack rates under varying light intensities, with both day and night conditions and dark/light cycles.
  - Plant responses: biomass dry weight (g) for field communities and for the aphid-free plant-only experiment.

- Experimental procedures for light treatments
  - Light intensities applied at plant height (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 lux) using white LED illumination.
  - Behavioral and attack-rate experiments conducted under controlled light/dark conditions, with specific durations (e.g., 24-hour exposure for initial parasitism, 12-hour intervals for day/night tests, 2-week post-exposure counts).

- Data quality control and structure
  - Post-entry quality checks comparing dataset variables to hardcopy records.
  - Data organized into 8 files capturing insect population dynamics, plant biomass, and parasitoid behavior/attack data.
  - Key variables include: block, mesocosm identity, treatment lux levels (Treat.lux, Light.lux), aphid counts (M.v, M.v.w, A.p, A.f, A.f.w, S.a, S.a.w), parasitoid counts (L.f, A.e, A.m, P.dor.m, P.dor.a, P.dor.s), plant biomass (Plantbiomass.g), host density (Hostdensity), aphid mummies (Aphid.mummies), and detailed behavioral/location indicators (e.g., Parasitoid.on.plant, Parasitoid.on.side.of.cage, Parasitoid.ceiling).

- Data structure and accessibility
  - Data derived from field observations and controlled experiments conducted at Penryn Campus, University of Exeter (field site and climate-controlled room).
  - 8 data files capturing comprehensive multi-trophic dynamics and associated experimental conditions.
  - Datasets were prepared to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals; ongoing consideration for enhancing data reuse by integrating with other environmental datasets.

- Key considerations for analysts and policy evaluators
  - The design enables assessment of how incremental nocturnal light intensities influence multi-trophic interactions, including herbivore pressure, parasitoid efficacy, and plant growth.
  - The presence of missing plant biomass data and detailed variable labeling notes requires careful data cleaning and documentation when integrating with other datasets.
  - There is an explicit focus on enabling access to underlying data and maximizing dataset value through potential cross-dataset linkages for broader environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
