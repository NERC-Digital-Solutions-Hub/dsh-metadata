# Understanding Environmental Knowledge Controversies: the Case for Flood Risk Management , 2007-2010 Hydrology Data USER GUIDE

## Context and Aims
- Examine how flood risk knowledge claims are produced, standardised, and contested, focusing on modelling practices and their role in policy.
- Develop and test new ways to model flood risk that incorporate local knowledge and context.
- Create a publicly accessible, interactive resource to help scientists, policymakers, and citizens interrogate environmental knowledge controversies.
- Transfer lessons to other environmental risk management fields and promote interdisciplinary, participatory science.

## Methods and Work Packages (Overview)
- Work Package 1: Environmental Knowledge Production and Controversy
  - Interviews with scientists and policymakers; ethnography of modelling teams; archival analysis of flood science history.
  - Analyze how modelling practices inform flood risk management and how uncertainties are communicated (or obscured) in policy.
- Work Package 2: MIR Science and Modelling (Knowledge-Theoretic Modelling)
  - Develop knowledge-theoretic models co-produced with local publics via Competency Groups (CGs).
  - Produce bespoke, place-specific models grounded in experiential, theoretical, and data-based knowledge.
- Work Package 3: New Forms of Interdisciplinary Working (Competency Groups)
  - Create 2 CGs (Pickering, Ryedale in North Yorkshire; Uckfield in East Sussex) combining university researchers and local residents.
  - Bi-monthly hands-on modelling sessions; artefacts (maps, photos, videos, policy docs) to mediate knowledge claims.
- Work Package 4: Transferring Lessons and Skills
  - Develop a web-based civic resource (Prezi-based) to document and disseminate CG methodology and knowledge controversies.
  - Test the approach in other diffuse environmental issues (ecology policy and climate modelling engagement).

## Key Findings on Flood Risk Knowledge and Modelling
- Modelling knowledge claims are inherently uncertain and provisional; certainty is often presented as final in policy contexts.
- Standardisation pressures (software packages, datasets, contractor norms) obscure modelling uncertainties in public-facing outputs.
- Public controversy emerges where environmental events (floods) heighten concerns about problem framing, data quality, and who holds expertise.
- Environmental knowledge controversies can be constructive, enabling redistribution of expertise and new public formations when approached as experimental, not strictly instrumental.
- Interdisciplinarity is challenging in practice; predefined ideal types of collaboration differ from the messy realities of fieldwork and governance.

## Knowledge-Theoretic Modelling: A New Approach
- Move away from purely data- or model-centric approaches to “knowledge-theoretic” modelling, foregrounding experiential, theoretical, and data-based knowledge.
- CGs co-produce models that reflect local knowledge and aims, yielding bespoke, place-specific outputs rather than transferable, one-size-fits-all tools.
- Two case-study models:
  - Bunding (Pickering): upstream small bunds to hold back floodwater during extreme events; interactive tool to test storage and discharge; validated against downstream 2D hydraulic modelling.
  - Overflow (Uckfield): suite of small riparian interventions; efficient testing via hybrid static-dynamic analyses; Monte Carlo and forward-only optimisation to identify positive interventions and their interactions.

## Competency Groups (CGs): Structure, Practice, and Principles
- Composition: 5–6 university (natural/social scientists) + 5–8 local members; bi-monthly meetings; artefact-mediated discussions; project website and group blog.
- Core aims of CGs:
  - Interrogate existing flood knowledge claims and management practices.
  - Allow affected residents to test alternative problem framings and interventions.
  - Produce collective knowledge claims and an envoy (publicly accessible model) to influence debate and policy.
- Six distinctive commitments:
  1) Knowledge is made through both discursive and practical, object-mediated processes.
  2) Participants learn the issue from personal, experiential standpoints.
  3) Disagreement is generative and welcomed.
  4) Collective competences emerge from collaboration.
  5) Expertise is redistributed through reconfiguring how knowledge is produced and evidenced.
  6) New publics emerge, enabling minority perspectives to object and intervene.
- Ethics and participation: individuals participate in a personal capacity; speak from experience; respect diverse viewpoints; learn collectively to transfer lessons.
- Impact: CGs generate models and outputs that travel beyond the original groups, becoming public envoy devices (e.g., the bund-model).

## Case Studies: Pickering/Bund-Model and Uckfield/Overflow
- Pickering, Ryedale (Bund-Model)
  - Local controversy over a proposed flood wall; EA’s funding withdrawal led to stasis in policy.
  - CG developed the bund-model: distributed, upstream storage using small bunds; interactive testing of configurations.
  - Public exhibition (Civic Centre) showcased CG work and the bund-model, attracting media and officials; helped reposition the controversy toward upstream, catchment-scale management.
  - Outcomes: bund-model publicly deployed as an envoy; later integrated into a national demonstration project; funding secured for upstream measures.
- Uckfield, Sussex (Overflow)
  - CG focus on upstream storage limitations of bunds and exploration of multiple small interventions (CRIMs): debris dams, riparian planting, re-meandering, hedgerows, etc.
  - Overflow model enables rapid uncertainty analysis and evaluation of many interventions; supports optimisation (forward-only and Monte Carlo) to identify combinations with positive flood risk reduction while considering practical constraints.

## Going Public and Hybrid Forums
- The bund-model exhibition and media coverage helped create a hybrid forum, bringing together scientists, residents, and policymakers.
- Official notices later acknowledged upstream storage concepts and the value of public-engaged, science-led approaches.
- The process demonstrates how knowledge controversies can catalyse new publics and political attachments, transforming how flood risk management is conceived and funded.

## Data, Publication, and Knowledge Transfer
- Data and outputs from the project (interviews, model scripts, CG materials) archived with ESRC data resources.
- Publication record includes multiple papers across science studies, hydrology, geography, policy, and philosophy of science; active dissemination at conferences and through media.
- Web resource and Prezi-based materials provide a platform for others to experiment with CGs and the knowledge controversy approach in other environmental domains.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring and Policy
- Transparent communication of modelling uncertainties is essential to avoid over-certainty in policy outputs.
- Standardisation should be balanced with explicit representation of provenance, assumptions, and data limitations.
- Public engagement should extend earlier in the modelling lifecycle, including co-production of objectives and parameters.
- Data collection, curation, and archiving in public-facing models enable reproducibility and independent scrutiny.
- Interdisciplinary, participatory modelling (as in CGs) can yield context-specific tools that are more acceptable to stakeholders and policymakers, potentially accelerating implementation of effective risk reduction measures.

## Future Directions and Recommendations
- Extend the Knowledge Controversies approach to other environmental risk fields (ecology, climate models) to build generalizable methods for public engagement and model co-production.
- Further develop knowledge-theoretic modelling to enhance specificity, transparency, and accessibility of model assumptions and outputs.
- Expand the CG methodology through a publicly accessible web resource to enable civic experimentation and policy impact in other diffuse land-management and environmental risk contexts.

## Data Archiving and Publication Status
- Data: Interview transcripts and modelling scripts archived with ESRC data collections.
- Publications: Numerous papers published or in press; ongoing preparation for additional outputs; conference presentations and public lectures continue.
