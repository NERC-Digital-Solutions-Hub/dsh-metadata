# Understanding Environmental Knowledge Controversies: the Case for Flood Risk Management , 2007-2010 Hydrology Data USER GUIDE

- A research project exploring how flood risk science knowledge is produced, standardised, and contested, and how public engagement can reshape expertise and policy.
- Combines natural and social science perspectives to experiment with new interdisciplinary methods and public participation.

## Aims and Core Questions

- Analyze how flood risk knowledge claims (especially modelling) are produced and inform policy and practice.
- Investigate public controversy around flood risk in two localities (Ryedale/Pickering, North Yorkshire, and Uckfield, West Sussex) using Competency Groups (CGs).
- Develop knowledge-theoretic flood modelling approaches that incorporate local experiential knowledge.
- Transfer lessons to other environmental risk fields and create an interactive web resource to enable others to interrogate environmental knowledge controversies.

## Key Concepts and Theoretical Framework

- Knowledge controversies can be generative, redistributing expertise and creating new publics with political capabilities.
- Whatmore & Landström draw on Isabelle Stengers’ experimental constructivism to slow down reasoning and co-produce knowledge with affected publics.
- Six distinctive commitments of Competency Groups (CGs):
  - Focus on knowledge practices (discursive and practical reasoning with artefacts).
  - Apprenticeship to the issue, grounding participants in problem understanding.
  - Staging of associative events (improvisation where outcomes cannot be fully anticipated).
  - Generation of collective competences (hybrid reasoning across participants).
  - Redistribution of expertise (integrating diverse knowledge forms).
  - Exercise of new publics (minoritarian, dissenting publics that can influence policy).
- Public engagement is not just inclusion but redistribution and rearticulation of expertise to create new policy-relevant outcomes.

## Methods and Work Packages (WPs)

- Work Package 1: Flood science knowledge production
  - Methods: interviews with flood risk scientists and policy-makers, ethnography with modelling practitioners, archival study of historical development of flood science.
  - Goals: understand how modelling practices become standardised and how uncertainty is managed in practice, policy, and contractual contexts.
- Work Package 2: Knowledge-theoretic modelling
  - Co-produced models developed with CGs that integrate experiential, theoretical (Newtonian/physical), and data-based knowledge (rainfall, water levels).
  - Produced two bespoke models for Ryedale (Bunding) and Uckfield (Overflow), focusing on local interventions and downstream effects.
- Work Package 3: Competency Groups (CGs)
  - Experimental, radical interdisciplinarity involving 5–6 university members and 5–8 local members per group.
  - Bi-monthly hands-on modelling sessions, field visits, video/audio documentation, and a password-protected materials repository and group blog.
  - Two CGs: Ryedale (Pickering) 2007–2008; Uckfield (Sussex) 2008–2009.
  - Aims: interrogate expert knowledge claims, allow locals to test alternative framing, and produce a collective envoy to influence public debate and policy.
- Work Package 4: Public resource and transfer
  - A long-term web resource (Prezi-based) to enable others to adopt CG methods and interrogate environmental knowledge controversies.
  - Includes materials on knowledge controversies, doing science differently, Environmental Competency Groups, and a project archive.
  - Trialed with scientists in climate/ecosystem management contexts to compare controversy dynamics with flood risk.

## The Competency Group Appraisal and Ethos

- CGs institutionalise a reflexive, participatory research ethics that treats participants as individuals rather than representatives.
- Emphasise speak-from-experience, openness to disagreements, and learning together.
- Artefacts (maps, photos, video, policy documents, models) mediate knowledge claims, enabling “slowing down” of reasoning and making expert practices legible and contestable.
- The CGs produce a collective envoy (the bund-model) to travel beyond the group and influence policy/public discourse.

## Case Study Highlights

- Ryedale / Pickering: Flood controversy following EA’s shelved flood defence scheme; Babtie (2003) report favored local flood defences as the only viable option, which faced local aesthetic and effectiveness objections.
- The CG in Ryedale developed the bund-model (upstream small bunds) as a potential upstream storage solution, challenging the EA/consultant framing.
- Uckfield: CG exploration led to the Overflow model, testing multiple small riparian interventions (CRIMs) and capturing uncertainty via Monte Carlo and forward-only optimisation to identify positive interventions and potential synergies.
- The bund-model served as a public envoy: a Civic Centre exhibition (public walk-through posters, interactive modelling, videos) that attracted local media and officials, shifting the controversy’s terms and enabling a broader public discourse about upstream storage and whole-catchment management.
- Publications and dissemination: CGs and RFRG generated a portfolio of papers, reports, and media coverage; data and modelling scripts archived with ESRC; publicity helped seed a national demonstration project and influence EA/Defra engagements.

## Modelling Approaches and Data

- Knowledge-theoretic modelling contrasts with traditional data- or model-driven approaches by integrating experiential, theoretical, and data-derived knowledge.
- Bunding model (Ryedale):
  - Assumes catchment near saturation during extreme floods; models rainfall routing and bund storage with adjustable outlets to maximize low- to mid-flow release and store water during high-flow events.
  - Outputs time-series comparisons of protected vs. unprotected flows at a town inlet.
  - Validated with downstream 2D hydraulic modelling in a Defra-led project.
- Overflow model (Uckfield):
  - Handles many small interventions and their interactions; uses a mix of static and dynamic analyses to approximate flow paths and transit times.
  - Calibrated using measured flows; supports rapid uncertainty analysis via Monte Carlo sampling and multiple steady-state rainfall scenarios.
  - Enables testing of upstream storage, debris dams, riparian planting, hedgerows, re-meandering, channel roughening, etc.
- The models are bespoke to each location (not transferable as-is) but illustrate how co-produced knowledge shapes model structure and objectives.

## Public Engagement, Policy Impact, and Transfer

- The CGs’ public-facing envoy (bund-model) helped reframe the controversy and attracted official attention, including Defra funding and EA support for a pilot upstream storage project.
- Environment Agency acknowledgements shifted from a tacit acceptance of a flood wall to openness to “whole catchment” approaches incorporating local knowledge.
- The bund-model and CGs contributed to broader conversations about redistributing expertise and creating hybrid forums that bring together scientists, local residents, and policymakers.
- The project yielded a notable legacy in Pickering (bunds demonstration trajectory) and in Uckfield (further development of Overflow and integration with EA processes).

## Data Archiving, Publications, and Knowledge Transfer

- Data sets (interviews, model scripts) archived with ESRC Data Archive.
- Publications include multiple papers across science studies, hydrology, geography, and policy, with ongoing work and further papers in preparation.
- A civic web resource (Prezi-based) and policy/practice notes to help others adopt CGs and knowledge-controversy approaches in different environmental domains.

## Future Research Priorities

- Develop conceptual tools to treat uncertainties in robust scientific practice as legitimate in public discourse.
- Extend knowledge-theoretic modelling to other environmental science fields to improve model construction and accessibility.
- Expand the CG methodology to enable wider experimentation by civic and scientific communities facing other knowledge controversies.

## Conclusions and Implications

- Public science must be more than public participation; it requires new experimental practices that slow down and redistribute expertise.
- Controversies can be productive in creating new knowledge polities and publics when supported by mechanisms like CGs and envoy models (e.g., bund-model).
- The Pickering and Ryedale experience demonstrates how a carefully designed, collaborative, artefact-mediated approach can alter policy trajectories toward more inclusive, whole-catchment flood risk management and serve as a model for other diffuse environmental management challenges.

## Notable Outcomes and Works

- Demonstration project: upstream storage with bunds progressed in Pickering; substantial funding and political backing emerged.
- Uckfield: Overflow refined and calibrated, informing broader flood risk management discussions.
- Public engagement recognized: Beacons for Public Engagement case study; several conference presentations and Beacons-related dissemination.
