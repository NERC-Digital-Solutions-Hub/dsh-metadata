# Understanding Environmental Knowledge Controversies: the Case for Flood Risk Management , 2007-2010

- Aims and context
  - Investigates how flood risk knowledge claims are produced and contested in the UK, focusing on the role of mathematical and computer modelling in flood science and policy.
  - Explores how public controversies emerge around flood risk expertise in two localities (Ryedale/Pickering and Uckfield) and tests a novel interdisciplinary method called Competency Groups (CGs).
  - Develops new knowledge-theoretic modelling approaches responsive to local knowledge and explores transferability to other environmental risk fields.
  - Produces an interactive web resource to help scientists, policymakers, and citizens interrogate environmental knowledge controversies.

- Four interrelated aims ( Work Package structure in brief)
  - WP1: Analyze how flood risk knowledge claims are produced and inform policy; examine modelling practices, software, data, and contractual influences.
  - WP2: Develop knowledge-theoretic flood modelling co-produced with local publics through CGs.
  - WP3: Create and evaluate Competency Groups as a collaborative research methodology—natural and social scientists working with local residents.
  - WP4: Transfer lessons and provide a civic web resource to enable others to experiment with CGs and knowledge controversies.

- Methods and interdisciplinarity
  - Mixed methods: interviews with scientists and policy-makers, ethnography of modelling practice, archival research, and public engagement with CGs.
  - CGs (two cases: Ryedale Pickering and Uckfield) bring together university modellers and local residents to interrogate expert knowledge and test alternatives using artefacts (maps, models, photos, videos).
  - Emphasises slowing down reasoning and redistributing expertise through collaborative artefacts and public-facing outputs.

- Key concepts for GIS professionals
  - Data and modelling are embedded in institutional context: standardisation of software and contractual arrangements shape flood risk practice.
  - Modelling is inherently uncertain and provisional; uncertainty is often not visible in policy outputs.
  - Co-produced, bespoke models reflect combinations of experiential, theoretical, and data-based knowledge, yielding place-specific solutions.
  - The CG approach foregrounds practical cognition (learning by doing) and the mediation of knowledge claims through artefacts.

- Competency Groups (CGs)
  - Composition: 5–6 university modellers and 5–8 local residents per group; bi-monthly meetings; supported by artefacts (maps, photographs, videos) and a password-protected web repository.
  - Six commitments guiding CGs:
    - Members speak as individuals, not as constituency representatives.
    - Speak from personal experience; avoid reliance on received wisdom.
    - Embrace diverse viewpoints; disagreements are generative.
    - Learn together about the problem and collaborative methods.
  - Goals:
    - Interrogate existing flood management knowledge claims.
    - Enable locals to trial alternative framing and interventions.
    - Produce a collective envoy (knowledge claims) to travel beyond the group and influence debate and policymaking.

- Case study: Pickering and Ryedale (Bunding)
  - Context: EA shelved a flood defence scheme; controversy centered on knowledge claims and public contestation around flood risk management.
  - Bunding model (bund-model): upstream storage using small bunds to hold back water during high flows.
  - CG process produced a distributed, land-based model (bunding) that routes rainfall, identifies bund locations, and provides time-series protection metrics for Pickering.
  - Public engagement: a Civic Centre exhibition (bund-model posters, interactive model, videos) attracted ~200 visitors and media coverage; demonstrated alternative upstream storage not considered by prior consultants.
  - Outcome: bund-model travelled beyond the group, influencing public discourse and local government planning; Defra-funded demonstration project later pursued; bund-model used to reframe engineering options.

- Case study: Uckfield (Overflow)
  - CG explored upstream storage limitations and expanded to a suite of small riparian interventions (CRIMs): debris dams, riparian woodland, hedgerows, re-meandering, etc.
  - Modelling challenges: computational efficiency due to many possible interventions; need to infer distributed data (channel geometry) for many locations.
  - Overflow model: a knowledge-theoretic, distributed model that tests many small interventions; uses static/dynamic analyses, flow time maps, and Monte Carlo and forward-only optimisation to identify beneficial interventions and their synergies.
  - Output: a practical framework to test catchment-wide land management measures and identify interventions with positive, negative, or neutral impacts under uncertainty.

- Modelling innovations and GIS relevance
  - Knowledge-theoretic modelling contrasts with traditional data/theory-driven approaches by incorporating experiential and local knowledge into model assumptions and goals.
  - Models developed with CGs are bespoke to locations (Ryedale and Uckfield) and can be tuned interactively by end-users.
  - Technical aspects include:
    - Case-specific modelling directions (bunding in Pickering; Overflow in Uckfield).
    - Use of topographic data, rainfall records, and simplified hydrology/hydraulics to create user-adjustable simulations.
    - Flow routing, rainfall input, discharge outputs, and the ability to visualize protective effects over time.
    - Dynamic approximation techniques (e.g., Monte Carlo sampling) to handle uncertainty efficiently.

- Data, standards, and governance implications
  - Flood modelling is driven by commercial consulting practices and governmental contracts; standardisation of tools (1D hydraulic packages such as ISIS, HEC-RAS, MIKE11) shapes what counts as credible knowledge.
  - Public-facing outputs often hide modelling uncertainties; the CG approach pushes for transparency and co-ownership of model assumptions.
  - The CG framework models the production, validation, and transfer of knowledge, highlighting data provenance, evidence, and reliability.

- Knowledge transfer, outputs, and legacy
  - WP4 produced a web resource (Prezi-based) and civic materials to document the CG methodology, environmental knowledge controversies, and project outputs.
  - Outputs include: a knowledge-controversies outline, public engagement notes, environmental competency group principles, and case studies for broader application.
  - Public dissemination included media coverage, exhibitions, and formal demonstrations; the Pickering example influenced subsequent funding and planning decisions.
  - The project archived data (interviews, model scripts) with ESRC; recognized as a case study in public engagement and interdisciplinary environmental science.

- Impacts, uptake, and transferability
  - The bund-model and Uckfield Overflow outputs informed real-world flood management thought and policy, demonstrating an alternative to a single “defence wall” approach.
  - The project contributed to a broader shift toward whole-catchment management and diversified expertise in flood risk management.
  - The web resource and CG methodology offer a template for applying environmental knowledge controversies and participatory modelling to other diffuse environmental issues (e.g., climate/ecosystems management).

- Implications for GIS specialists
  - Emphasises data integration across diverse sources (local knowledge, historical maps, monitoring data) and the need for transparent provenance and uncertainty handling.
  - Demonstrates the value of interactive, user-influenced GIS models that can be co-produced with non-experts to explore interventions and their outcomes.
  - Highlights episodic, location-specific modelling with bespoke parameters, rather than one-size-fits-all solutions; supports scenario testing, time-series outputs, and flow-path visualizations.
  - Encourages documenting model assumptions and validation processes to support trust and public engagement in GIS-driven policy discussions.

- Conclusions and future directions
  - Generating new publics and political avenues requires explicit, experimental redistribution of expertise and methods that slow down conventional expert reasoning.
  - Competency Groups offer a practical, transferable approach to conducting public science differently, with potential application beyond flooding to other diffuse environmental risks.
  - Future work includes refining knowledge-theoretic modelling, expanding CG adoption in other domains, and sustaining public-facing resources to enable ongoing experimentation with environmental knowledge controversies.
