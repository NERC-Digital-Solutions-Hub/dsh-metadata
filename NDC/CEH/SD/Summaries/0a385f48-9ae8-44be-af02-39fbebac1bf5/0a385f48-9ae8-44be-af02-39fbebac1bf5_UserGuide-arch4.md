# Understanding Environmental Knowledge Controversies: the Case for Flood Risk Management, 2007-2010 Hydrology Data User Guide

- A research project (Whatmore, Lane, and collaborators) exploring how flood risk science and policy are produced, standardized, and contested.
- Central idea: knowledge controversies can be constructive if new practices redistribute expertise and open up public participation in model development and decision-making.

## Core aims and approach

- Analyze how flood risk knowledge claims arise from mathematical/computer modelling and inform UK flood management.
- Examine two local controversies (Ryedale/Pickering and Uckfield) using Competency Groups (CGs) that mix scientists and local residents to scrutinize expert framings.
- Develop new knowledge-theoretic modelling approaches that co-produce models with affected publics.
- Transfer lessons to other environmental risk fields and provide an interactive web resource to help scientists, policymakers, and citizens interrogate knowledge controversies.

## Methods and the Competency Group methodology

- CGs combine natural and social scientists with local residents in areas with active flood risk debates.
- Activities include bi-monthly hands-on modelling sessions, field visits, transcripts, photo/video records, and a password-protected materials website.
- Aims of CGs:
  - Interrogate existing flood science claims and management practices.
  - Enable affected communities to test alternative framing and management options.
  - Produce a collectively sharable model and knowledge claims that travel beyond the group.
- Distinctive commitments of CGs:
  - Focus on knowledge practices (discursive and practical cognition).
  - Apprenticeship to the issue; open to diverse views.
  - Staging associative events; improvisational and emergent outcomes.
  - Generation of collective competences; redistribution of expertise.
  - Exercise of new publics; minority-led, rights to disagree with government/policy.
- Four key ethical/practice principles for CGs
  - Members participate as individuals, not as representatives.
  - Speak from personal experience, not only “received wisdom.”
  - Respect diverse views; disagreements are generative.
  - Learn together and transfer lessons.

## Modelling innovations and case studies

- Knowledge-theoretic modelling vs. traditional data/theory approaches:
  - Incorporates experiential, theoretical, and data-based knowledge. Models are co-produced through CG processes and are bespoke for each locale.
- Case 1: Bunding model (Pickering, Ryedale)
  - Upstream storage using bunds to hold back floodwater; interactive tool to test bund placements and storage capacity.
  - Focus on keeping outlet flows open during low/moderate flows and increasing storage during high flows.
  - Model validated against downstream 2D hydraulic testing; demonstrated potential to protect town by delaying floodwater.
- Case 2: Overflow model (Uckfield, Sussex)
  - Tested multiple small, riparian interventions (CRIMs) including debris dams, riparian woodland, hedgerows, and re-meandering.
  - Overflow integrates static and dynamic analyses to produce flow-time maps, enabling rapid uncertainty analyses via Monte Carlo and forward-only optimisation.
  - Supported testing of combinations and locations, with results showing context-dependent effects and potential synergies or conflicts among interventions.

## Knowledge governance, data management and outputs

- Data inputs and sources:
  - Rainfall records, river levels, topography (digital elevation data), and various hydraulic datasets.
- Modelling infrastructure:
  - Departure from conventional 1D hydrodynamic models (ISIS, HEC-RAS, MIKE11) toward knowledge-theoretic, distributed approaches co-produced with CGs.
  - Emphasis on model provenance, transparency, and the ability to test multiple interventions interactively.
- Data and dissemination:
  - Outputs included models, maps, photos, policy documents, and a long-term web resource (Prezi-based) to document controversies and CG methodology.
  - Public exhibitions (e.g., Bund-model exhibition in Pickering Civic Centre) to travel knowledge claims and engage local publics and media.
- Impact on practice:
  - Bunding and Overflow models informed demonstrations and, subsequently, a national demonstration project.
  - Environment Agency (EA) notices acknowledged the value of upstream storage and whole-catchment approaches; local publics gained a more active role in decision-making.

## Four work packages and key outcomes

- WP1: Environmental Knowledge Production and Controversy
  - Investigated how flood knowledge claims are produced, standardized, and contested; identified variability across academic, consultancy, and government contexts; highlighted how uncertainty is managed (or obscured) in policy contexts.
- WP2: MIR Science and Modelling (Knowledge-Theoretic Modelling)
  - Developed co-produced, place-specific models through CGs; showed that “bespoke” models perform best when informed by experiential, theoretical, and data sources; demonstrated the potential for new flood risk reduction strategies.
- WP3: New Forms of Interdisciplinary Working
  - Tested Competency Groups as a participatory modelling framework to redistribute expertise and slow down reasoning, enabling new public formations and policy influence.
- WP4: Transferring Lessons and Skills
  - Created a civic web resource to document and share CG methods, knowledge controversies, and opportunities for public science to influence policy; explored applicability to other diffuse environmental issues and climate/ecosystem contexts.

## Implications for Data Leaders

- Data as a co-produced asset:
  - Recognize data are not just inputs but integral to knowledge claims; involve stakeholders early to shape data collection, definitions, and model goals.
- Data provenance, metadata, and discoverability:
  - Document experiential and collaborative inputs alongside traditional data; ensure metadata captures model assumptions, uncertainty, and negotiation history.
- Co-ownership and governance:
  - Embrace stakeholder involvement in data governance, including model development, validation, and interpretation; establish transparent ethics reflecting all participants.
- Managing uncertainty and transparency:
  - Prevent “certitude” from overshadowing uncertainties; explicitly communicate limitations and probabilistic outcomes to decision-makers and the public.
- Data infrastructure and accessibility:
  - Build collaborative platforms (such as CG websites and public exhibitions) to host data, models, and narratives; ensure accessible interfaces for non-experts to test interventions.
- Reproducibility and transferability:
  - While CG-based models are locally tailored, document processes that enable adaptation to other contexts; provide templates and guidelines for participatory modelling approaches.

## Practical takeaways for Data Leaders

- Foster public-involved data product development to improve relevance and uptake of analytics.
- Use artefacts (maps, models, visualizations) as mediators to elicit stakeholder feedback and modify data-driven recommendations.
- Create open, traceable workflows that capture how knowledge claims were produced, challenged, and revised.
- Support iterative, user-centered data product development with feedback loops from affected communities and policy teams.
- Invest in a public-facing knowledge repository or web resource to disseminate methodology, data, and findings beyond academic outputs.

## Public engagement, legitimacy, and impact

- The CGs and bund-model reframed the flood controversy by slowing down expert reasoning and demonstrating alternative interventions.
- Public exhibitions and media engagement amplified the legitimacy and reach of CG results, influencing local policy discussions and funding decisions.
- The approach exemplifies “majoritarian” publics being complemented by minority-led and non-human elements (artefacts, models) in shaping policy.

## Conclusions and future directions

- Controversies can stimulate new forms of public engagement and policy-relevant science when accompanied by experimental, minoritarian research practices that redistribute expertise.
- The bund-model demonstrated how specific artefacts can travel beyond initial groups to influence policy, funding, and public discourse.
- Recommended future work:
  - Further develop knowledge-controversy theory and its application to other environmental risks.
  - Extend knowledge-theoretic modelling to additional domains.
  - Expand the Competency Group framework for broader civic and scientific participation.

## Outputs, dissemination, and legacy

- Publications across science studies, hydrological science, geography, policy, and social theory.
- Data and interviews archived with ESRC data repositories.
- Results informed national demonstrations and local policy discussions; the Pickering upstream storage scheme and broader “whole catchment” approaches received public and governmental attention.
- The project promoted a shift toward public experimentation in science and an expanded repertoire of public engagement practices for data-led environmental decision-making.

## Future research priorities (summary)

- Frame environmental knowledge controversies as opportunities to integrate uncertainty into public discourse and decision-making.
- Advance knowledge-theoretic modelling for diverse environmental fields to improve model specificity and accessibility.
- Broaden adoption of Competency Groups to other areas of environmental science for public-facing, data-informed governance.
