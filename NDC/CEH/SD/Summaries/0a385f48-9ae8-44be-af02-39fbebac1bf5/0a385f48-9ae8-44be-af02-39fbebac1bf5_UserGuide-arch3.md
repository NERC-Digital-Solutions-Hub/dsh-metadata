# Understanding Environmental Knowledge Controversies: the Case for Flood Risk Management , 2007-2010 Hydrology Data USER GUIDE Paper accepted for publication by Economy and Society

- Aims and purpose
  - Examine how flood risk knowledge claims are produced and become embedded in policy and practice.
  - Analyze why flood risk expertise becomes publicly controversial in local contexts.
  - Develop a knowledge-theoretic modelling approach that incorporates local knowledge alongside scientific data.
  - Create an interactive web resource to help scientists, policymakers, and citizens interrogate environmental knowledge controversies.
  - Identify lessons transferable to other environmental risk management contexts.

- Core concepts and theoretical framing
  - Knowledge controversies can be generative, slowing down conventional decision-making and redistributing expertise.
  - Stengers’ experimental constructivism: public engagement should slow reasoning and co-create new knowledge polities.
  - Emphasis on “intermediate stages” of knowledge production (models, data, artefacts) as objects that mediate understanding.
  - Publics emerge around problems in dynamic, hybrid forums rather than as fixed stakeholder groups.

- Methodological approach (Work Packages)
  - Work Package 1: Flood knowledge production and policy interface
    - Interviews with scientists, consultants, and policymakers; ethnography of modelling practice; archival study of flood science history.
    - Investigates how modelling practices are contextual, standardised, and contractualised, shaping policy outputs.
  - Work Package 2: Knowledge-theoretic modelling
    - Co-produced, location-specific models developed with CG input (two case sites: Pickering (Ryedale) and Uckfield (Sussex)).
    - Integrates experiential (local), theoretical (Newtonian/physical reasoning), and data-based knowledge.
  - Work Package 3: Competency Groups (CGs)
    - Radical interdisciplinary method pairing university scientists with local residents.
    - Group structure: about 5-6 university members and 5-8 local members; bi-monthly hands-on modelling sessions; use of artefacts (maps, photos, video, policy documents).
    - Six governing commitments: act as individuals, speak from experience, respect differing viewpoints, learn together, slow down reasoning, transfer lessons.
  - Work Package 4: Public-facing knowledge resource
    - A long-term web resource (Prezi-based) to share knowledge controversies, CG method, and case materials.
    - Demonstrates how to apply the CG approach to other environmental management fields.

- Key findings and insights
  - Modelling knowledge claims are uncertain and provisional, yet widely presented as certainties due to software standardisation and contractual practices.
  - The Environment Agency (EA) acts as the public face of flood risk expertise; uncertainties are often buffered or obscured in policy outputs.
  - Different modelling cultures (academic vs. consultancy) and contractual regimes heavily influence model choices and outcomes.
  - CGs reveal that knowledge is produced through a combination of experiential, theoretical, and data-based sources negotiated in group settings.
  - The bund-model (upstream storage via small bunds) and the Overflow model (testing many small interventions) exemplify knowledge-theoretic modelling co-produced with locals.
  - Upstream storage and CRIMs (catchment riparian interventions) can be optimized through interactive, distributed modelling, with uncertainty incorporated via Monte Carlo and forward-heuristic approaches.
  - Public exhibitions and media coverage of CG outputs helped move controversy from funding battles to consider “whole catchment” approaches and broader dissemination of knowledge claims.

- The bund-model and Overflow: distilled concepts
  - Bunding (Pickering):
    - Co-produced model routing rainfall to simulate upstream bunds that create temporary storage behind barriers to reduce downstream flood peaks.
    - Interactive tool allows placement and sizing of bunds; aims to maximize discharge through outlets to avoid storage under low flows but store water under high-flow events.
    - Validated in downstream tests with a two-dimensional hydraulic model; used to advocate upstream storage as a feasible intervention.
  - Overflow (Uckfield):
    - Tests a suite of small, catchment-scale interventions (CRIMs) via a distributed, time- and flow-aware modelling approach.
    - Handles computational efficiency and data constraints through static and dynamic analyses; generates flow-time maps and discharge estimates.
    - Enables rapid uncertainty-aware evaluation of many intervention scenarios and their interactions; supports both forward screening and Monte Carlo optimization.

- Public engagement, governance, and data sharing
  - CGs reframe expert knowledge in public discussions, creating new publics around flood risk and enabling non-experts to participate meaningfully.
  - The Ryedale Flood Research Group (RFRG) produced an envoy (the bund-model) that travelled beyond the group to influence public debate and policy discussions.
  - Public events (e.g., Civic Centre exhibition) and media coverage broadened the reach of CGs, attracting institutional attention and funding opportunities.
  - Demonstration project funding (Defra) followed in Pickering, illustrating redistribution of expertise and adoption of a whole-catchment approach.
  - Data and outputs were archived with ESRC; outputs included policy notes, models, interviews, and project materials to support transparency and reuse.
  - The approach highlights that public engagement must be integrated from early scoping through to model implementation, not merely as a communications add-on.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Monitoring should accommodate and expose modelling uncertainty rather than masking it behind definitive outputs.
  - Data governance must balance openness with practical and ethical constraints; ensure provenance, metadata quality, and traceability of datasets and models.
  - Publicly explainable models and artefacts (e.g., bund-model) can serve as monitoring and governance tools to engage stakeholders and build legitimacy.
  - Co-produced models that embed experiential local knowledge enhance relevance and acceptance of monitoring results.
  - Early-stage stakeholder involvement in setting objectives and parameters improves the robustness and legitimacy of monitoring frameworks.

- Transferability and future directions
  - The web-based civic resource and CG methodology offer a blueprint for applying environmental knowledge controversies to other diffuse risk problems (ecosystems, climate change).
  - Future work includes expanding knowledge-theoretic modelling to other environmental domains, refining CG ethics and governance, and enabling wider adoption of the approach.

- Outcomes, impact, and legacy
  - Demonstration projects and national publicity acknowledged the value of redistributing expertise between scientists and local communities.
  - The Pickering bund-model and Uckfield Overflow outputs influenced policy discussions toward whole catchment management and public engagement.
  - The project established a framework for public-facing, co-produced science and created a migratable methodology for other diffuse environmental issues.
  - Scholarly output and public engagement activities contributed to a lasting case study in public science and environmental knowledge controversies.
