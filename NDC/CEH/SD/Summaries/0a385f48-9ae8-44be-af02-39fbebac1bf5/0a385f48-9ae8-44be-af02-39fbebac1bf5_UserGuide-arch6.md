# Understanding Environmental Knowledge Controversies: the Case for Flood Risk Management , 2007-2010

- Focus: A study on how flood risk knowledge is produced, contested, and used in policy, and how new collaborative methods can re-distribute expertise and open up democratic engagement with environmental modelling.
- Context: Flood events trigger scrutiny of expert knowledge claims in flood risk management and highlight tensions between scientific claim making, policy pragmatics, and public experience.

## Aims and scope

- Analyze how flood risk knowledge claims are produced by modelling practices and how they inform UK flood policy.
- Investigate public controversy in two localities (Ryedale/Pickering and Uckfield) and test Competency Groups (CGs) as a method to interrogate expert framings.
- Develop knowledge-theoretic modelling approaches that integrate local experiential knowledge with theory and data to improve flood risk forecasts.
- Transfer lessons to other environmental risks and provide an interactive web resource to help scientists, policymakers, and citizens interrogate environmental knowledge controversies.

## Methods and Work Packages (WPs)

- WP1: Empirical study of flood science practices, data and policy interfaces.
  - Interviews with scientists and policymakers; ethnography with modelers; archival research on historical flood science.
- WP2: Knowledge-theoretic modelling.
  - Co-produced models in two locations, integrating experiential, theoretical, and data-based knowledge; development of minimum-information models for rural land management effects on flood risk.
- WP3: Competency Groups (CGs) as a participatory research method.
  - Two CGs (Ryedale Pickering; Uckfield) with university and local members; bi-monthly hands-on modelling sessions; artefacts (maps, photos, video) used to mediate knowledge claims.
  - Goals: interrogate expert knowledge, enable alternative problem framings, produce a collective envoy to move public debate and policy.
- WP4: Knowledge transfer and public engagement via a web resource.
  - Interactive Prezi-based archive of methodologies, case studies, and tools to enable others to trial CGs; demonstrations with scientists and practitioners; long-term online resources.

## Data and modelling: how knowledge is produced and used

- Modelling as the engine of flood risk management, with outputs presented as certain or final in policy contexts, obscuring uncertainties.
- Three knowledge sources used in each model:
  - Experiential: local knowledge and firsthand experiences.
  - Theoretical: Newtonian views and physical understanding of hydrology/hydraulics.
  - Data-based: rainfall, water level records, and other empirical data.
- Data challenges: patchy data, multiple data formats, and integration across systems; reliance on data and software standardization in professional practice.

## Key modelling innovations and data products

- Bunding model (Pickering, Bunding Case)
  - Purpose: test upstream storage via small bunds to hold back floodwater; accounts for storage, outlet flows, and downstream protection duration.
  - Data inputs: rainfall, topography, and observed catchment behavior; interactive bund placement to simulate storage effects.
  - Outputs: time-series of flow protection and duration, compared against unprotected scenarios; validated against downstream two-dimensional hydraulic modelling.
- Overflow model (Uckfield Case)
  - Purpose: test numerous small catchment interventions (CRIMs) with a focus on distributed storage and flow routing.
  - Data handling: static and dynamic analyses; flow time maps; use of Manning’s equation for depth/velocity; Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty and optimization.
  - Outputs: intervention classifications (positive/neutral/negative); two optimisation schemes (forward-only and Monte Carlo) to identify effective, synergistic measures.
- Co-produced, knowledge-theoretic modelling
  - Integrates experiential, theoretical, and data-based knowledge within CG sessions; models are bespoke to each location and reflect negotiated assumptions and goals.
  - Emphasizes that all modelling contains theoretical content and that models are “performed” through collaborative practice.

## Competency Groups as a data-supported public engagement method

- Structure: 5–6 university modellers with 5–8 local residents, plus facilitators and media support; bi-monthly modelling sessions, field visits, and media artefacts.
- Artefacts: maps, photos, policy documents, transcripts, video and audio recordings, group blogs, password-protected resource depositories.
- Principles guiding CGs:
  - Participants speak from personal experience; act as individuals, not representatives.
  - Open to diverse viewpoints; disagreements are generative.
  - Mutual learning; lessons transferable.
- Outcomes: CGs enable slowing down of reasoning, objectify knowledge claims through artefacts, and foster a new public discourse around flood risk management.

## Case studies: Ryedale Pickering and Uckfield

- Pickering (Ryedale):
  - Background controversy over a planned flood wall after the 2000 and 2007 floods; EA withdrew funding for the wall.
  - CG developed the bund-model as an upstream storage solution, engaging public and media; created an envoy (RFRG) to translate group knowledge into public discourse.
  - The CG’s public exhibition in Pickering Civic Centre attracted broad local attention, shifting the controversy toward upstream storage and a broader “whole catchment” management approach.
- Uckfield (Sussex):
  - CG explored upstream storage limits and expanded to a suite of interventions (CRIMs) beyond bunds.
  - Overflow model used to test numerous small interventions; engaged EA and Defra in demonstration project funding.
  - Development of a broader collaborative approach linking academic researchers, local knowledge, and policy actors.

## Outputs, knowledge transfer, and impacts

- Public-facing and policy-relevant outputs:
  - Bund-model and Overflow modelling approaches published and integrated into practice; demonstration projects funded by Defra; local government support for upstream storage.
  - Public exhibitions and media coverage highlighting the value of co-produced knowledge and “redistribution of expertise.”
  - Web-resource and policy/practice notes to enable replication and adaptation in other contexts.
- Data archiving and accessibility:
  - Interviews, model scripts, and project outputs archived with ESRC data resources.
- Professional and public impact:
  - Beacons for Public Engagement case study; recognition by RCUK; ongoing local policy uptake and funding for upstream storage solutions.
  - The bund-model and CG approach helped reframe flood risk management as a  whole-catchment, data-informed public process.

## Takeaways for data-oriented practice

- Data is not just inputs; it shapes problem framing, model assumptions, and public legitimacy.
- Co-producing data and models with affected publics can yield context-specific, defensible, and open-ended solutions that policy-makers may adopt.
- Visual and interactive artefacts (maps, models, Prezi-based resources) are powerful mediators that help diverse publics understand and engage with complex data-driven claims.
- Transparency around data sources, uncertainties, and modelling choices is essential to avoid “final form” knowledge claims in policy contexts.
- Data governance and ethics in participatory modelling require clear principles: individual participation, experiential knowledge, openness to disagreement, and transferable learning.
- Public-facing data products can travel beyond original sites to influence policy, funding decisions, and new forms of environmental governance.

## Future directions

- Further develop conceptual approaches to treating knowledge controversies as opportunities to include uncertainties in public discourse and decision-making.
- Expand knowledge-theoretic modelling to other environmental science fields for improved model specificity and accessibility.
- Extend Competency Group methodology to other diffuse environmental management challenges and institutional contexts, supported by a robust web-resource for practitioners.
