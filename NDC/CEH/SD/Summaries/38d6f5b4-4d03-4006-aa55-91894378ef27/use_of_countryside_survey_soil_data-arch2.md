# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Sampling design
- Soils were sampled in Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, 2007 and 2019.
- 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 sampled soils from all 591 CS squares, though not all measurements were made on every sample.
- Power analyses determined the number of samples needed to detect significant change (see Emmett et al. 2008).
- A pilot survey occurred in 2018; 2019 marked the start of a rolling survey aiming to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.

## Sample location
- Soils are collected from CS X-plots, with 5 X-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates (they may cover very different land uses, soil types, etc.).
- Over time, X-plots may be relocated due to plot destruction, access denial, or relocation uncertainty.
- Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1: square 2, repeat plot 1).
- Samples with the same identifier originate from the same location, though exact sampling positions shift about 2–3 m within a 2 m × 2 m permanently marked plot corner.

## Sampling
- Soils are collected from the top 15 cm of the profile (8 cm for the invertebrate sample).
- 1998/2007 rolling survey used soil cores hammered into the soil and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit with sampling from the top 15 cm from the pit side.
- Full 15-cm cores were not always possible due to stones or shallow soils.
- Core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken by lab staff in 2007 for two of the four cores sampled (black cores and N mineralization cores).
- Rolling CS survey adopted the core method consistently.

## Measurements
- In 1978, laboratory measurements were limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- In CS1990, some soil mapping was conducted.
- From 1998, 2007, and the CS rolling survey (2018/2019–2023), multiple cores per X-plot were taken; different cores had different measurements.
- No chemical analyses are performed by soil horizons; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
- Bulk density was measured in 2007 and in 2018/19–2023, but not using ISO bulk density methods (which would require a whole core).

## Statistical analysis
- Analyses should consider CS’s statistical structure; ignoring land class structure can yield stock and change estimates rather than national estimates weighted by land classes.
- Bootstrapping is not always used in soils analyses.
- A mixed-model approach is recommended, with the square included as a random factor to account for up to five X-plots per CS square.
- Design-based approaches (dispersed observations) can increase overall precision and regional coverage when a fully spatially explicit model is not the focus.
- The CS structure is not designed for detailed spatial analysis of land class, so users are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and to review CS publications available on the CS website.

## Practical considerations for analysts
- When using CS soils data, consult prior publications and the CS website for lineage and methodology context.
- Consider including land class structure in analyses to obtain national estimates of stock and change.
- Use mixed-models with square as a random effect to reflect the hierarchical sampling design.
- Be aware that multiple cores per X-plot exist, with potential variation in measurements across cores.
