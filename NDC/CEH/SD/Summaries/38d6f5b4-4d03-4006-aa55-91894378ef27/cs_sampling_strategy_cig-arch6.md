# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Overview
- Documents the development of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) from 1978 to 2007.
- Describes why stratified, representative sampling is essential and how Land Classification provides the strata.
- Explains how field squares are selected, how data are used to produce national estimates, and how classification changes affect comparability over time.
- Emphasises the link between data collection, classification schemes, and policy-relevant outputs (e.g., habitat estimates, land-use status).

## Core concepts: stratification, sampling units, and data products
- Stratified sampling using the ITE Land Classification to ensure all land types are represented.
- Primary sampling unit: 1 km x 1 km squares; sampling rate per Land Class is determined to balance precision and resources.
- Outputs include habitat area estimates, land-use status, and other ecological features derived from field surveys.

## Chronological milestones and methodological evolution

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
- Developed the ITE Land Classification with Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to create 32 land classes.
- Used centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid (1228 squares classified; plus 4 surrounding squares per centre) for a total of 6039 km squares classified.
- Sampling: 8 squares per Land Class (total 256 squares) surveyed in 1 km squares.
- National estimates: calculated as mean habitat area per square within each Land Class, multiplied by the Land Class area.

### 1984 – Second Field Survey
- Expanded sampling to 12 squares per Land Class (total 384).
- Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- Began publishing change statistics between 1978 and 1984.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and 3rd Field Survey
- Revised classification to cover every GB 1 km square (All Squares Land Classification).
- Field survey: 508 squares surveyed.
- Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; repeated measurements from 1984 survey.
- Highlights: some squares changed class; national estimates updated accordingly.

### 1990–2000 – Developments in Land Classification and CS2000 Planning
- Recognition that every square needed to be classified; tested multiple multivariate approaches.
- Best replacement achieved with a 62% correspondence to the original 1990 classes; most mismatches fell into neighboring classes.
- Consequence: distortions in class representation; prompted modifications to sampling for national estimates and to support policy needs.
- CS2000 introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) and adjustments to ensure adequate representation of new classes.
- Changes included subdivision of Land Classes into country-unit versions, class aggregation where necessary, and additional squares to balance representation.
- Included an uplands module to improve accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

### 2007 – Wales-focused adjustments (CS2007)
- With devolution, Wales required Wales-only habitat reporting.
- Implemented country-unit sub-divisions for select classes (creating 5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
- Expanded Wales sampling by 43 additional squares (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class); England adjustments made to maintain overall balance.
- England retained most classes, though two English classes (5e, 15e) ended with 4 squares per class.
- Revised Land Classification maps implemented for England with Wales and Scotland; Wales became the most intensively sampled country unit.

## National estimates and cross-survey consistency

- Note on national estimates: Changing the basic Land Classification used for estimation affects the consistency of stock estimates across surveys.
- Preference for using the latest classification for country-specific estimates; use of the original 1990 classification can be more consistent across surveys.
- Table 4 presents the number of squares per class under the original (1990) Land Classification across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, illustrating how sample sizes per class have evolved with classification changes.

## Outputs and data-use implications

- Outputs enable policy-relevant habitat and land-use statistics at national and country levels (England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-specific reporting).
- Data products rely on:
  - Stratified sampling framed by Land Classes.
  - Consistent methodology for estimating areas per habitat type from the per-square data.
  - Documentation of how classification changes influence estimates and comparability.
- For data support: be aware of differences in sample sizes by class and country across survey years, due to classification evolution and country-specific reporting needs.

## Data considerations for modern use and comparability
- When comparing habitat estimates across CS rounds, consider the Land Classification version used (original vs. latest).
- For England and Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only reporting, be mindful of country-unit class subdivisions and the associated sampling rates.
- The upland module (CS2000) enhances precision for upland habitats in England and Wales.
