# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. Applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

- Partners and funding: 2018/2019-2024 rolling program funded by NERC (NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme. Original CS partners include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

- Why locations are confidential: To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, protecting the survey’s scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.

- Circumstances for release and precision levels:
  - Four-digit grid references (approximate location): may be released under licence to show which 10 km x 10 km grid square a CS square falls in.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise location): only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must be requested via UKCEH processing to avoid direct release, with strong justification that competing IP/data is as confidential as CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality; released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
  - In all cases, releases must not enable locating CS squares or identifying landowners.

- Specific conditions of release:
  - Licences must maintain data confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate needs.
  - Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end.
  - No data may be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; not used to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
  - Potential licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP where applicable.
  - Four-digit releases have a less stringent IP confidentiality requirement than six-digit releases; both prohibit attempts to derive precise locations.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - UKCEH acts on behalf of NERC to decide on exceptional releases and issue licences; signatories must be senior officials from licensee organisations.
  - If approval is denied, decisions follow the Act and Regulations; annual reporting to CS partners summarises applications and decision grounds.
  - UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand to CS partners; other organisations’ requests handled case-by-case.
  - Partnerships are encouraged to consult UKCEH before committing to CS location data use; UKCEH involvement is optional and may be negotiated per case.

- Access process for analysts:
  - Contact UKCEH for guidance and potential pre-processing analysis without releasing precise locations.
  - If licensed, comply with strict confidentiality, security, and destruction requirements; ensure licensing period boundaries and project scope are honored.
  - Expect potential collaboration or paid support for data handling and preprocessing as negotiated.
