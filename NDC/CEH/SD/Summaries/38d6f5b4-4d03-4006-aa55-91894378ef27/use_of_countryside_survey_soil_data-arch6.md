# Sampling design

## Overview
- Documents the Countryside Survey soils sampling design across years (1978, 1998, 2007, 2019 rolling survey) and the statistical rationale (power analyses) to detect significant change.
- 2019 rolling survey aims to sample ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating; pilot in 2018.

## Sampling framework and timeline
- Years and scope: 1978 and 1998 sampled the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to 591 squares with complete coverage for some measurements; rolling survey begins in 2019.
- Power analyses (Emmett et al. 2008) guide the number of samples needed to detect change.
- Rolling phase initiated to establish ongoing measurement cadence and trend understanding.

## Sample locations and identifiers
- Location system: soils sampled from CS X-plots, five X-plots per CS square; X-plots are not replicates due to different land uses/types.
- Relocation and tracking: plots may be relocated if destroyed or access denied; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1: square 2, repeat plot 1).
- Location accuracy: samples from the same unique identifier come from the same location but may be about 2–3 m apart within a 2 m x 2 m plot.

## Sampling procedures
- Depth and method: soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples) using soil cores hammered into the ground; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Core handling: multiple cores per X-plot in 1998, 2007, and 2018/19–2023; core measurements vary by plot and year.
- Practical notes: full 15 cm sampling sometimes impeded by stones or shallow soils; 2007 included core photographs and detailed measurements for select cores.

## Measurements and lab analyses
- 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
- 1998, 2007, 2018/19–2023: multiple cores per X-plot; measurements differ by core; no horizon-specific chemical analyses; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
- Bulk density: measured in 2007 and 2018/19–2023 (not via ISO whole-core method).
- Documentation: full methods and implications discussed in Emmett et al. 2008.

## Statistical design and data interpretation
- Consideration of land class structure: results can reflect raw stock/change or, when land classes are weighted, national estimates.
- Modeling approach: mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple X-plots per square; bootstrap methods not always applied.
- Sampling design implications: dispersed observations can increase regional precision/coverage; only one core per location in some years.
- Guidance: users should consult UKCEH prior to analysis and review published CS outputs available on the CS website.

## Data quality, limitations, and recommendations
- Limitations: non-replicate X-plots within squares; relocations can affect longitudinal consistency; not all measurements available for every sample.
- Recommendations: account for spatial structure in analyses; be mindful of data gaps and ensure appropriate weighting or modeling; refer to the CS methodological references for context.
