# THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

- Overview
  - Presents the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007 and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification that underpin it.
  - Emphasises that the current methodology is linked to 30 years of development and remains inseparable from its predecessors.
  - Explains the purpose: to create a representative, stratified sampling system for national ecological and land-use estimation across Great Britain with potential cross-network applicability.

- Beginning and key concepts
  - Stratified random sampling is used to avoid bias and ensure representation across diverse ecological contexts.
  - ITE Land Classification was created to carve GB land into discrete strata (32 original classes) based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to guide sampling.
  - Early method used, due to computing limits, a center-square approach: classify 1 km squares by ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) based on environmental data for 1228 center squares; include surrounding four squares to form a broader 6040-square framework.
  - Field surveys began with 8 samples per Land Class (256 total) in CS1978, expanding to 12 per class in CS1984.

- Land Classification development and rationale
  - The ITE Land Classification started with a 1 km square framework and evolved to describe environmental attributes across GB, enabling national and regional estimates.
  - By 1990 (CS1990), the classification was revised to incorporate data from all GB squares (all-squares approach) with some reclassification of squares; the Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to better reflect regional variation.
  - The change to all-squares classification initially caused representational distortions for some classes, prompting adjustments in sampling distribution for subsequent surveys.

- Progression through Countryside Surveys
  - CS1984 (second field survey): sampling increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (384 total) to improve estimates.
  - CS1990 (third field survey): implemented an all-squares Land Classification; 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats from CS1978; linked to first Land Cover Map using satellite data.
  - CS2000 (fifth field survey): further development of Land Classification to enable Scotland and England/Wales separate reporting; introduced country-unit strata (40 strata total after subdivision and aggregation); added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; included an uplands module for better accuracy of upland habitat estimates; Wales received additional sampling due to devolved policy needs.
  - CS2007 (sixth field survey): Wales-specific reporting required further Welsh country-unit subdivisions and 43 additional Welsh squares; class sub-divisions created to reflect England-Wales country units (five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); England did not receive equivalent increases, though precision impact was considered acceptable; upland habitat emphasis continued for improved estimates.

- Country reporting and sampling framework adjustments
  - Separate country estimates became a priority post-devolution: England with Wales and Scotland needed distinct reporting units.
  - Land Classes were subdivided into country-unit versions (England&Wales, Scotland) creating additional strata (up to 45 total).
  - Where a country had very few squares in a class, those were aggregated with a similar class within that country to maintain representation.
  - Wales received targeted expansion with Welsh-class subdivisions and additional squares to ensure robust Wales-only estimates.
  - Isle of Man squares were removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with new England squares to maintain country-specific balance.

- Uplands module and data outputs
  - A dedicated uplands module added in CS2000/CS2007 funded to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - Output structure includes national estimates by class, cross-country breakdowns, and accompanying maps (class maps and sample square locations).

- Data structure, quality, and comparability considerations
  - The 2006 scoping study notes that changing the underlying Land Classification for national estimates affects consistency across surveys; two approaches exist: use the latest country-specific classifications or maintain a uniform original classification for cross-survey consistency.
  - For national estimates, the preferred approach is to use the latest classification per survey, while cross-survey comparability may rely on the original 1990 Land Classification for consistency.
  - Changes in classification can shift the distribution of sample representation; the methodology documents how to interpret and adjust national estimates accordingly.

- Methodology details and outputs
  - Sampling numbers and strata distribution are documented for each survey (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) with detailed tables and maps illustrating the land-class distributions and sample locations.
  - Tables summarize the number of squares per class and per country, along with sampling rates and the total GB coverage.
  - Figures provide maps of original and revised Land Classifications, as well as sample-square distributions across the UK.

- Implications for Data Leaders (data strategy takeaways)
  - The importance of a robust, topic-relevant stratification system to support representative sampling and reliable national estimates.
  - Necessity of version control and careful documentation of Land Classification changes to enable comparability over time and across country units.
  - Need to plan for country-specific reporting needs (England, Wales, Scotland) and to allocate additional samples where classifications diverge by country to maintain precision.
  - Recognition of the uplands module as a targeted data collection expansion to improve precision in under-sampled or high-importance areas.
  - Awareness of data governance challenges such as data integrity, metadata quality, and the potential impact of evolving classifications on cross-year analyses.
  - The value of linking field data to satellite-derived land-cover information and other ancillary data to enrich analyses and improve national-scale estimates.
