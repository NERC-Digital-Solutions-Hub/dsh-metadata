# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Document the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007, detailing how the ITE Land Classification evolved and how sampling frames were constructed to enable robust national and country-specific estimates over time.

## Key methodological concepts

- Stratified sampling to ensure representative coverage across ecological land types.
- ITE Land Classification as the core stratification framework; classes defined by environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate).
- Avoidance of bias by combining objective stratification with random sampling within strata.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification

- Origin (1970s): Conceptualized to classify land areas similar to vegetation quadrats but at larger scales (1 km squares); used environmental attributes to create land classes.
- Initial implementation (late 1970s): Central squares (1 km) classified; surrounding four squares also allocated; resulted in a set of 32 Land Classes from 1228 central squares, extended to 6039 km squares overall for classification.
- Early survey frameworks:
  - 1978 CS: 256 squares surveyed (8 per class) for national habitat estimates.
  - 1984 CS: Increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); national estimates still computed from the 1978 framework.
- 1990 CS (All Squares Land Classification): Revision to classify every square in GB using major climatic, geological, and physiographic surrogates; some squares reassigned to new classes; 508 squares surveyed; addition of a Land Cover Map from satellite data; national estimates recalculated using the updated scheme.

## Evolution through CS2000 (England, Wales, Scotland)

- Rationale: Need reliable, country-specific estimates (England & Wales together, Scotland separately) for policy and reporting.
- Changes to support country-unit estimates:
  - Sub-division of existing Land Classes into country-unit versions (creating 40 strata from 32).
  - Aggregation where few squares remained in a country to maintain representation.
  - Additional sampling to ensure adequate representation of new classes (minimum 6 squares per class; 19–43 extra squares added).
  - Wales-specific adjustments: dedicated Welsh sub-classes and more Welsh squares.
  - Isle of Man: replaced by new England squares for country-unit reporting.
- Uplands module: additional 30 squares in upland/marginal upland classes to improve accuracy of upland habitat estimates.
- Outputs for CS2000:
  - England & Wales: wider set of strata and more squares (e.g., 30 Welsh-adjusted samples in some classes).
  - Scotland: maintained separate reporting framework; overall GB sampling adjusted accordingly.
- Summary table (CS2000 sampling):
  - Presents counts of squares per class and country-unit distribution to support country-specific estimates.

## Developments for CS2007 (Welsh enhancements and final framing)

- Welsh-only reporting needs increased since devolution and policy demands.
- Key adjustments:
  - Further country-unit subdivisions: five new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing to 45 strata.
  - Additional Welsh squares to bring Wales representation up (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class).
  - England adjustments: no new Wales-only gains in England; two classes in England (5e, 15e) end with 4 squares each, deemed acceptable per scoping study.
- Revised maps and tables show updated distribution of sample squares across England, Wales, and Scotland for CS2007.

## National estimates and reporting considerations

- Note on consistency: Changing the Land Classification used for national estimates affects cross-survey comparability; CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 use country-specific classifications to maintain internal consistency, while cross-survey comparisons may consider original (1990) vs latest classifications.
- Output considerations: Tables provide per-class and per-country sampling counts, areas, and sampling rates (1:x) to support interpretation of abundance estimates and change detection.
- Wales vs England/Scotland: Emphasis on ensuring adequate representation for Wales to enable Wales-only reporting, while maintaining overall national coherence.

## Data handling and practical implications for analysts

- The strategy emphasizes transparent documentation of stratification, sampling, and reclassification steps to enable replication and assessment of precision.
- Longitudinal comparisons require careful alignment of Land Class definitions across survey waves; analyses must account for class sub-divisions and country-unit aggregations.
- Uplands module addition demonstrates targeted sampling to improve precision in under-sampled or policy-relevant habitat types.
