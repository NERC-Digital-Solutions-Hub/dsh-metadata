# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner goodwill.
- Funded by NERC for the 2018/2019–2024 rolling program (NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme.
- 2007 CS partners include UKCEH (formerly CEH), Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission from landowners.
- Requests for information handled by UKCEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release: precision and circumstances
- Data can be released at varying levels of precision:
  - Four-digit grid references (to identify 10 km x 10 km grid squares) may be released under licence.
  - Six-digit grid references require additional justification; UKCEH can pre-process analyses to avoid releasing exact locations; very exceptional external releases may occur under licence if IP/confidentiality is equally protected.
  - Spatial data inside squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality considerations and follow the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
- Release decisions depend on whether approximate location data suffice for the user’s needs; precise releases are tightly controlled.

## Licensing terms and data handling
- Licensees must:
  - Preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
  - Hold licences for finite periods tied to specific projects; no retention beyond the project.
  - Destroy data at the end of the licensing period and confirm destruction in writing.
  - Not release data or derived information to third parties that could compromise square locations.
  - Not use data to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - Provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP when required.
  - For four-digit releases, use terms similar to six-digit data but with lower IP-confidentiality requirements, and avoid attempting to identify exact square locations.
- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) issues hardcopy licences; senior-level sign-off is required from licensee organisations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH decides on exceptional releases and issues licences; acts on behalf of NERC.
- Annual report provided by UKCEH detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Pre-processing support from UKCEH is encouraged to meet reasonable timeframes; case-by-case negotiation for non-CS-partner organisations.
- Organisations are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data to help define requirements and use appropriately; involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for data support practitioners
- When supporting requests, assess whether four-digit release suffices or if six-digit/exceptional release is needed.
- Coordinate with UKCEH early to determine feasibility, licensing scope, and pre-processing options.
- Ensure data handling aligns with licensing conditions: secure storage, access controls, finite project-based use, and destruction upon completion.
- Help licensees prepare documentation to demonstrate project management standards (JCOP-equivalent) if required.
- Communicate clearly that location data cannot be used to visit or monitor landowners or to identify exact square locations.

## Summary
- The CS location data policy tightly governs access to preserve sampling integrity and landowner support, permitting limited, licensed releases (primarily four-digit references) with strict confidentiality and usage controls.
- UKCEH leads licensing decisions on behalf of NERC, with annual reporting and a framework that supports pre-processed or controlled analysis to minimise exposure of precise locations.
- Data supports should facilitate compliant data access, coordinate with UKCEH, and help users design projects that meet confidentiality and governance requirements.
