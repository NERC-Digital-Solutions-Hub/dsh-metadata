# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Uses the ITE Land Classification as the core sampling framework to produce environmental habitat estimates at national and country levels, informing policy and monitoring environmental change.
  - Emphasizes the need for representative sampling and comparability over time.

- Core methodological principles
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain's varying landscapes.
  - Stratification based on land classification variables (environmental attributes such as altitude, geology, climate) to capture ecological variability.
  - Use of 1 km square sample units; initial centre squares classified, with surrounding squares included to capture local variability.
  - National estimates derived by combining mean habitat areas per Land Class with the total area of each class.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and first field survey)
    - Developed 32 Land Classes from 1 km squares using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on environmental attributes.
    - Classified 6039 squares (centre plus surrounding squares); 256 samples surveyed (8 per class).
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Increased per-class sampling to 12 squares; total 384 squares surveyed.
    - Maintained use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification and third field survey)
    - Revised to classify all 1 km squares in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Included a repeat of the 1984 quadrat data; linked with first Land Cover Map of GB.
    - Resulted in a major update to the Land Classification; some squares changed class.
  - 2000 (Developments of the Land Classification for CS2000)
    - Addressed policy needs for separate England & Wales vs Scotland reporting.
    - Land Classes subdivided to create country-unit versions; 40 strata created (from 32).
    - Added 19 extra squares to improve representation; 11 more to balance England-Wales sampling.
    - Wales-specific sub-division of Land Class 17 implemented to refine Wales results.
    - Isle of Man squares removed from national estimates; England-Wales framework redesigned.
    - Added upland habitat module to improve upland estimates for England & Wales.
  - 2007 (Developments for CS2007; Wales-focused reporting)
    - Further adjustments to support Wales-only reporting post-devolution.
    - Wales received additional Welsh-only classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Wales gained 43 additional squares; minimum 6 squares per Welsh class.
    - England adjustments limited; two English classes (5e, 15e) retained with 4 squares per class.
    - England, Wales, and Scotland class maps updated to reflect revised sampling framework.

- Sampling framework and outputs
  - CS1978: 256 field squares across 32 Land Classes (8 per class); early national estimates based on class areas and mean habitat per square.
  - CS1984: 384 field squares; increased sampling per class to reduce sampling error.
  - CS1990: All GB squares classified; 508 field squares surveyed; introduced Land Cover Map linkage; national estimates recalculated using updated classification.
  - CS2000: Separate country estimates introduced; 40 strata; additional country-specific sampling; upland habitat module added.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused adjustments; 45 strata; expanded Welsh sampling to enable Wales-only reporting; England sampling adjusted accordingly.
  - Outputs include national, England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales habitat estimates, with maps and tables detailing the distribution and sampling effort.
  - Notable methodological note: changing the Land Classification affects comparability of national estimates; preference given to using the latest classification for individual surveys while recognizing cross-survey consistency challenges.

- Practical considerations and challenges
  - Data representation and sampling bias risks addressed through stratification across multiple environmental determinants.
  - Wales under-sampling in earlier rounds addressed through targeted Welsh classes and added Welsh squares.
  - Balancing the need for country-specific reporting with maintaining comparability across survey years.
  - Computational limitations in early years influenced the use of centre squares and surrounding squares to build robust classifications.

- Outputs, documentation, and references
  - Key published outputs include Countryside Survey 1990 main report, CS2000 UK results, and CS2007 Wales reporting; ongoing methodological documentation outlines the linkage between Land Classification, sampling, and national estimates.
