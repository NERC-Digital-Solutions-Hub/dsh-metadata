# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Applies to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Covers the 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE National Capability.
- Partners include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects future survey viability, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Requests for information are handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release levels
- Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify the 10 km × 10 km grid containing each survey square.
- Six-digit grid references: considered very sensitive; released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances if the external need demonstrates IP data/models require equal or higher confidentiality, and analysis can’t be done by UKCEH.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality and may be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- When precise data could identify a square, UKCEH may pre-process analysis to avoid disclosure; exceptional access requires justification.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; never used to plan visits or assess landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar, but lower, IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases and include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- UKCEH makes exceptional-release decisions on behalf of NERC, applying policy principles.
- UKCEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by authorized representatives.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH follows FOI Act Regulations to support the decision.
- UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and rationales.
- For practical implementation, UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with UKCEH before using data covered by this policy; UKCEH involvement may be direct or negotiated as part of a collaboration or paid support.

## Process and governance
- Decisions and licensing are coordinated to balance data utility with confidentiality and future survey viability.
- Pre-processing and data-handling arrangements are planned to enable timely access while protecting square locations.
- Consultation with UKCEH is recommended to better define requirements and appropriate use.

## Practical guidance for data stewards
- Ensure any access aligns with the stated confidentiality policy and licensing terms.
- Manage licenses with clear end-dates and destruction confirmations.
- Maintain secure storage and limit access to authorized individuals.
- Document and report licensing decisions and the grounds for approvals or refusals.
- Coordinate with UKCEH early in any proposed project to assess feasibility and required safeguards.

## Additional notes
- The policy is designed to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and location anonymity.
- Only location-related data is restricted; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.
