# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
- Emphasizes the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its central role in stratified, random ecological sampling across Great Britain.
- Notes that the methodology is tightly linked to historical data series and essential for detecting change over time.

## Key Concepts: ITE Land Classification and Sampling Framework
- Land Classification (ITE) stratifies GB land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- Sampling units are 1 km squares; classification informs stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage.
- Early approach used a centre square within a 15 × 15 km grid; surrounding squares were also classified to propagate class assignments.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and multivariate methods were used to group vegetation and environmental features into land classes.

## Evolution of the Sampling Framework

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
- ISA-based 32 land classes derived from environmental data of 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 × 15 km grid; 1228 classified; plus surrounding squares).
- Sampling: eight 1 km squares per land class (256 total) surveyed in summer 1977–1978.
- National habitat area estimates calculated as mean habitat area per square within each land class multiplied by the land class area.

### 1984 – Second Field Survey
- Expansion to 12 squares per land class (384 total, including eight revisited).
- National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and Third Field Survey
- Land Classification updated to classify every square in GB (more comprehensive framework).
- 508 squares surveyed; included repetition of CS1984 vegetation quadrats and urban/sea corrections.
- Land Cover Map of GB linked to CS1990 results.

### 1998 – Revised Land Classification and Fourth Field Survey
- Classification extended to allow separate Scottish reporting; total land classes increased to 40.
- 569 squares surveyed in CS1998 (CS1990 framework used for national estimates).

### 2000 – CS2000: Separate Country Estimates and Class Adjustments
- Move to country-specific reporting (England & Wales vs Scotland).
- Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; class aggregation used where necessary.
- Added 19 additional squares to ensure adequate representation across new classes; further adjustments to Wales and Isle of Man (IOM) representations.
- An uplands module was added to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.

## Wales and England-Scotland Adjustments

### Separate Country Estimates
- Framework adapted to produce England & Wales vs Scotland estimates using country-specific squares.
- Changes included class subdivisions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and a split of 40 into 45 strata, with additional squares to maintain representation.

### Uplands Module
- Additional 30 squares placed in upland and marginal upland land classes to increase precision for upland habitat estimates.

## 2007 – Countryside Survey Wales-Only Reporting and Framework Refinements
- Wales-only reporting required Wales-specific habitat status and change information post-devolution.
- Introduced five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing to 45 strata.
- Added 43 Welsh squares (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class); England adjustments compensated by not increasing English squares.
- England retains most classes but two classes (5e, 15e) have only four squares.
- Wales-specific sub-division of Land Class 17 implemented to refine Welsh results.
- Updated class maps reflect revised England-with-Wales and Scotland frameworks; maps of sample squares provided.

## Outputs, Data Handling, and National Estimates

- Tables and figures (e.g., Tables 2–4; Figures 4–7) document square counts, class distributions, and sampling rates by year and country.
- National estimates are derived by multiplying mean habitat area per square by the area represented by each land class; this approach is designed to ensure comparability across time despite classification changes.
- Note on consistency: changing the Land Classification base for national estimates affects comparability; the preferred approach for a given survey may vary between within-survey consistency and cross-survey consistency.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Considerations

- The methodology emphasizes careful documentation of classification changes and their impact on time-series estimates, essential for data provenance and reproducibility.
- When adopting country-specific reporting, clear versioning and metadata are required to track which Land Class scheme was used for each set of estimates.
- Upland and Wales-specific modules introduce additional data elements that must be captured in metadata, including sampling intensity, class definitions, and spatial distribution.

## Summary

- The Countryside Survey sampling strategy evolves from a 32-class ITE Land Classification (1978) to a more refined framework (up to 45 classes by 2007) with country-specific reporting and upland modules.
- Central to the approach is stratified random sampling of 1 km squares, guided by land classes to ensure representative coverage and robust time-series analyses.
- Across CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, methodologies were adapted to provide Wales- and Scotland-specific estimates and to enable Wales-only reporting post-devolution, while maintaining clear documentation of changes to support data governance, comparability, and reproducibility.
