# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Sets a policy for access to CS survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public interest utility while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Notably, all other CS data remains publicly accessible.

## Background and context
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (UK-SCaPE National Capability).
- 2007 CS partners include UKCEH, Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Critical for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission.
- Requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Circumstances for release and precision level
- Four-digit grid references (10 km x 10 km) may be released under licence to identify general location within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references: allowed only if UKCEH pre-processing analysis cannot meet needs; otherwise, data not released externally.
- Very exceptional cases: six-digit release may occur under licence if the requester demonstrates, legally, equal or higher IP confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit location data.
- Four-digit releases are governed by similar licence terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality standard.

## Specific license conditions and usage limitations
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
- Post-license, organisations must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No release to third parties that could compromise CS square confidentiality; consult UKCEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits, verify landowner compliance, or identify exact square locations.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit license terms are similar but do not require the same IP confidentiality level as six-digit releases.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Licences must be signed by an authorized senior official from the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH supports the decision under statutory processes.
- UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Practical support for internal CS use: reasonable likelihood of UKCEH pre-processing analysis; access for other organisations considered case-by-case.
- Recommendation for potential data users to consult UKCEH before data use; may involve collaborative or paid support, negotiated case-by-case.
