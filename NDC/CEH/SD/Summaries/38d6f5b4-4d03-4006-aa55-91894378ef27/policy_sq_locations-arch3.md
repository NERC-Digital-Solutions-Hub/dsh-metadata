# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
- Funded by NERC (2018/2019–2024 rolling program; award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
- CS partners (2007) include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH (listed).

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys and scientific integrity.
- Public-interest justification; requests for information are handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## When locations can be released and at what precision
- Four-digit grid references (identifying 10 km x 10 km grid squares) may be released under licence to relevant users.
- Six-digit (precise) locations are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external access requires a legal demonstration that IP data to be used with CS data has equal or higher confidentiality protection than CS data, and cannot be released to UKCEH.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could indirectly reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals for the agreed purpose.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must not be retained after the project ends.
- Licensees must confirm in writing that location data remained secure and has been destroyed after the licence period.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; users should not attempt to derive precise locations.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality level of six-digit releases; licensing terms explicitly prohibit attempts to identify precise CS squares.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, procedures under FOI/Environmental Regulations are followed, and decisions are supported accordingly.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications and outcomes.
- For internal CS partnerships, UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; external requests are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for authors of monitoring frameworks
- Balances data utility with safeguards to maintain sampling integrity and landowner cooperation.
- Establishes tiered access (four-digit vs six-digit) to manage risk and data sensitivity.
- Highlights key governance roles (UKCEH, NERC) and mandatory data-handling standards (secure storage, destruction, JCOP equivalence).
- Encourages stakeholder consultation and transparent licensing workflows, with annual reporting on access activity.
