# Sampling design

## Overview
- Soils were sampled in the Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, 2007 and 2019, with a rolling survey starting in 2019 aiming to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
- In 1978 and 1998, the same 256 squares were sampled; in 2007, soils were collected from all 591 CS squares, though not all measurements were made on all samples.
- A pilot survey occurred in 2018.

## Sample location and plot design
- Samples come from CS X-plots; there are 5 X-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates and may represent different land uses or soil types.
- Over time, X-plots may be relocated due to plot destruction, access denial, or relocation uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1: square 2, repeat plot 1).
- Within a square, the same location yields samples approximately 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot corners.

## Sampling method and depth
- Soils are collected from the top 15 cm of the profile (8 cm for the invertebrate sample).
- 1998, 2007 and rolling 2018/2019–2023 used soil cores hammered into the soil and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm.
- In some cases, full 15 cm could not be collected due to stones or shallow soils; core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken by lab staff in 2007 for two of the four cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).
- The rolling CS survey adopted the core-based approach.

## Measurements and laboratory analyses
- In 1978, only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) were measured.
- In 1998, 2007 and rolling surveys, multiple cores were taken per X-plot with different measurements across cores; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI analyses (no chemical analyses by soil horizon).
- Bulk density was measured in 2007 and again in 2018/19–2023, but not using ISO bulk density methods (which would require an entire core).
- A full description and implications of these methods are documented in Emmett et al. (2008); a report on method development, power analyses and protocols for CS soils is Emmett et al. 2007.

## Data handling and quality considerations
- Core photographs and detailed core dimension data were collected where applicable.
- The CS design emphasizes dispersed sampling to maximize regional estimates, with attention to data structure and comparability across years.
- The emphasis is on consistent sampling methods and documentation to support long-term analysis and interpretation.

## Statistical analysis and interpretation
- Analyses should consider land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock and change estimates for the population, while accounting for land classes yields weighted national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not always used; the CS structure should be considered, and at minimum a mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to account for multiple X-plots within each CS square.
- For design-based approaches (where spatial structure is not central), a dispersed set of observations improves overall precision and regional coverage.
- Users are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications and the CS website for existing analyses and data usage.
