# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy governs access to CS spatial data specifically at survey square locations and within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- The 2018/2019–2024 rolling program is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

## Why locations are confidential

- CS square locations are kept confidential to preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protecting these elements is essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
- Requests for information are handled by UKCEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When locations may be released and at what precision

- Data can be released at four-digit grid references (identifying the 10 km x 10 km grid square) under licence for certain analyses.
- Precise six-digit grid references are only considered in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, where the external requester can demonstrate that their own data/models carry equal or higher confidentiality protection; such releases require UKCEH processing to avoid direct release of locations.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could indirectly identify square locations and are treated with the same exceptional release terms as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release

- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- After the licence period, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and was destroyed.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; cannot be used to plan visits or verify landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must show evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality; four-digit data must not be used to identify precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and licensing process

- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) makes exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences containing the policy terms.
- Licences must be signed by an authorised senior person from the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH will follow Act/Regulations to support the decision and provide an explanation.
- UKCEH will provide CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support to CS partner organisations within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- It is highly recommended that potential data users consult with UKCEH before committing to work with CS location data to help define requirements and appropriate use; involvement may be collaborative or paid and is negotiated case-by-case.

## Additional notes for analysts

- The policy supports responsible data governance to balance public-interest use of environmental data with protections for sampling integrity and landowner relationships.
- The approach enables controlled access for analyses that require locational context while safeguarding future survey viability.
