# Sampling design

- Soils were sampled in Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, 2007 and 2019, with evolving coverage over time.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares.
  - 2007 sampled soils from all 591 CS squares, though not all measurements were made on all samples.
  - 2019 marked the start of a rolling survey aiming to measure ~100 squares each year for five years before repeating.
  - A pilot survey occurred in 2018.

- Sampling framework and future plan
  - A rolling design began in 2019 to enable ongoing measurement and trend detection.
  - Power analyses (Emmett et al. 2008) informed the number of samples needed to detect significant change.

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Soils are sampled from CS X-plots; each CS square contains 5 randomly spaced X-plots.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to potential differences in land use and soil type.
  - Over time, X-plots may be relocated if a plot is destroyed, access is denied, or certainty of location is lost.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating square, repeat plot, and position; samples with the same ID originate from the same location but may be 2–3 m apart when sampled around the 2 m x 2 m plot corners.

- Sampling method and depth
  - Soils are collected from the top 15 cm of the profile (8 cm depth for invertebrate samples) in 1998, 2007, and the rolling survey (2018/19–2023).
  - In 1978, soil pits were dug and soil from the top 15 cm collected from the pit side.
  - Some samples could not reach the full 15 cm due to stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken in 2007 on 2 of the 4 cores (black cores and N mineralization cores); rolling CS survey later adopted this approach.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1990: some soil mapping occurred.
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling survey (2018/19–2023): multiple cores per X-plot with different measurements across cores.
  - Chemical analyses by horizons are not performed; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and again in 2018/19–2023, but not using ISO bulk density method (would require a whole core).
  - A full description and implications of methods are provided in Emmett et al. (2008).

- Data structure and considerations for analysis
  - In analyses, the structure of CS results must be accounted for; results may reflect population stock and change or national estimates depending on whether land class structure is included.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses.
  - A mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to account for multiple X-plots within each CS square.
  - CS is a design-based approach where spatial structure is not the primary interest; a dispersed set of observations can improve overall precision and regional coverage when estimating stock and change.
  - When using CS soils data, consult UKCEH before analysis and interpretation and check CS-listed publications for previously exploited datasets (CS website).
