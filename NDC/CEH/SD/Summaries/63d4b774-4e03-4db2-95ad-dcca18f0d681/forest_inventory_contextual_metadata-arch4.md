# Tree census in permanent forest plots across the Amazon Basin

## Data Overview
- Dataset: 'tree_data.csv' with DBH measurements for 8,729 trees across 29 RAINFOR forest plots in the Brazilian Amazon (Acre, Mato Grosso, Pará).
- Forest type: terra-firme, nonflooded lowland forests.
- Time frame: measurements collected between 2017 and 2019.
- DBH unit: millimeters (mm).

## Collection methods
- Plots were established in prior campaigns; plot sizes range from 0.25 ha to 1 ha.
- Each tree tagged in the field; new recruits (DBH > 100 mm) receive a new tag and are included on that census.
- Dead trees recorded with cause of death and decomposition stage.
- For living trees, tree state is noted.
- Field codes follow the standardized RAINFOR protocol; procedures documented at forestplots.net.

## Data Analysis
- Field sheets digitised, checked for errors, and uploaded to ForestPlots.net, integrating with previous censuses for long-term forest dynamics analysis.
- Research linked to investigations into past fires and current carbon dynamics in Amazonian forests.
- Study supported by multiple grants and institutions (e.g., NERC, CAPES Brazil, Royal Society, CNPq, FAPESP, PPBio, and FATE).

## Nature and Units of recorded values
- DBH values recorded in millimeters (mm).

## Quality Control
- Data quality controlled following ForestPlots.net protocol; DBH measurements verified individually with corrective actions as needed.

## Details of data structure
- CSV columns:
  - Plot_number: plot code
  - Tree_ID: tree identifier within the network
  - Tag_No: field tag code for the tree
  - DBH: Diameter at Breast Height
  - Latitude: geographic latitude
  - Longitude: geographic longitude

## Funding and references
- Data context and network referenced in ForestPlots.net and the 2021 Biological Conservation paper.
- Funding acknowledgments include multiple Brazilian and international sources (NERC, CAPES, Royal Society, CNPq, PPBio, FAPESP, among others).

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: standardized field protocols (RAINFOR), tagging, digitisation, QC, and integration into a central data network (ForestPlots.net) for cross-study comparability and long-term analysis.
- Emphasizes the importance of metadata, data discoverability, and clear data structure (consistent column schema and unit definitions).
- Highlights cross-institution collaboration and linking of data collection to broader ecological research on fire impact and carbon dynamics.
