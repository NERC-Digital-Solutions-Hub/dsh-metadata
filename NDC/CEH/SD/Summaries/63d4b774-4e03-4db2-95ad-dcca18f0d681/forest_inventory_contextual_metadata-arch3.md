# Tree census in permanent forest plots across the Amazon Basin

## Data Overview
- 8,729 trees measured for Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)
- 29 RAINFOR network forest plots across the Brazilian Amazon (Acre, Mato Grosso, Pará)
- Forests are terra-firme, nonflooded lowland
- Measurements collected between 2017 and 2019
- DBH recorded in millimeters (mm)

## Collection Methods
- Plots sized 0.25 ha or 1 ha
- Trees tagged in the field; DBH re-measured at breast height
- New recruits (DBH > 100 mm) receive a new tag
- For dead trees: cause of death and decomposition stage recorded
- For living trees: state of the tree noted
- Field procedures follow the RAINFOR protocol
- Codes and measurements documented in the field spreadsheet

## Data Analysis and Provenance
- Field sheets digitised, quality-checked, and uploaded to ForestPlots.net
- Data integrated with previous censuses to analyze long-term forest dynamics
- Part of the project addressing: "Do past fires explain current carbon dynamics of Amazonian forests?"
- Supported by multiple funders, including NERC, CAPES, Royal Society FORAMA, CNPq, PPBio, FATE, and FAPESP

## Data Quality and Structure
- Quality Control: adherence to ForestPlots.net QC protocol; DBH verified individually and corrected as needed
- Data file format: CSV (tree_data.csv)
- Key columns: Plot_number, Tree_ID, Tag_No, DBH (mm), Latitude, Longitude

## Data Use and Governance
- Data shared via ForestPlots.net to enable transparency, replication, and cross-plot comparisons
- Dataset supports monitoring and evaluation of long-term forest health and carbon dynamics
- Metadata and data provenance are maintained to facilitate verification and reuse
