# Tree census in permanent forest plots across the Amazon Basin

- Data overview: 'tree_data.csv' contains DBH information for 8,729 trees across 29 RAINFOR forest plots in the Brazilian Amazon (Acre, Mato Grosso, Pará); plots are terra-firme, nonflooded lowland forests; measurements collected 2017–2019.
- Data purpose: supports analysis of long-term forest dynamics by enabling integration with previous censuses via ForestPlots.net.

## Data Content

- DBH units: millimeters (mm).
- Columns and identifiers: Plot_number, Tree_ID, Tag_No, DBH, Latitude, Longitude.
- Coverage: 29 plots across multiple states; 8,729 individual trees.

## Methods and Quality Assurance

- Field collection:
  - Plots sized 0.25 ha to 1 ha.
  - Trees tagged; DBH measured with measuring tape.
  - New recruits added (DBH > 100 mm); dead trees recorded with cause of death and decomposition stage.
  - State of living trees noted.
  - Observations encoded using the RAINFOR protocol.
- Data processing:
  - Field sheets digitized, checked for errors, and uploaded to ForestPlots.net.
  - Data linked with prior censuses to enable long-term analyses.
- Quality control:
  - Following ForestPlots.net protocol; DBHs verified individually with corrective actions as needed.

## Data Access, Standards, and Governance

- Standardized data capture via the RAINFOR protocol ensures consistency across plots and time.
- Metadata structure supports interoperability and reuse (Plot_number, Tree_ID, Tag_No, DBH, Latitude, Longitude).
- Data integrated with historical datasets for continuity and broader analyses of Amazonian forest dynamics.
- Availability through ForestPlots.net, with proper citation guidelines.

## Provenance and Supporting Context

- Associated research aims: Do past fires explain current carbon dynamics of Amazonian forests?
- Funding and support from multiple organizations (e.g., NERC, CAPES Brazil, Royal Society, CNPq, PPBio, PELD programs, FAPESP, FATE) across international collaborations.

## Stewardship Considerations for Data Stewards

- Ensure ongoing metadata completeness and consistency across plots and census years.
- Maintain data quality through periodic verification and alignment with the ForestPlots.net standard.
- Plan for updates or additions (new censuses, updated coordinates, revised DBH measurements) and reflect in documentation.
- Monitor data accessibility and governance implications when integrating with broader data networks to support discoverability and reuse.
