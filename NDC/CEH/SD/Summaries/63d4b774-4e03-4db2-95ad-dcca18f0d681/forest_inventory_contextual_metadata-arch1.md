# Tree census in permanent forest plots across the Amazon Basin

## Data scope and measurements
- 8,729 trees measured for Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)
- 29 forest plots across the Brazilian Amazon (Acre, Mato Grosso, Pará)
- Plot type: terra-firme, nonflooded lowland forests
- Measurements collected between 2017 and 2019
- DBH unit: millimeters (mm)

## Plot design and field methods
- Forest plots sized 0.25 ha to 1 ha
- Each tree tagged with a field code; new recruits added when DBH > 100 mm
- For dead trees, recorded cause of death and decomposition stage
- For living trees, recorded tree state
- Field encoding follows the RAINFOFOR protocol
- Fieldwork conducted in alignment with ForestPlots.net field procedures

## Data processing and quality control
- Field sheets digitised, checked for errors, and uploaded to ForestPlots.net
- Quality control follows ForestPlots.net protocol
- Individual DBH values verified; corrective measures applied as needed

## Data structure and access
- Data file: tree_data.csv
- Columns: Plot_number, Tree_ID, Tag_No, DBH, Latitude, Longitude
- DBH values stored in millimeters
- Dataset attached with described structure
- Data hosted on ForestPlots.net, enabling long-term forest dynamics analysis

## Context, aims, and potential uses
- Part of the project addressing whether past fires explain current carbon dynamics of Amazonian forests
- Related funding and support from CAPES, CNPq, Royal Society for the Global Challenge Award FORAMA, PELD programs, Rede Amazônia Sustentável, PPBio, FATE, FAPESP, and others
- Data supports analysis of long-term forest dynamics, spatial patterns, and potential correlations between disturbance history (e.g., fires) and current carbon dynamics
