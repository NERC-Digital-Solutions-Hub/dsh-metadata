# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 is available in both vector and raster formats to suit diverse user needs and supports data products for exploration and analysis across the UK.

## Data Formats and Coverage

- Vector data
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile
  - Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectares
  - Each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes and metadata describing how the information was derived
  - Coverage: United Kingdom

- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total
  - 25 x 25 m raster: provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarize the 25 x 25 m raster
  - Supply format: GeoTiff
  - Coverage: United Kingdom
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes

## Metadata and Documentation

- Detailed metadata for raster formats is available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation
- Tables within the documentation:
  - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets

## Using the Data (Data Support Perspective)

- Enables creation of self-service data products (e.g., dashboards, maps) and supports combining datasets for broader analyses
- Vector data is best for detailed parcel-level information; raster data is suitable for broad habitat summaries
- Outputs can be promoted, shared, and iterated based on user feedback to improve usefulness and re-use
