# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview
- LCM2007 is available in both vector and raster formats to suit different user needs.

## Vector data
- Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel.
- Attributes describe land cover; metadata describes how the information was derived.
- Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectares.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).

## Raster data
- Five raster products.
- 25 x 25 m raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products summarise the 25 x 25 m raster.
- Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.

## Scales and formats
- Raster pixel sizes: 25 m and 1 km.
- Supply format: GeoTiff.
- Coverage: UK.

  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets

## Analysts considerations
- Use vector for high-detail, parcel-level analysis; use rasters for broad habitat summaries.
- Be mindful of format differences (Shapefile vs GeoTiff) and UK coverage.
- Consult the dataset documentation for attribute definitions, class mappings, and metadata.
