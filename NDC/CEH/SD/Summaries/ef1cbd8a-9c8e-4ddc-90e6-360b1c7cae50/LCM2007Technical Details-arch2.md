# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- Land Cover Map 2007 provides UK land cover information in both vector and raster formats to support environmental monitoring and policy assessment over time.
- Data are designed for standardised use and comparison, aligning with ongoing monitoring responsibilities.

## Data Formats

### Vector data
- Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata describing derivation (see dataset documentation).
- Scale: Minimum Mapable Unit for land cover parcels is 0.5 ha.
- Supply Format: ESRI Shapefile
- Coverage: UK

### Raster data
- Five raster products simplify the information.
- 25 x 25 m raster: provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products summarise the 25 x 25 m raster.
- Scale: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
- Supply Format: GeoTiff
- Coverage: UK

## Documentation and Metadata
- Further information is available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation, including:
  - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes for LCM2007
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets

## How this supports monitoring and analysis
- Provides standardized land cover data for assessing environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Outputs can be integrated with other data sources to enhance analytical value and help illustrate environmental trends.

## Practical considerations for Analysts
- Metadata and attribute tables available to inform data interpretation.
- Widely supported formats (Shapefile, GeoTiff) facilitate storage, sharing, and portal uploads.
- Be mindful of resolution differences: vector MMU of 0.5 ha and raster resolutions (25 m and 1 km) when combining or comparing datasets.

## Challenges and opportunities
- Opportunity to increase dataset value by combining LCM2007 with other relevant data sources.
- Emphasis on enabling access to underlying data used to generate outputs.
