# Land Cover Map 2007

## Overview
- Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) provides UK land cover data in both vector and raster formats.
- Includes attributes describing land cover and metadata describing data derivation.
- Comprehensive dataset documentation accompanies the data.

## Data formats and scales
- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel.
  - Attributes describe land cover; metadata describe derivation.
  - Minimum mappable unit: 0.5 hectares.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total.
  - One 25 x 25 m raster giving the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarising the 25 x 25 m data.
  - Detailed metadata for raster formats available.
  - Supply format: GeoTiff.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.

## Coverage
- United Kingdom (UK).

## Metadata, attributes, and documentation
- Detailed metadata and attributes documented in the LCM2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Documentation includes:
  - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Supports policy scrutiny and environmental health monitoring through multi-resolution land cover information.
- Multiple formats accommodate different user needs (detailed vector vs. scalable rasters) and emphasize traceability and data quality via comprehensive metadata and documentation.

## Access, sharing, and governance considerations
- Free raster products enhance openness; vector data and accompanying metadata/documentation support governance and data quality standards.
- Some data transformations may be required to integrate formats into monitoring tools.
