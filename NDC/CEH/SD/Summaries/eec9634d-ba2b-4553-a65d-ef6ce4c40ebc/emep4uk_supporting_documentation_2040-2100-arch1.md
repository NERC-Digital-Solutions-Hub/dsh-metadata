# Heavy metal, nitrogen, and sulphur atmospheric deposition with the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program Model for the UK (EMEP4UK) for 2040, 2070 and 2100 for SSP scenarios 1-5

## Overview
- Provides annual total atmospheric deposition for cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), sulphur (S), and nitrogen (N) over the UK for 2040, 2070, and 2100 under SSP scenarios 1–5.
- Based on EMEP4UK model rv4.36 (an atmospheric chemistry transport model) with WRF meteorology v4.2.2.
- UK domain nested within a 27×27 km2 EU domain, with results excerpted for the UK at 3×3 km2 resolution.

## Experimental design / Model setup
- Meteorology: 2018 meteorology used, generated by WRF 4.2.2 with data assimilation from NCEP/NCAR GFS every 6 hours.
- Emissions:
  - UK NOx, NH3, SO2, primary PM2.5, primary PMcoarse, CO, and non-methane VOC from 2019 National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI), rescaled to 2018.
  - Non-UK emissions from CEIP 0.1°×0.1° data; UK total applied for 2018.
  - Heavy metal historical emissions (1750–1960) from literature; contemporary (1970–2018) from UK NAEI (2021). Projections use UK-specific SSPs.
- Model components: EMEP4UK rv4.36 coupled to WRF; domain and configuration described; FORTRAN Intel compiler used; runs performed on UKCEH POLAR cluster.

## Data files and structure
- 15 NetCDF files named EMEP4UK_met2018_emisSSP#-YYYY.nc (SSP# = 1–5; YYYY = 2040, 2070, 2100).
- Temporal coverage: annual outputs for the specified years; timestamp mid-year.
- Spatial grid: longitude/latitude grid with 240×240 points (UK within the EU 27°×27° domain).
- Variables included (with general units):
  - WDEP_PREC: rainfall (mm).
  - WDEP_WET: wet deposition of oxidised sulphur (SOX), oxidised nitrogen (OXN), reduced nitrogen (RDN) in mg/m2.
  - DDEP_CD, DDEP_CU, DDEP_NI, DDEP_PB, DDEP_ZN: dry deposition of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn in mg/m2.
  - DDEP_SOX: dry deposition of oxidised sulphur (mgS/m2).
  - DDEP_OXN, DDEP_RDN: dry deposition of oxidised/reduced nitrogen (mgN/m2).
  - Area_Grid_km2: grid area in km2.
- NetCDF structure includes standard time/lat/lon dimensions and a history attribute documenting postprocessing.

## Variables and units (highlights)
- Dry deposition (area-weighted) and wet deposition for heavy metals, nitrogen, and sulphur.
- Wet deposition variables: WDEP_SOX, WDEP_OXN, WDEP_RDN, WDEP_CD, WDEP_CU, WDEP_NI, WDEP_PB, WDEP_ZN (units: mg/m2; rainfall in mm).
- Dry deposition variables: DDEP_SOX_m2Grid, DDEP_OXN_m2Grid, DDEP_RDN_m2Grid, DDEP_CD_m2Grid, DDEP_CU_m2Grid, DDEP_NI_m2Grid, DDEP_PB_m2Grid, DDEP_ZN_m2Grid (units: mg/m2 or mgN/m2 per species; grid-weighted).

## Quality assurance and limitations
- Full QA/QC completed for the year 2018 (not included in this dataset); QA/QC reports available on request.
- Visual comparisons used for remaining historical and future runs.
- Usage is at user’s risk; no warranty that content is error-free or fit for a particular purpose.
- Key limitation for analysts: meteorology data are fixed to 2018 for all projection runs; emissions and SSPs drive changes, but atmosphere uses 2018 meteorology.

## Practical use for analysts
- Suitable for assessing UK-wide future deposition under multiple SSP scenarios at a 3×3 km UK resolution, using a robust ACTMWRF framework.
- Useful for correlating deposition changes with environmental or health outcomes, while noting the fixed 2018 meteorology and the need to consider data access and metadata for reproducibility.
- Datasets are organized and described with explicit variable names and units to enable integration with other data sources and models.
