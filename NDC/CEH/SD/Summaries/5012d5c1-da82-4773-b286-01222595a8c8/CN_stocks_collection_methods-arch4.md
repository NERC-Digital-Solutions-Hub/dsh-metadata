# Soil sampling

- Two soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width auger; soil collected as deep as possible.
- Soil passed through a sieve with 2 mm aperture to remove stones and roots.
- Stones retained were weighed to determine the proportion of gravel and chalk flints.
- Soil cores split into 5 cm depth increments; dried at 80°C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Cores stored at 25°C until ready for processing.

## Bulk density

- Soil weighed; bulk density (BD) calculated as mass/volume.
- BD adjusted for gravel incursions using a formula incorporating the percentage of gravel.

## Carbon and nitrogen analysis

- Each depth fraction ground in a ball mill at 25 s^-1 for two minutes.
- Carbonates dissolved with 10% HCl until effervescence ceased; samples redried.
- About 10 ± 0.5 mg used for combustion analysis.
- Analysis performed on an Elementar vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with acetanilide (10.45% N, 71.4% C).
- Carbon and nitrogen stocks calculated for each soil depth (based on depth fractions).

## Quality control

- Standards and blanks run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser.
- 5% analytical replicates included.
