# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Long-term field study (March 2013 – September 2016) to understand how different plant communities influence carbon and nutrient cycling on bare chalk at Winklebury Hill.
- Primary aim: test carbon storage and soil fertility outcomes across plant groups that have distinct functional effects on their environment.

## Objectives

- Compare how three plant functional groups (FGs) affect carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health.
- Test how plant traits translate into measurable ecosystem processes (carbon and nitrogen cycling) and how these relate to group characteristics.

## Methods

- Site and setup
  - Location: chalk grassland on Winklebury Hill.
  - Plot design: 42 plots arranged in a grid of 7 across by 6 down; each plot 8m x 8m with a 2m gap between plots.
  - Timeframe: plots established and maintained from 2013 through 2016.
- Plant functional groups (FGs)
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots with simple root structure and large leaves; includes both short- and long-lived species; predicted to enhance soil carbon storage by depositing carbon deeper in the soil.
    - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; relatively minor carbon/N effects on the surrounding environment.
    - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, wide-root systems; rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity, possibly reducing long-term carbon storage.
    - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
- Experimental design
  - A full factorial arrangement: every plot contains a combination of FG1, FG2, and FG3 in various combinations.
  - Replication: six replicates across the grid (six rows of replication).
  - Treatment combinations: seven across (FG1, FG2, FG3 in all combinations) organized so all three-group combinations appear in each row.
- Data collection focus
  - Measurements of carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health linked to the functional traits of the planted groups.
  - Data on plant community composition and plot-level treatments to enable analysis of interactions between FG1/FG2/FG3 effects.
- Drought treatment (rain shelters)
  - From 2015 onwards: rain shelters added to plots to simulate drought.
  - Shelter regime: deployed from early June to mid-July, representing an extreme drought event (approximately once every 100 years).

## Data considerations and implications for Data Leaders

- Data assets
  - Plot-level design and treatment codes (FG combinations, replication, layout).
  - Plant functional group classifications and specific species lists per FG.
  - Temporal data on carbon storage, nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and microbial activity.
  - Drought treatment records (shelter presence and duration) and corresponding environmental data.
- Metadata and discoverability
  - Clear documentation of FG definitions, plot coordinates, treatment combinations, and timepoints to enable reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
  - Consistent naming conventions for plots and treatments to support data integration with wider data communities.
- Analysis opportunities
  - Evaluate main effects and interactions of FG1, FG2, and FG3 on carbon storage and soil fertility.
  - Assess drought impact by comparing sheltered vs. non-sheltered plots across FG combinations.
  - Link plant functional traits to ecosystem outcomes and potential feedbacks to carbon cycling.
- Governance and collaboration
  - Maintain a living data dictionary and update metadata as analyses progress.
  - Consider sharing data with broader networks studying plant functional traits and ecosystem processes to support community data practices.
