# Soil sampling

- Objective: Document a protocol for collecting soil samples and measuring key chemical and microbial properties across sites to enable comparisons and data products.

## Sampling procedure
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm width auger to a depth of 10 cm (as far as possible).
- Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Bulk density
- From two cores per site, samples split into depth intervals 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm.
- Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Bulk density calculated as mass/volume.

## Volumetric moisture content
- 5 ± 0.001 g of fresh soil taken from each sample and dried at 80 °C for 48 hours.
- Moisture content calculated as a proportion of the wet weight (post-drying weight relative to wet weight).

## Water extractable N and C
- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 ml Milli-Q water and shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour.
- Solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper.
- Undiluted filtrate analyzed for DIN (NH4, NO3, total N) using an AA3 autoanalyser with UV digester.
- Undiluted filtrate analyzed for DOC using a Shimadzu TOC analyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture: DIN/DOC mg/kg = (raw value × (water content of sample + extract volume × dilution factor) × 1000) / dry weight of soil used.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 ml 1 M KCl, shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour.
- Filtrate filtered and diluted 2:1, analyzed for DIN (NH4 and NO3) by autoanalyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture: DIN mg/kg = (raw AA value × (water content of sample + extract volume × dilution factor) × 100) / dry weight of soil used.
- A second 5 g soil sample incubated with Parafilm covers in extraction bottles and kept at 25 °C for 14 days.
- After incubation, extracts analyzed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days, yielding g m⁻² day⁻¹.

## Microbial biomass
- 5 g fresh soil placed in a desiccator with damp paper towels and a beaker of 50 ml chloroform; desiccator sealed and vacuum applied until chloroform boils, left for 24 hours to lyse microbial cells.
- A second 5 g sample used as unfumigated control.
- Post-lyse, nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken at 150 rpm for 30 minutes.
- Solution filtered and analysed on the autoanalyser at dilutions of 4:1 (fumigated) and 2:1 (unfumigated) for DIN and extractable PO4; dissolved carbon measured by TOC-L using the same dilutions.
- Values adjusted for water content; extraction efficiency corrected using KE C (0.35) or KEN (0.54) quotients.

## Outputs, calculations and data handling
- Measured and calculated data per site (and depth where applicable): DIN (NH4, NO3, total N), DOC, extractable P (PO4), microbial biomass indicators, mineralisation rate, bulk density, and volumetric moisture content.
- Key conversions and calculations:
  - Moisture-adjusted nutrient concentrations (mg/kg) using the specified moisture corrections.
  - Mineralisation rate in g m⁻² day⁻¹.
  - Biomass estimates adjusted for extraction efficiency with KE C/ KEN factors.
- Data products intended for cross-site comparison and reporting, enabling self-service analysis and interpretation by end users.
