# Soil sampling

## Six soil samples and preparation
- Six soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width auger, at a depth of 10 cm where possible.
- Soils passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Bulk density
- Bulk density measured from two cores per site; split into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths.
- Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Soil weighed and bulk density calculated as mass/volume.

## Volumetric moisture content
- 5 ± 0.001 g of fresh soil per sample dried at 80 °C for 48 hours.
- Post-drying weight recorded; moisture content calculated as a proportion of the wet weight.

## Water extractable N and C
- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 ml Milli-Q water; shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour.
- Solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper.
- Undiluted filtrate analysed for DIN (NH4, NO3, total N) using a Seal Analytical AA3 autoanalyser with UV digester.
- Undiluted filtrate analysed for DOC using a Shimadzu TOC analyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using: DIN/DOC mg/kg = (raw analyser value × (water content of sample + extract volume × dilution factor) × 1000) / dry weight of soil.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 ml 1 M KCl; shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour.
- Solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper.
- Filtrate diluted 2:1 and analysed for DIN (NH4 and NO3) using an autoanalyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using: DIN mg/kg = (raw AA value × (water content of sample + extract volume × dilution factor) × 100) / dry weight of soil.
- An additional 5 g of soil placed in extraction bottles, covered with Parafilm, incubated at 25 °C for 14 days.
- Samples extracted and analysed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days = mineralisation g m⁻² day⁻¹.

## Microbial biomass
- 5 g fresh soil placed in glass beakers inside a desiccator with damp paper towels and a beaker containing 50 ml chloroform; desiccator vacuumed until chloroform boiled, left for 24 hours to lyse microbial cells.
- A further 5 g fresh soil used for an unfumigated comparison.
- After 24 hours, nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken at 150 rpm for 30 minutes.
- Solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper and analysed on the autoanalyser at dilutions of 4:1 for fumigated and 2:1 for unfumigated samples.
- DIN and extractable PO4 measured; dissolved carbon analysed using TOC-L at the same dilutions as N.
- Values adjusted for water content as above, then KE C or KEN quotients applied to adjust for extraction efficiency (0.35 and 0.54, respectively).
