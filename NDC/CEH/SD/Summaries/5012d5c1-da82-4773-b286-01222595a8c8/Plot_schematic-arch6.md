# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Aim
  - Use seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk.
  - Test resulting carbon and nutrient (nitrogen) cycling rates.
  - Compare ecosystem responses to the characteristics of plant functional effect groups.
  - Study conducted from March 2013 to September 2016.

- Experimental design and layout
  - Field laid out as a grid: 7 plots across by 6 plots down, with 8 m x 8 m plots and 2 m gaps between plots.
  - Each plot represents a unique combination of three plant functional effect groups (FGs); all combinations included and replicated across the grid (six replicates total).
  - Slopes arranged with top-to-bottom positioning to capture potential microtopography effects.
  - From 2015 onward, rain shelters added to plots to simulate drought conditions (extreme drought event, once in 100 years) from June to mid-July.

- Plant functional groups and species
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; large leaves; includes long-lived and some annual/biennial species; predicted to enhance soil carbon storage by moving carbon deeper into the soil.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited soil carbon/significant presence; includes species such as daisies, red fescue, primrose, broad-leaved thyme.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large fleshy leaves; rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential for lower long-term soil carbon storage due to quick turnover.
  - Examples of species per group provided, illustrating representative flora assigned to each FG.

- Data collection and outcomes
  - Primary interest in measuring carbon storage in soil, nitrogen cycling rates, and microbial activity across different FG treatment combinations.
  - Assessment of ecosystem health and potential differences in carbon dynamics and soil fertility driven by FG configurations.
  - Data would support comparisons between plant functional groups and their influence on soil and ecosystem processes.

- Timeline and treatments
  - Study period: March 2013 – September 2016.
  - Drought treatment implemented from 2015 onward via rain shelters, applied June–July to mimic extreme drought conditions.
  
- Notes on data context for use in analyses
  - The design enables evaluation of how combinations of plant functional traits influence carbon and nitrogen cycling relative to individual FG characteristics.
  - The replicated, grid-based layout supports robust comparisons and potential generalization to similar chalk grassland systems.
