# Soil sampling

- Six soil samples per site were collected with a 4 cm width augur, reaching up to 10 cm depth; material passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones/roots and stored at 5 °C until processing.
- Bulk density (BD) measurements were taken from two cores per site, splitting into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths, dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving; BD calculated as mass/volume.
- Volumetric moisture content was determined by drying 5 ± 0.001 g of fresh soil from each sample at 80 °C for 48 hours; moisture content calculated as a proportion of the wet weight.

- Water extractable N and C:
  - 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 ml Milli-Q water, shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour; filtered through Whatman No. 1.
  - Undiluted filtrate analyzed for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: NH4+, NO3-, and total N) via autoanalyser with UV digester; undiluted filtrate analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) via TOC analyzer.
  - Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using: DIN/DOC mg/kg = (raw value × (water content + extract volume) × dilution factor × 1000) / dry soil weight.

- KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation:
  - 5 g soil with 25 ml 1 M KCl, shaken 1 hour; filtered; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for DIN (NH4+, NO3-) via autoanalyser.
  - DIN adjusted for soil moisture using: DIN mg/kg = (raw value × (water content + extract volume) × dilution factor) × 100 / dry soil weight.
  - A separate 5 g soil sample was incubated at 25 °C for 14 days; extracts analyzed as above.
  - Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × BD / number of days, reported as g m^-2 day^-1.

- Microbial biomass (fumigation-extraction method):
  - 5 g soil placed in beakers, fumigated with chloroform in a desiccator for 24 hours to lyse microbes; unfumigated soil used as comparison.
  - After fumigation, nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken 30 minutes; filtered and analyzed by autoanalyser at dilutions (fumigated 4:1, unfumigated 2:1) for DIN and extractable phosphate (PO4); dissolved carbon measured by TOC-L using the same dilutions.
  - Values adjusted for soil moisture; microbial biomass estimates corrected for extraction efficiency using KE values (C = 0.35, N = 0.54).
