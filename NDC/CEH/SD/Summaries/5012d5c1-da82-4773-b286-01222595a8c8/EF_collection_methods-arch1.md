# Soil sampling

## Soil sampling
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm width augur to a depth of 10 cm where possible.
- Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Bulk density
- Bulk density measured from two cores per site, split into 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths.
- Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving; weighed.
- Bulk density calculated as mass/volume.

## Volumetric moisture content
- 5 ± 0.001 g of fresh soil from each sample dried at 80 °C for 48 hours.
- Post-drying weight recorded; moisture content calculated as a proportion of the wet weight.

## Water extractable N and C
- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 mL Milli-Q water; shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour.
- Solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper.
- Undiluted filtrate analysed for DIN (NH4, NO3, total N) using a Seal AA3 autoanalyser with UV digester.
- Undiluted filtrate analysed for DOC using a Shimadzu TOC analyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using: DIN/DOC mg/kg = (raw analyser value × (water content of sample (L) + extract vol (L) × dilution factor) × 1000) / dry weight of soil used.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
- 5 g fresh soil weighed and mixed with 25 mL 1 M KCl; shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour.
- Solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analysed for DIN (NH4 and NO3) using an autoanalyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using: DIN mg/kg = (raw AA value × (water content of sample (L) + extract vol (L) × dilution factor) × 100) / dry weight of soil used.
- An additional 5 g of each soil sample placed into extraction bottles, covered with Parafilm, and incubated at 25 °C for 14 days.
- Incubated samples extracted and analysed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days = mineralisation g m^-2 day^-1.

## Microbial biomass
- 5 g fresh soil placed into glass beakers and fumigated using a desiccator with chloroform; desiccator sealed with vacuum applied until chloroform boiled, left for 24 hours.
- A second 5 g sample prepared as unfumigated control.
- After fumigation, nutrients extracted with 25 mL 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken at 150 rpm for 30 minutes.
- Solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper and analysed on the autoanalyser at dilutions: 4:1 for fumigated, 2:1 for unfumigated.
- DIN and extractable PO4 measured; dissolved carbon analysed using TOC-L at the same dilutions.
- Values adjusted for water content; KE_C or K_EN quotients used to adjust for extraction efficiency (0.35 and 0.54, respectively).
