# Soil sampling

## Sampling design and preparation
- Two soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width auger, as deep as possible.
- Soil was passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Retained stones were weighed to determine the proportion of gravel and chalk flints.
- Soil cores were split into 5 cm depth increments, dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Samples were stored at 25 °C until processing.

## Bulk density measurement and adjustment
- Bulk density (BD) was calculated as mass divided by volume.
- BD was adjusted for gravel content: Adjusted BD = (unadjusted BD) × (100 − % gravel) / 100.

## Carbon and nitrogen analysis workflow
- Each depth fraction was ground in a ball mill at 25 s⁻¹ for 2 minutes.
- Carbonates were dissolved with 10% HCl in a dropwise process until effervescence ceased.
- Samples were redried, and 10 ± 0.5 mg was used for combustion analysis.
- Analysis performed with an Elementar vario EL combustion analyzer, calibrated with acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).

## Stock calculations
- Carbon and nitrogen stocks were calculated for each soil depth based on the measured concentrations and depth-specific mass (exact stock formulas referenced but not fully displayed in the document).

## Quality control and data integrity
- Standards and blanks were run every 20 samples on the combustion analyzer.
- 5% analytical replicates were included to assess precision.
