# Soil sampling

- Standardized field and laboratory procedures to sample, process, and analyze soil for environmental monitoring, including bulk density and carbon/nitrogen stocks, with quality control measures.

## Soil sampling and initial processing

- Two soil samples collected per site using a 4 cm width auger, taking soil as deep as possible.
- Samples passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Stones retained weighed to determine the proportion of gravel and chalk flints in the sample.
- Soil cores divided into 5 cm depth increments.
- Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Dried samples stored at 25 °C until ready for processing.

## Bulk density

- Soil weighed; bulk density (BD) calculated as mass/volume.
- BD adjusted for gravel content using: Adjusted BD = (unadjusted BD) × (1 − % gravel/100).
- Gravel percent determined from weighed stones in the sample.

## Carbon and nitrogen analysis

- Each depth fraction ground in a ball mill at 25 s⁻¹ for two minutes.
- Carbonates dissolved with 10% HCl added dropwise until effervescence ceased.
- Samples redried; approximately 10 ± 0.5 mg used for combustion analysis.
- Analysis performed on an Elementar vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).
- Carbon and nitrogen stocks calculated for each soil depth using the appropriate stock formula.

## Quality control

- Standards and blanks run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser.
- Analytical replicates included at a 5% rate.
