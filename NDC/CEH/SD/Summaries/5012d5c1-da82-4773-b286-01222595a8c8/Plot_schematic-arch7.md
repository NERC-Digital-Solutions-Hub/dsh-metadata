# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Aim
- Investigate how different plant communities, defined by functional effects traits, influence carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health on bare chalk.
- Test carbon and nutrient cycling rates across community types.

## Study design and site
- Location: Winklebury Hill chalk grassland.
- Timeframe: March 2013 – September 2016.
- Plot layout: 7 plots across by 6 plots down, total 42 plots; each plot measures 8 m x 8 m with a 2 m gap between plots. Layout spans from the top to the bottom of the slope.
- Experimental approach: full factorial presence/absence of three plant functional groups (FG1, FG2, FG3) across plots, with seven unique combinations replicated across six rows (total 42 plots).
  - This means each row contains all seven combinations (FG1 alone, FG2 alone, FG3 alone, FG1+FG2, FG1+FG3, FG2+FG3, FG1+FG2+FG3).
- Data collected (conceptual): measures of carbon storage in soil, soil fertility, microbial activity, and rates of carbon and nutrient cycling to compare among plant community treatments.

## Plant functional groups (examples)
- FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; large leaves; includes species such as Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
- FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited carbon/nitrogen impact; includes species such as Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
- FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; includes species such as Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
- Note: Each FG comprises a broader list of species beyond the examples provided.

## Drought manipulation (rain shelters)
- From 2015 onward, rain shelters were installed over plots to simulate drought conditions.
- Shelters remained from early June to mid-July to mimic an extreme drought event (once in 100 years).

## GIS and spatial considerations
- The experiment was designed with explicit spatial structure to support map-based data analysis:
  - 42 plots arranged on a slope with defined top/bottom positions.
  - Each plot’s FG combination is spatially mapped in a fixed grid, enabling spatial comparisons and replication.
  - Drought treatment is spatially controlled via location-specific rain shelters, allowing spatial analysis of drought effects across plant communities.

## Key takeaways for data use
- A robust, space-aware design linking plant functional groups to soil carbon and nutrient dynamics on chalk grassland.
- Spatial replication across a 7x6 plot grid provides a strong basis for GIS-based visualization, mapping of treatment effects, and integration with environmental covariates.
- Temporal extension includes drought manipulation starting in 2015, enabling analysis of climate stress responses within different plant community contexts.
