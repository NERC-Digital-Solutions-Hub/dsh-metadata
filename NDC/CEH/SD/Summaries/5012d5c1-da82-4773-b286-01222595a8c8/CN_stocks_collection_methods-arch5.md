# Soil sampling

## Sample collection
- Two soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width augur, as deep as possible.

## Sample processing and storage
- Soil passed through a sieve with 2 mm aperture to remove stones and roots.
- Stones retained were weighed to determine gravel and chalk flint content.
- Soil cores split into 5 cm depth increments.
- Samples dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Dried samples stored at 25 °C until ready for processing.

## Bulk density
- Bulk density (BD) calculated as mass/volume.
- BD adjusted for gravel content using: Adjusted BD = unadjusted BD × (100 − % gravel)/100 (i.e., BD scaled by (1 − % gravel)).

## Carbon and nitrogen analysis
- Each depth fraction ground in a ball mill at 25 s⁻¹ for two minutes.
- Carbonates dissolved by treating with 10% HCl (dropwise) until effervescence ceased.
- Samples redried; 10 ± 0.5 mg used for combustion analysis.
- Analysis performed with an Elementar vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).
- Carbon and nitrogen stocks calculated for each soil depth using standard equations.

## Quality control
- Standards and blanks run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser.
- 5% analytical replicates included.
