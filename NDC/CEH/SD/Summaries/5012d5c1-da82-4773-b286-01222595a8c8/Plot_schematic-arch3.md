# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Aim: Use seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk, then test carbon and nutrient cycling rates and compare these to the characteristics of the plant groups. The study ran from March 2013 to September 2016.
- Plant functional groups (FGs): Three groups of species expected to have similar effects on their surroundings, chosen to predict differences in carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health.
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species (e.g., Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata).
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots (e.g., Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides).
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large, fleshy leaves; rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling and high microbial activity (e.g., Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.).
- Experimental design (growth plots): A full factorial grid of plots (7 across by 6 down) to cover all combinations of the three FGs, replicated six times. Each plot is 8 m x 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
  - Top of slope to bottom of slope labeling and plot numbering indicate the arrangement and replication.
  - Across the grid, every combination of FG1, FG2, and FG3 appears, creating 42 plots in total.
- Timeline and layout details:
  - Initial setup and plantings occurred from 2013 to 2016.
  - A grid approach was used to ensure replicability and enable comparisons across FG combinations.
- Treatments and drought simulation:
  - From 2015 onwards, rain shelters were added to plots to examine the effects of drought.
  - Shelters were deployed from the beginning of June to mid-July to mimic an extreme drought event (once in 100 years) and remained in place for that period.
- Measurements and outcomes:
  - Primary outcomes include carbon storage in soil, nutrient cycling (especially nitrogen), and overall ecosystem health.
  - Comparisons focus on how different plant functional groups influence carbon and nitrogen cycling rates and soil processes.
