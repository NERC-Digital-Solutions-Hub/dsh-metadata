# Soil sampling

- Six soil samples were collected per site using a 4 cm width auger, reaching a depth of 10 cm where possible.
- Samples were sieved (2 mm aperture) to remove stones and roots and stored at 5 °C until processing.

- Bulk density (BD)
  - BD measured from two cores per site at depths 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm; soils dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
  - BD calculated as mass divided by volume.

- Volumetric moisture content
  - 5 ± 0.001 g of fresh soil from each sample dried at 80 °C for 48 hours.
  - Post-drying weight recorded; moisture content calculated as a proportion of the wet weight.

- Water extractable N and C
  - 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 ml Milli-Q water, shaken at 150 rpm for 1 h; filtered through Whatman No. 1.
  - Undiluted filtrate analyzed for DIN (NH4+, NO3-, total N) via autoanalyser with UV digester; DOC measured with TOC analyser.
  - Extracts corrected for soil moisture: DIN/DOC mg/kg = (raw value × (water content + extract volume) × dilution factor) / dry soil weight.

- KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
  - 5 g soil shaken with 25 ml 1 M KCl for 1 h; filtered; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for DIN (NH4+, NO3-) via autoanalyser.
  - Moisture-corrected DIN mg/kg using the same correction approach as above.
  - A second 5 g sample was incubated at 25 °C for 14 days, then extracted and analyzed as above.
  - Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × BD ÷ number of days → g m^-2 day^-1.

- Microbial biomass
  - 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform in a desiccator (24 h) to lyse microbes; a parallel unfumigated sample retained.
  - Nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken, filtered.
  - Filtrate analyzed for DIN and extractable PO4; dissolved carbon measured by TOC-L at the same dilutions.
  - Data adjusted for water content; extraction efficiency corrected with KE = 0.35 (fumigated) and KEN = 0.54 (unfumigated).

- Data processing and calculation notes
  - All nutrient concentrations are adjusted for soil moisture content and extract/dilution factors.
  - Depths 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm are treated separately where measurements were taken from paired cores.
  - Mineralisation and microbial biomass values are derived from standard fumigation-extraction and incubation approaches, with unit conversions to per-area metrics as specified.

- Outputs and units (key variables)
  - Bulk density (g cm^-3) by depth (0–5 cm, 5–10 cm)
  - Volumetric moisture content (dimensionless fraction)
  - Water-extractable DIN (NH4+, NO3-, total N) and DOC (mg/kg)
  - KCl-extractable DIN (NH4+, NO3-) (mg/kg) and mineralisation rate (g m^-2 d^-1)
  - Microbial biomass C and N (via fumigation-extraction) and dissolved carbon (mg/L or related units, as measured)
  - All values corrected for water content and relevant dilution factors; data linked to sample depth and site.
