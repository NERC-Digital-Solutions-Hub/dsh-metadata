Soil sampling

- Sampling procedure
  - Two soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm width auger, aiming to sample as deep as possible.
  - Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
  - Retained stones weighed to determine the proportion of gravel and chalk flints.
  - Soil cores divided into 5 cm depth increments.
  - Samples dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving, then stored at 25 °C until processing.

- Bulk density
  - Bulk density (BD) calculated as mass divided by volume.
  - BD adjusted for gravel content using an adjustment factor (Adjusted BD = unadjusted BD × (100 − % gravel) / 100).

- Carbon and nitrogen analysis
  - Each depth fraction ground in a ball mill (25 s−1 for 2 minutes).
  - Carbonates removed with 10% HCl until effervescence ceased.
  - Samples redried; approximately 10 ± 0.5 mg used for combustion analysis.
  - Analysis performed on an Elementar Vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with acetanilide (10.45% N, 71.4% C).
  - Carbon and nitrogen stocks calculated for each depth from the combustion data and corresponding soil mass.

- Quality control
  - Standards and blanks run every 20 samples on the analyser.
  - 5% analytical replicates included.
