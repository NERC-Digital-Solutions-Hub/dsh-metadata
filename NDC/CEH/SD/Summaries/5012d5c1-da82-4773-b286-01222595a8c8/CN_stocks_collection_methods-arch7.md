# Soil sampling

## Procedures and Sampling
- Two soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width auger, as deep as possible.
- Soil passed through a sieve with 2 mm aperture to remove stones and roots.
- Retained stones weighed to determine the proportion of gravel and chalk flints.
- Soil cores split into 5 cm depth increments; dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Cores stored at 25 °C until processing.

## Bulk Density
- Soil weighed; bulk density (BD) calculated as mass/volume.
- BD adjusted for gravel incursions using: Adjusted BD = (unadjusted BD) × (100 − % gravel) / 100.

## Carbon and Nitrogen Analysis
- Each depth fraction ground in a ball mill at 25 s⁻¹ for 2 minutes.
- Carbonates dissolved with 10% HCl by dropwise addition until effervescence ceased; samples redried.
- Approximately 10 ± 0.5 mg used for combustion analysis.
- Analysis performed on an Elementar vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).
- Carbon and nitrogen stocks calculated for each depth fraction.

## Quality Control
- Standards and blanks run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser.
- 5% analytical replicates included.
