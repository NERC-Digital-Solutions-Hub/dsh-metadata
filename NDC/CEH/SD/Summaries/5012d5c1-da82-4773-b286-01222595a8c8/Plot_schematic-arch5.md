# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Aim
- Use seeds and plug plants to establish different plant communities on bare chalk at Winklebury Hill.
- Test resulting carbon and nutrient cycling rates and compare with characteristics of the plant groups (functional effects traits).

## Study design and timeline
- Experimental period: March 2013 to September 2016.
- Plant groups defined by Functional Effects Traits (FG1, FG2, FG3) to represent distinct influences on carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health.
- FG characteristics:
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species; predicted high soil carbon storage.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; minor contribution to carbon and nitrogen cycling.
  - FG3: Large plants with shallow, thin roots and big fleshy leaves; rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; potentially lower soil carbon storage due to fast turnover.
- Treatments created by combining FG1, FG2, FG3 to form plots with different functional group compositions.

## Plant functional groups and species
- Three functional groups (FG1, FG2, FG3) composed of numerous plant species listed in the study.
- Example species per FG include:
  - FG1: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata, Achillea millefolium, Agrostis spp., Festuca spp., many others.
  - FG2: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides, Glaucous to various grasses and forbs.
  - FG3: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp., Festuca pratensis, Poa spp., etc.
- The study used a comprehensive species list to populate each FG.

## Plot layout and replication
- Plot grid: 42 plots arranged 7 across by 6 down on the slope.
- Each plot: 8 m x 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
- All combinations of FG1, FG2, FG3 represented across the grid; treatments replicated six times.
- Plot labeling and arrangement described to ensure full factorial coverage of FG combinations.

## Data collection and variables
- Primary outcomes: carbon storage in soil, nitrogen cycling, and overall soil fertility and ecosystem health.
- Ancillary data: plant community composition by FG, species-level presence/absence within plots, and potential temporal changes during the study period.
- Timeframe: continuous data collection from 2013 through 2016.

## Rain shelter/drought treatment
- From 2015 onward, rain shelters added to plots to simulate drought conditions.
- Shelters were deployed from early June to mid-July, modeling an extreme drought scenario (once in 100 years).

## Data governance considerations for data stewards
- Metadata and documentation: capture detailed metadata for plot position (top vs bottom slope), FG composition, species lists, and drought treatment status.
- Data structure: organize datasets to reflect the factorial FG combinations, replicate blocks, plot coordinates, and treatment timelines (including drought periods).
- Data quality and provenance: track establishment dates, any changes to FG compositions, and updates to drought treatment with clear versioning.
- Accessibility and sharing: determine appropriate data sharing plan, potential embargo periods, and data formats that support reuse (e.g., standardized soil carbon and nitrogen metrics, species inventories).
- Documentation of limitations: note any gaps due to plot-level disturbances or incomplete species establishment that could affect interpretation of carbon and nutrient cycling results.

## Challenges and considerations
- Managing a large, complex dataset across many plots, species, and treatments.
- Ensuring timely data capture from multiple plots and integrating plant and soil measurements.
- Aligning data from different systems or formats when updating metadata and datasets.
- Handling non-interoperable legacy data from diverse plant groups and treatment records.
