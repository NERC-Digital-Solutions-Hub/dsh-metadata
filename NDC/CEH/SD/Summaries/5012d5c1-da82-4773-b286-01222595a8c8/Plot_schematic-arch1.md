# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Aim
- Use seeds and plug plants to establish different plant communities on bare chalk at Winklebury Hill.
- Test how plant communities influence carbon and nutrient cycling rates and compare them to the traits of the plant groups.
- Run from March 2013 to September 2016.

## Plant functional groups (FG) and expected effects
- Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves. Includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
  - Predictions: higher soil carbon storage with roots delivering carbon deeper into the soil.
  - Example species: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
- Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
  - Predictions: limited carbon and nitrogen cycling due to small size.
  - Example species: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
- Group 3: Large plants with shallow, thin roots and large fleshy leaves.
  - Predictions: very fast carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential reduced long-term carbon storage due to rapid turnover.
  - Example species: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

## Experimental design and plot layout
- Created a grid of plots: 7 across by 6 down, with each plot 8 m × 8 m and 2 m spacing between plots.
- Each plot contains a unique combination of the three FG groups; every possible combination is included across the grid.
- The arrangement was replicated six times.
- Plot labels indicate FG combinations and position along the slope (top to bottom).

## Treatments and drought introduction
- From 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to plots to simulate drought conditions.
- Shelters were in place from early June to mid-July, mimicking an extreme drought (once in 100 years).

## Species lists and plot composition
- A comprehensive species pool is associated with each FG, with numerous species allocated to FG1, FG2, and FG3.
- The design emphasizes functional-trait grouping to assess how different root architectures and leaf traits influence soil carbon, nitrogen cycling, and overall ecosystem health.

## Timeline and data collection intent
- Study period spans March 2013 to September 2016.
- Primary measurements focused on carbon storage, soil nutrient (nitrogen) cycling, and ecosystem health as linked to FG traits.
- Drought treatment introduced mid-study to assess climate-stress responses.

## Data and analysis considerations for analysts
- Experimental structure: multi-factor design with FG group combinations (three factors), slope position, and drought treatment (present/absent) as key factors; six replicated plots per combination.
- Potential data types: plots-level carbon storage metrics, soil carbon and nitrogen pools, microbial activity indicators, plant biomass, and possibly root traits.
- Data challenges and considerations:
  - Complex species compositions within plots; need to map trait-level effects rather than solely species-level effects.
  - Standardization across plots and time points; ensuring consistent sampling protocols for carbon and nutrient measurements.
  - Handling spatial layout and slope effects in analyses; accounting for replicated blocks.
- Suggested analyses:
  - Compare carbon storage and nitrogen cycling across FG groups, including interaction with drought treatment.
  - Use mixed-effects models with plot as a random effect and FG combination, drought, and time as fixed effects.
  - Explore trait-based aggregates (e.g., root depth, leaf litter quality) to explain observed soil processes.
  - Investigate potential lag effects between community establishment and measured soil responses.

## Endnotes and implications
- The Winklebury Hill experiment is designed to reveal how plant functional traits govern carbon retention, soil fertility, and ecosystem dynamics under climatological stress (drought).
- The grid layout and drought treatment enable examination of both main effects and interactions between plant traits and water availability, with a robust replication framework to support statistical inference.
