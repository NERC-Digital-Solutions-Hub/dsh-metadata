# Soil sampling

- Two soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width auger, sampling as deep as possible.
- Samples were passed through a 2 mm aperture sieve to remove stones and roots; stones retained were weighed to determine the proportion of gravel and chalk flints.
- Soil cores were split into 5 cm depth increments, dried at 80°C for 48 hours after sieving, and stored at 25°C until processing.

## Bulk density

- Soil was weighed and bulk density (BD) was calculated as mass divided by volume.
- BD was adjusted for gravel contributions using a correction: adjusted BD = unadjusted BD × (1 − % gravel/100).

## Carbon and nitrogen analysis

- Each depth fraction was ground in a ball mill at 25 s⁻¹ for 2 minutes.
- Carbonates from chalk were dissolved by treating with 10% HCl dropwise until effervescence ceased.
- Samples were redried, and 10 ± 0.5 mg was used for combustion analysis.
- Analyses were performed on an Elementar vario EL combustion analyser, calibrated with an acetanilide standard (10.45% N, 71.4% C).
- Carbon and nitrogen stocks were calculated for each soil depth from the measured C and N contents (per-depth stocks derived from depth fraction data and bulk density).

## Quality control

- Standards and blanks were run every 20 samples on the combustion analyser.
- Analytical replicates of 5% were included.
