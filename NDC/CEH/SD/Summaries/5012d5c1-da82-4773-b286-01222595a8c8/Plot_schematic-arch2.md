# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Aim
- Use seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk.
- Test resulting carbon and nutrient cycling rates and compare them to the characteristics of the plant groups (functional effects traits).
- Determine how plant group composition influences carbon storage, soil fertility, and overall ecosystem health.
- Timeframe: March 2013 to September 2016.

## Plant functional effect groups (FG)
- Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species (examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata).
- Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited above-ground presence; limited carbon/nitrogen cycling (examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides).
- Group 3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots; large leaves; fast carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential for lower long-term carbon storage (examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.).
- Each group comprises a range of species; a broader list of species is provided to define group membership.

## Experimental design and plot layout
- Field site: Winklebury Hill on bare chalk.
- Plot layout: 7 plots across the slope and 6 plots down the slope, forming a grid; each plot measures 8 m x 8 m with a 2 m gap between plots.
- Design: full factorial arrangement of the three plant groups (FG1, FG2, FG3) across plots, with each combination replicated six times.
- Plot coding: combinations of FG2, FG3, FG1, FG1&2, FG1&3, FG2&3, FG1&2&3 (as applicable) distributed across the grid to ensure replication and coverage. Plot labeling mentions top and bottom slope positioning.

## Treatments and replication
- Treatments consist of all combinations of the three functional groups (FG1, FG2, FG3) applied to plots.
- Replication: six replicates of each treatment combination to enable comparison and statistical analysis across the gradient (slope position and treatment).

## Data collection and outcomes
- Primary outcomes: carbon storage in soil, carbon and nitrogen cycling rates, microbial activity in soil, and overall ecosystem health indicators.
- Analytical approach: relate observed ecosystem processes to the functional traits of the plant groups to infer how composition shapes environmental conditions.

## Drought experiment (rain shelters)
- From 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to plots to investigate the effect of drought.
- Shelter period: from the beginning of June to mid-July, simulating an extreme drought event (approximately once in 100 years).

## Overall significance
- The study design enables assessment of how different plant functional trait groups influence carbon and nutrient dynamics in a chalk grassland context.
- The combination of a full factorial design, slope gradient coverage, and drought manipulation provides insights into how plant community composition and water stress interact to affect environmental health and ecosystem processes.
