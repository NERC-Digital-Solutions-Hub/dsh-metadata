# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020

- A user guide for UKCEH Land Cover Map 2020 (LCM2020), the eighth UK land cover map produced by UKCEH.
- Product comprises six datasets distributed across GB and Northern Ireland: for each region, a 10m Classified Pixels dataset, a Classified Land Parcels dataset, and a 25m Pixel Rasterised Land Parcel dataset.
- Aims to enable informed decision-making about land cover and change through a consistent, time-aware data product.

## Purpose and scope

- Provides description of data production, validation, and accuracy to support appropriate use in current and future work.
- LCM2020 maps land cover into 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes derived from Biodiversity Broad Habitats (BAP) but not identical to BAP Broad Habitats.
- Intended for monitoring environment state and change with a focus on annual production and temporal consistency for change detection.

## Product suite and dataset descriptions

- 10m Classified Pixel datasets ( GB and Northern Ireland):
  - Pixels classified into UKCEH Land Cover Classes; first band = class identifier, second band = class membership probability (confidence).
  - Not generalised by the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine landscape details.
- Classified Land Parcel datasets:
  - Generated by intersecting 10m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - Include parcel-level attributes (e.g., hist, mode, conf, purity, n) and identifiers; designed to support noise reduction and change detection over time.
  - Geography: GB uses EPSG:27700; NI uses EPSG:29903; thousands of parcels per region.
- 25m Pixel Rasterised Land Parcel datasets:
  - Rasterised from Land Parcel datasets to 25m pixels; three-band rasters per parcel: dominant land cover class (_mode), mean confidence (_conf), and purity (_purity).
- 20m Classified Raster Product (GB and NI described in Appendix):
  - Additional 20m classified outputs for specialist use (noted in dataset list).
- Seasonality and context data:
  - Seasonal Composite Images derived from Sentinel-2 (winter, spring, summer, autumn) to form Classification Scenes.
  - 10 Context Rasters per region (GB: terrain, proximity to buildings/roads/sea/freshwater, foreshore, tidal water, urban/woodland masks; NI: height/aspect/slope, urban mask, distances to coast/freshwater/road).
- Classification Scenes:
  - GB uses 100x100 km tiles to extract 36-band Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composites plus 10 Context rasters, forming 46-band GB Classification Scenes; 74 overlapping scenes classified independently with manual precedence for final cut.
  - NI uses a single 100x100 km tile per year, with 36-band Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images plus NI Context Rasters, forming a 43-band NI Classification Scene.
- UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework:
  - Maintains parcels as discrete, real-world units (min ~0.5 ha MMU) to reduce noise and enable robust change detection.
  - Note: gid identifiers do not match those from LCM2015 due to reorganisation for faster processing.

## Methodology and production approach

- Bootstrap Training:
  - Fully automatic training process that sources training observations from historic land maps (LCM2017–2019) to avoid costly field data collection.
  - Training data filtered to parcels with >99% purity across three years; results in large, balanced training sets (GB: 941,027; NI: 214,833).
- Random Forest classification:
  - Pixels sampled in labelled bags (10,000 samples per bag, with replacement) to train the RF model.
  - Balances classes to prevent dominance by common classes; yields per-pixel class and confidence.
  - Software uses a bespoke pipeline integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL (open source).
- Data quality and validation:
  - Validation against GB countryside survey (2019/2020), open National Forest Inventory data, IACS data, and bespoke validation points (34715 points in total).
  - Overall accuracy for LCM2020: 79.2% (full thematic detail; Appendix 4).

## Data interpretation and usage considerations

- Relationship to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats:
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are closely related to BAP Broad Habitats but are not identical; BAP classes may be broader or differently defined for fieldwork vs. satellite mapping.
  - Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 provide guidance on how UKCEH Land Cover Classes map to BAP Broad Habitats, including examples and potential confusions.
- Data presentation and accessibility:
  - General guidance on using 10m pixel data for detailed mapping vs. 25m parcel-based outputs for robust, aggregated analyses.
  - Spatial and thematic consistency emphasized to support change detection over time and cross-year comparisons.
- Temporal considerations:
  - Annual production helps separate random classification noise from real change; most errors are spatially/temporally random and should flicker across years rather than persist identically at fixed locations.

## Practical details for analysts monitoring the environment

- Data structure and formats:
  - 10m Classified Pixels: two-band outputs (class ID, conf) per region.
  - Land Parcels: parcel-level attributes with detailed statistics and metadata; unique parcel IDs, cross-year comparability caveats noted.
  - 25m Rasterised Parcel outputs: per-parcel dominant class, mean conf, and purity.
- Quality and applicability:
  - Overall thematic accuracy ~79.2%; users should consider local validation for critical applications.
  - The 10m pixels preserve narrow features; the 25m parcels provide simplified, noise-reduced continuity suitable for regional analyses.
- Data lineage and comparability:
  - Bootstrap Training relies on historic LCM data (2017–2019); cross-year comparisons should account for potential classification differences and evolving training data.
  - Parcel identifiers do not align with LCM2015 due to framework updates.
