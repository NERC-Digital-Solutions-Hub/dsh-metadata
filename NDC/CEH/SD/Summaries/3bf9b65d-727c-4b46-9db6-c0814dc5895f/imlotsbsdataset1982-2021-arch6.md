# The dataset:

- This dataset contains calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies (Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake, and northern fulmar).
- Annual breeding success is measured as the number of chicks fledged per active nest; each year is a single row with six columns for breeding success rates (one per species, labeled by common name and suffixed 'BS') and six columns for the number of active nests used to calculate the rates.
- Timeframe: puffin, guillemot, and razorbill data start in 1982; shag, kittiwake, and fulmar data start in 1987.
- The dataset is free to use under a UKCEH data licence; authors encourage contacting UKCEH staff before publication.
- Background: part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) within the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee’s seabird monitoring programme; methods have been standardised since 1987.
- Data collection context: field measurements were conducted by trained staff following defined protocols; notebooks and field data sheets were transcribed to spreadsheets, with consistency checks against field observations; all materials archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.
- Data quality and storage: all databases are quality-controlled at source with error-checking queries in Access to verify uncertain information; regular backups and adherence to project objectives are tracked through UKCEH management.
- Outputs and dissemination: outputs are vetted against contracted deliverables; non-confidential scientific information is encouraged for publication with customer approval and acknowledgement.
- Appendix provides method extracts used to obtain the dataset for each species’ productivity monitoring.

## Data structure and contents

- Rows: one per year.
- Columns: six breeding success rate columns (one per species, labeled with common name + BS) and six corresponding active nest counts.
- Species and start years:
  - Puffin, Guillemot, Razorbill: data from 1982 onward.
  - Shag, Kittiwake, Fulmar: data from 1987 onward.

## Field methods and species-specific approaches (summary)

- Fulmar productivity-monitoring: nest-site mapping on photographs; multiple plots; use consistent plots each year; record incubation and fledging outcomes; express productivity as mean fledged young per occupied site.
- Shag productivity-monitoring: plot-based sampling; reproduce and monitor nests every 7–10 days; record nest state and incubation/brooding; productivity as total fledged chicks per incubating nests.
- Kittiwake productivity-monitoring: 50–100 nests per plot; photograph plots; mark incubating/attending nests; reassess on later visits; estimate fledging by chick age classes; productivity as fledged chicks per completed nest.
- Guillemot productivity-monitoring: multiple plots with >=50 breeding pairs; photograph incubating sites; frequent visits to track eggs and chicks; productivity as total fledged chicks per active site.
- Razorbill productivity-monitoring: similar plot-based approach as Guillemot; focus on active sites and chick outcomes; productivity as fledged chicks per active site.
- Puffin productivity-monitoring: burrow checks post-peak laying; use sticks to detect incubating birds; re-check before fledging; determine success by presence of chicks; productivity as fledged chicks per refound burrow.

## Usage and access

- Suitable for researchers and practitioners aiming to analyze long-term breeding success trends or to create data products for exploration (dashboards, reports).
- Data handling follows rigorous QA, with opportunities to contact UKCEH for licensing questions and publication coordination.
