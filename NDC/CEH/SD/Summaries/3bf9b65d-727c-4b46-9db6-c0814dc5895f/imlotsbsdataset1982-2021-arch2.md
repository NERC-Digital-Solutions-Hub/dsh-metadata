# The dataset

## Overview
- A dataset of calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species at representative Isle of May colonies (East coast of Scotland).
- Annual breeding success defined as chicks fledged per active nest.
- Six species represented with breeding success (BS) columns and six corresponding active nest counts.
- Data span begins in the 1980s (species-specific start years) and are intended for long-term environmental monitoring.
- Free to use under UKCEH data licence; authors encourage prior contact for publications.

## Dataset content
- Rows: one per year.
- Columns: six breeding success rates (one per species, labeled by common name with suffix BS) and six counts of active nests used to calculate those rates.

## Data provenance and monitoring context
- Part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), a component of the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) seabird monitoring programme.
- Standardised methods for calculating breeding success have been in use since 1987.
- Fieldwork conducted by trained staff following defined protocols; data documented in notebooks and field sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets and archived.

## Field methods and data handling (highlights)
- Data capture:
  - Field notebooks and field data sheets; subsequent transcription to spreadsheets.
  - Cross-checks for inconsistencies against field records; field verifications performed as needed.
- Data management:
  - Data quality controlled at source using error-checking queries in Access databases.
  - Files backed up to UKCEH directories; notebooks/fieldsheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.
- Output governance:
  - Results vetted for integrity and alignment with deliverables; reports/maps/charts produced for dissemination.
  - Encouragement for non-confidential publication in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.

## Appendix: monitoring methods (productivity approaches by species)
- Fulmar productivity (nest-site mapping)
  - Plot selection, repeated annually; random/dispersed plots; nest-site marking and photography.
  - Regular checks (late May/early June for lay, August for chick presence).
  - Productivity expressed as mean fledged per occupied site.
- Shag productivity
  - Bedrock cliff/rock/boulder sites; 7–10 day visits from laying to fledging.
  - Multiple plots; yearly plotting with overlays; nest state and contents recorded.
  - Productivity as chicks fledged per incubating nests.
- Kittiwake productivity
  - 50–100 nest plots; aerial photography with overlays; regular visits through May–June.
  - Nests categorized by incubation/brooding status; fledging assessed after first chick sighting.
  - Productivity as fledged chicks per completed nest.
- Guillemot productivity
  - Several plots with ≥50 breeding pairs; incubation-period monitoring with regular checks.
  - Active sites mapped from photographs; chicks’ age and presence tracked.
  - Productivity as total fledged per active/inactive but regular sites.
- Razorbill productivity
  - Similar approach to Guillemot with plots of at least 10 breeding pairs; regular checks and age-based fledging assessment.
- Puffin productivity
  - Post-peak laying checks in burrows; four plots of 50+ burrows; use probing sticks to detect incubation.
  - Re-checks as chicks grow; success defined by presence of chicks at burrows.

## Data usage and access
- Outputs used for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Datasets are integrated into standard monitoring workflows and portals; reduction to summary metrics informs conservation decisions.
- Data can be enhanced by linking with other environmental datasets to increase value beyond single-use analyses.

## Considerations for analysts
- Long-term, standardized time series enable trend analyses and policy evaluation.
- Methodological consistency since 1987 supports comparability across years and species.
- Potential for data integration with broader environmental datasets to improve context and insight.
- Access considerations: public-use licensing with a note to contact UKCEH for publications and collaboration.
