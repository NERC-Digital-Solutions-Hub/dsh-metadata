# The dataset

## Overview
- Contains calculated breeding success rates (BS) for six seabird species at representative Isle of May colonies: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake, and northern fulmar.
- Breeding success defined as the number of chicks fledged per active nest; annual data are represented as single rows with six BS columns and six columns for the number of active nests (one pair of columns per species for BS and active nests, respectively).
- Time coverage: puffin, guillemot, razorbill since 1982; shag, kittiwake, fulmar since 1987.
- Dataset is free to use under a UKCEH data licence; users are encouraged to contact UKCEH staff before publication.

## Provenance and context
- Originates from the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), part of the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) seabird monitoring programme.
- Breeding success calculation methods are described in the Appendix and have been consistent since standardisation began in 1987.
- Field data were collected by experienced staff under defined protocols and archived at UKCEH.

## Data structure and composition
- Each year contains six BS values (one per species) and six corresponding counts of active nests used to calculate BS.
- The dataset reflects long-term, standardized seabird monitoring with species-specific plot counts and sampling schemes described below.

## Field measurements and data handling
- Data collection: notebooks and field data sheets; later transcribed to spreadsheets; checks against inconsistencies conducted in the field and during transcription.
- Data quality: all field and database inputs are quality controlled at source; error-checking queries in Access databases enable verification and correction of uncertain information.
- Data management: field notebooks and sheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh; datasets are tracked and vetted within UKCEH governance.

## Output and dissemination
- Results, reports, and progress are subject to management vetting and tracking within UKCEH.
- UKCEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.
- Data and datasets are made discoverable via portals with metadata.

## Appendix: seabird productivity monitoring methods (highlights by species)
- Fulmar productivity-monitoring method
  - Use nest-site mapping on selected plots; 3–5+ plots preferred; map and photograph plots; mark nest-sites on overlays.
  - Conduct three visits in late May/early June; record activity at each potential nest site; sample size based on plots (mean fledged per occupied site per plot).
  - Express colony production as mean number of young fledged per regularly occupied site.
- Shag productivity-monitoring method
  - Visit colonies every 7–10 days from start of laying; select multiple plots (10–30 nests per plot; 3–5 plots preferred); photograph plots; record nest state and presence of incubating birds.
  - Colony production = total fledged young divided by nests where birds were definitely or probably incubating.
- Kittiwake productivity-monitoring method
  - Identify 50–100 nest plots viewable safely; photograph plots; use overlays to mark nests and statuses.
  - Visits in late May and mid-June to classify incubating/attended nests; re-check on subsequent visits.
  - After first chick appears, record fledging status; productivity = fledged chicks divided by completed nests.
- Guillemot productivity-monitoring method
  - Select several plots (at least five of 50 breeding pairs); use photographs of incubating birds; map active sites.
  - Perform multiple visits daily around incubation; track egg laying, loss, relaying, hatching, and chick presence.
  - Productivity = total active sites (eggs/chicks or incubating adults on consecutive checks) divided by sample size of plots.
- Razorbill productivity-monitoring method
  - Similar to Guillemot: multiple plots, photographs, and repeated visits; record active sites and chick presence from incubation onward.
  - Productivity calculation mirrors Guillemot approach.
- Puffin productivity-monitoring method
  - Check burrows after peak laying (early May); mark four plots with 50+ burrows each.
  - Use sticks to probe burrows for incubation status; re-check in early July before fledging.
  - Determine success by presence of chicks or evidence (latrine, moulted down); compute success as chicks present divided by refound burrows.
