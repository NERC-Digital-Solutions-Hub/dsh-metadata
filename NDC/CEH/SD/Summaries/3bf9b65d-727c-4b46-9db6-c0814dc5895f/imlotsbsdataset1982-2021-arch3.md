# The dataset:

- Six seabird species breeding success rates at representative Isle of May colonies off eastern Scotland, with annual breeding success defined as chicks fledged per active nest.
- Yearly data are stored as rows; six columns for each species’ breeding success (BS) and six columns for the number of active nests used to calculate BS.
- The dataset is free to use under a UKCEH data licence, but users are encouraged to contact UKCEH staff beforehand, especially for publications.

## Overview and purpose for monitoring authors

- Part of a long-running seabird monitoring effort linked to the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) and the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) seabird monitoring programme.
- Methods and calculations for breeding success have been standardized since 1987, with continuous data collection and quality control.
- Data are collected, curated, and released with governance: field protocols, data handling, and reporting are defined to meet objectives and contractual outputs.

## Background and longitudinal context

- IMLOTS initiated seabird studies in 1973; Isle of May monitoring became standardized across species from 1987.
- Species-specific histories include planned plot increases or adjustments in response to population changes:
  - Puffin: monitoring since 1973; four plots since 1982.
  - Guillemot and Razorbill: monitoring since 1982, with incremental plot changes.
  - Shag: monitoring since 1987; plots expanded over time (1996, 2017) to address declines.
  - Kittiwake: monitoring since 1987; plots expanded in 2004–2005 due to population changes.
  - Fulmar: monitoring since 1987; initial plots around ten.

## Field measurements and data handling

- Fieldwork performed by trained staff following defined protocols; data recorded in notebooks and field sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets.
- Data checks are performed to identify inconsistencies (e.g., hatchings and fledging dates), with in-field verification of potential errors.
- Notebooks and field sheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.
- Databases undergo quality control at source; Access databases include error-checking queries to validate uncertain information.

## Output, governance, and dissemination

- Results, report quality, alignment with contracted deliverables, and timeliness are vetted and tracked by UKCEH management.
- Encouragement for staff to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature, subject to customer approval and acknowledgement.
- Metadata considerations and data governance are integral to sharing underlying data appropriately.

## Appendix: Monitoring methods by species (summary of methods described in user manuals)

- Fulmar productivity-monitoring method (nest-site mapping)
  - Map large colonies using plots containing 30–50 nest-sites; prefer 3–5 plots, dispersed and viewable safely.
  - Use repeated annual plots; photograph plots with overlays to locate and code nest positions.
  - Conduct three visits in late May/early June; record activity at each nest and whether incubating.
  - Express colony production as mean fledged young per regularly occupied site; report as chicks per nest incubating.

- Shag productivity-monitoring method
  - Use seabird plots (10–30 nests) across colonies; aim for 3–5 plots; same plots used each season.
  - Visit every 7–10 days from start of laying; record nest state, contents, and incubation/brooding.
  - Express colony production as total fledged young divided by nests where birds were incubating.

- Kittiwake productivity-monitoring method
  - Identify 50–100 nests across dispersed plots; typically 50–70 nests per photograph.
  - Photograph plots in May; overlay plot boundaries and nest positions; visit in late May and mid-June.
  - On initial visits, mark nests with incubating birds, attended nests, and other relevant states.
  - On subsequent visits, re-check and include any new nests; after first chick is seen, record fledging indicators.
  - Productivity is chicks fledged divided by completed nests.

- Guillemot productivity-monitoring method
  - Select several plots (at least five) with 50+ breeding pairs each; view from consistent vantage points.
  - Take incubating-phase photographs; delineate active sites on large prints; perform multiple daily visits.
  - Record egg laying, loss, relaid, hatching, and chick presence; define sample as active sites and regular inactive sites.
  - Count fledged chicks when they reach 15+ days or are otherwise inferred as fledged.

- Razorbill productivity-monitoring method
  - Similar framework to Guillemot: multiple plots (at least five) with 10+ breeding pairs; photograph and map active sites.
  - Frequent visits from incubation; track eggs, hatching, and chick presence; compute productivity as fledged chicks per active site.

- Puffin productivity-monitoring method
  - Check burrows after peak laying; mark four plots of 50+ burrows each.
  - Use probing sticks to detect incubation and presence of eggs; re-check in early July.
  - Determine success by presence of chicks and final counts, noting predation or flooding; compute productivity as chicks present divided by burrows with determined presence.
