# The dataset:

## Overview
- Dataset of calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species at Isle of May NNR, off the East coast of Scotland.
- Species and timeframes:
  - Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill: data from 1982 onward
  - European shag, black-legged kittiwake, northern fulmar: data from 1987 onward
- Data representation: each year is a single row; six columns contain the breeding success rates (BS) for each species, and six columns contain the number of active nests used to calculate the BS.
- Access and licensing: free to use under a standard UKCEH data licence; authors encourage contacting UKCEH staff before publication.

## Data structure and content
- Primary variables:
  - Breeding success rates (BS) for Puffin, Guillemot, Razorbill, Shag, Kittiwake, and Fulmar
  - Number of active nests used to calculate BS for each species
- Scope: longitudinal yearly observations from Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), part of the JNCC national seabird monitoring programme
- Documentation: methods for calculating BS included; standardised monitoring since 1987

## Provenance and collection processes
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced, trained staff following defined protocols
- Data capture workflow:
  - Field notebooks and data sheets
  - Transcription to spreadsheets
  - Consistency checks against known hatching and fledging dates
  - Field verification of potential errors
- Data management: all notebooks and field sheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh
- Quality control: databases are quality controlled at source; Access databases include error-checking queries

## Sampling design and coverage
- Plot and sampling history by species (sample sizes reflect population monitoring needs):
  - Puffin: 4 plots (since 1982)
  - Guillemot: 4 plots (1982), increasing to 5 in 1983, 6 from 1984 to present
  - Razorbill: 2 plots (1982), increasing to 3 in 1983, 4 in 1984, 5 from 1985 to present
  - Shag: 14 plots (1987), expanded (1996, 2017) to boost sample size due to population decline
  - Kittiwake: 15 plots (1987), expanded in 2004–2005 to boost sample size
  - Fulmar: 10 plots (1987)
- Emphasis on representativeness and consistency across years; standardised methods since 1987

## Methods and appendix highlights
- Appendix provides detailed productivity-monitoring methods used for each species:
  - Fulmar: nest-site mapping, multiple study plots, photographic overlays, three checks per year, productivity as mean fledged per occupied site
  - Shag: periodic visits (every 7–10 days), plot-based sampling, nests monitored, productivity as fledged per incubating nest
  - Kittiwake: plots of 50–100 nests, photography-based mapping, multiple visits, productivity as fledged per completed nest
  - Guillemot: several study plots, incubation-phase mapping, frequent visits, active sites and nests counted, productivity as fledged per active site
  - Razorbill: similar protocol with plots and active sites, frequent checks, productivity as fledged per active site
  - Puffin: burrow checks post-peak laying, multiple plots of 50+ burrows, presence of chicks determined by probing burrows, productivity as chicks fledged per burrow with chick presence determined
- Key concept across species: productivity defined as number of chicks fledged divided by the relevant denominator (e.g., active sites, completed nests)

## Data quality, governance, and publication
- Quality assurance: data quality controlled at source; error-checking queries used in databases
- Reporting: results, reports, and deliverables undergo management vetting and tracking within UKCEH
- Publication policy: staff encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information with customer approval and acknowledgement

## Licensing, access, and usage considerations
- Licensing: dataset free to use under UKCEH data licence
- Publication considerations: authors request contact with UKCEH staff prior to publication to coordinate use and acknowledgment

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Provides a long-term, multi-species productivity dataset linked to a standardized monitoring framework
- Useful for cross-species productivity comparisons, trend analysis, and policy/management decision support
- Offers explicit documentation of sampling design and methods, aiding reproducibility and comparability
- Highlights the importance of metadata, plot-level consistency, and data governance in sustained data assets
