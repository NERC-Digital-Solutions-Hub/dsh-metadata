# The dataset

- Content and scope
  - Calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies (East coast of Scotland).
  - Species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake, northern fulmar.
  - Time span: rates available since 1982 for some species; monitoring extended to 1987 for others.
  - Data structure: each year is a single row; six columns for breeding success rates (one per species, labeled by common name with BS suffix) and six columns for the number of active nests used to calculate each rate.

- Access, licensing, and usage
  - Dataset is free to use, under the standard UKCEH data licence.
  - Authors encourage contacting relevant UKCEH staff before publication or use, especially for publication purposes.

- Provenance and context
  - Part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), aligned with the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee’s seabird monitoring programme.
  - Methods for calculating breeding success standardized since 1987; background details and species-specific monitoring histories provided.

- Data collection and handling process
  - Fieldwork conducted by trained staff according to defined protocols; data captured in notebooks and field data sheets.
  - Data transcribed to spreadsheets; routine checks for inconsistencies against field records; backups maintained in UKCEH directories.
  - Notebooks and data sheets archived at UKCEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases are quality-controlled at source; Access databases include error-checking queries to verify uncertain information.

- Data quality, governance, and outputs
  - Data integrity and reporting quality are subject to management vetting and tracking within UKCEH (via Heads of Sections, Programme Directors, and Finance Administration).
  - Staff encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed outlets with customer approval and acknowledgment.

- Appendix and methodological detail
  - Appendix contains extracts from user manuals describing methods used to obtain the dataset (examples for Fulmar, Shag, Guillemot, Kittiwake, Razorbill, Puffin).
  - Summaries include: plot/plot-size selection, nest-site mapping, sampling regimes, photographic documentation, year-to-year plot consistency, data recording on nest status, fledging age assessments, and colony productivity calculations.
  - Each species has detailed, species-specific productivity-monitoring procedures (e.g., nest-site mapping for fulmars, cliff/rock/boulder nesting for shags, 50-70 nests per print for kittiwakes, burrow checks for puffins).

- Relevance for data stewardship
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: field collection, transcription, quality control, archival storage, and documented methodologies.
  - Includes explicit data structures (rates and counts per year), metadata implications (species, site plots, year), and standardized procedures that support interoperability and reproducibility.
  - Highlights potential governance considerations: licensing, data use permissions for publications, and provenance that can inform data-sharing policies and portal deposition.

- Challenges and considerations for future stewardship
  - Maintaining up-to-date metadata about plots, sampling effort, and any changes in methodology.
  - Managing data updates, embargoes, and cross-team collaboration for publications.
  - Handling multi-species datasets with consistent schema across years and methods, and ensuring long-term accessibility of archived notebooks and field sheets.
