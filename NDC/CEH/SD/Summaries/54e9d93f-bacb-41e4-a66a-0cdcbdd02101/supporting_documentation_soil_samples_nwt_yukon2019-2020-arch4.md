# Environmental context and metadata for permafrost soil samples, NWT & YT, Canada, 2020

## Overview
- Dataset describing carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content in permafrost soil samples from the Northwest Territories and Yukon, Canada, collected in 2019 and 2020.
- Collected by Julian Murton, Thomas Opel, and Steve Kokelj; CN analysis conducted by Nina L. Friggens, with support from Joana Zaragoza-Castells.
- Samples were stored frozen and later processed; CN analyses conducted in June 2021 at the University of Exeter using a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 Elemental Analyser.
- Data product comprises one CSV file: Soil_samples_NWT_Yukon2019-2020.csv (14 columns) and a companion Word document with detailed site-level sampling contexts.
- Intended for documenting CN content in permafrost soils and supporting analyses of carbon and nitrogen stocks, as well as palaeoenvironmental reconstruction around the Tuk Harbour region.

## Data structure and content
- Data file: Soil_samples_NWT_Yukon2019-2020.csv
- Columns: 14 total, describing sample identity, description, location, depth, date, mass, C content (%), N content (%), sampling method, storage, and related metadata (as detailed in the documentation).
- Sample identifiers follow a systematic code (e.g., 19-001-EC-P1) indicating year, sample number, location, and profile.
- The accompanying Word document provides extended descriptions of sampling locations, environmental context, procedures, and site-specific notes for 14 soil profiles.

## Collection and generation methods
- Sampling scope: 14 soil profiles across three regions of NWT and Yukon (East Channel - EC; Tuktoyaktuk - T; Klondike - K).
- Four soil profile types sampled:
  - Non-lake orthels
  - Drained thermokarst-lake sediments
  - Turbels (turbels)
  - Yedoma deposits
- Site-specific profiles and designations: #1–#14 with detailed coordinates, dates (August 2019 for most profiles; August 2020 for HUS and CRB_S), geomorphic context, and vegetation descriptions.
- Sampling methods included soil pits, coring, or horizontal drill holes into thaw slumps.
- Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction around Tuk Harbour included in the narrative (time sequence T1–T6) detailing deposition, drainage, ice-wedge development, and polygon formation.

## Analytical methods and quality control
- Sample processing: frozen upon return, shipped to Exeter, defrosted, homogenised, and ground for CN analysis.
- CN analysis: 15 mg per sample weighed and analysed using the Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 Elemental Analyser.
- Quality control: calibration standards using EDTA at the start and as check standards every ten samples; accepted variation criteria for C and N values as part of QC protocol.

## Sample metadata and coding conventions
- Sample coding: year (19 for 2019) + sample number + location abbreviations (EC, T, K) + profile number (P1–P6) and site-specific identifiers (e.g., HUS, CRB_S).
- Geolocation: latitude and longitude provided for each site.
- Depth information: depth below ground surface in meters; multiple depths may be listed per profile.
- Active layer and permafrost status indicators: AL (active layer), Pc (permafrost cryoturbated), Pnc (permafrost non-cryoturbated), etc.
- Vegetation, geomorphic context, and soil descriptions accompany site metadata to support interpretation and reuse.
- The 14 profiles include extensive site-level notes on organic/mineral soil horizons, ALT, ground ice presence, and cryostructure.

## Data access and usage
- Primary data product: Soil_samples_NWT_Yukon2019-2020.csv with CN results.
- Supplementary context: a Word document providing detailed site descriptions, sampling methods, and environmental context for all profiles.
- Potential uses include assessment of soil carbon and nitrogen stocks across permafrost landscapes, comparison across soil types and regions, and integration with palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.

## Considerations for data stewardship and reuse
- Provenance: multiple researchers contributed; CN results produced in 2021 after field collection in 2019–2020.
- Data richness: extensive site- and profile-level metadata enabling stratified analyses; some variability in ALT and ground-ice observations across profiles.
- Limitations: dataset covers specific regions (NWT & Yukon) and a defined set of 14 profiles; results are most suitable for regional-scale or permafrost-ecosystem studies rather than broad generalization.
- Suggested practices: link CN data to the accompanying site metadata, maintain metadata alignment with sample IDs, and reference the Word document for full environmental context when interpreting results.
