# Environmental context and metadata for permafrost soil samples, NWT & YT, Canada, 2020

## Overview
- Reports carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content of permafrost soil samples collected in Northwest Territories (NWT) and Yukon Territory (YT), Canada, in 2019 and 2020.
- Sampling conducted by a team of researchers and processed for CN content at the University of Exeter.
- Data package includes a CSV with CN results and an accompanying Word document detailing site context, soil profiles, and sampling procedures.
- Aims align with environmental monitoring needs: documenting permafrost soil properties to support understanding of carbon stocks and palaeoenvironmental conditions.

## Data structure
- One CSV file: Soil_samples_NWT_Yukon2019-2020.csv containing 14 columns of carbon and nitrogen measurements for each soil sample.
- A separate Word document provides extensive metadata, site context, sampling locations, procedures, and geomorphic settings for 14 soil profiles.
- Data fields cover identifiers, location, depth, date, sample mass, C content, N content, and descriptive metadata.

## Collection and generation methods
- 14 soil profiles sampled across three regions: East Channel (EC) of Mackenzie River, Tuktoyaktuk (T), and Klondike (K).
- Four soil profile types represented:
  - Non-lake orthels
  - Drained thermokarst-lake sediments
  - Turbels (turbid, cryoturbated soils)
  - Yedoma deposits
- Sampling conducted in August 2019 (profiles #1–#14, various sites) and August 2020 (profiles HUS and CRB_S documented in metadata).
- Methods included soil pits, coring, and horizontal drill holes into thaw slumps; in situ measurements of active layer thickness (ALT) and ground ice presence (where observed).
- Detailed site context provided for each profile (coordinates, landscape position, drainage status, vegetation, and geomorphic interpretation).
- Data governance notes: samples were frozen on return, shipped to Exeter, and processed under standardized CN protocols.

## Analytical methods
- CN analysis performed on dried and ground soil using a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 Elemental Analyser.
- About 15 mg of homogenised soil used per analysis; results reported as percent C and percent N.
- Quality control with EDTA standards run at the start and as checks (~every ten samples) to monitor accuracy (N ~9.59%, C ~41.1% with specified acceptance ranges).

## Quality control and data standards
- Frozen storage maintained from field to laboratory processing; homogenisation and careful subsampling ensure consistency.
- Use of standardized analytical protocol (Flash 2000) with EDTA internal standards for QA/QC.
- Metadata captures sampling context (location codes, ALT, ground ice observations, date, sampling method) to enable reproducibility and cross-site comparisons.
- The accompanying metadata document provides rich site-specific descriptions to support data interpretation and validation.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Sample identifiers encode year, sample number, location (EC, T, K), and profile.
- Location fields include latitude and longitude (degrees, minutes, seconds).
- Depth below ground surface recorded in meters.
- Date collected and total sample mass recorded.
- Measured variables include C content (%) and N content (%).
- Descriptions provide qualitative interpretations (e.g., active layer status, permafrost conditions, soil type).
- Sampling method and storage details documented to support traceability and data governance.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Provides baseline CN data for permafrost soils across diverse geomorphic contexts, enabling assessment of carbon stocks and potential climate feedbacks.
- Rich metadata and site descriptions support comparability across regions and over time, informing monitoring strategies and policy decisions.
- Demonstrates a workflow for integrating field sampling, laboratory CN analysis, and metadata documentation—critical for transparent monitoring frameworks.
- Highlights need for standardized data formats, complete metadata, and accessible data sharing to overcome fragmentation and facilitate governance.

## Challenges and governance considerations
- Variable data density and completeness across sites (e.g., some profiles with limited ground-ice observations or ALT measurements).
- Complex permafrost heterogeneity (cryoturbation, ice wedges, loessal deposits) requiring careful interpretation and documentation.
- Data access and openness; while data are generated for research, governance implications stress the importance of openly sharing underlying data while maintaining quality and provenance.
- Ensuring metadata completeness (site context, sampling methods, and QA/QC procedures) is essential for effective monitoring and policy use.
