# Soil_samples_NWT_Yukon2019-2020.csv

- Dataset documenting carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content in permafrost soils collected from the Northwest Territories and Yukon, Canada, in 2019 and 2020.
- Structure: a single CSV file named Soil_samples_NWT_Yukon2019-2020.csv containing 14 columns; an accompanying Word document provides detailed site descriptions, environment, and procedures.
- Principal contributors: field collection by Julian Murton, Thomas Opel, and Steve Kokelj; CN analysis by Nina L. Friggens with Joana Zaragoza-Castells; data context and metadata by the project team.
- Purpose: to enable analysis of C and N content across diverse permafrost soils, support correlations with soil type, permafrost state, active layer depth, and paleoenvironmental history; useful for carbon/nitrogen budgeting in northern landscapes.

## Data structure and contents

- File: Soil_samples_NWT_Yukon2019-2020.csv with 14 columns describing each soil sample.
- Columns (high-level): sample code, description, soil type, active layer vs permafrost designation (AL, ALc, Pc, Pnc), latitude, longitude, depth below ground surface (m), date collected, total sample mass (kg), short description, sampling method, storage during fieldwork, C content (%), N content (%).
- Example sampling context: 14 soil profiles labeled #1–#14, spanning four geomorphic groupings (orthel, turbel, histel, and loessal/depositional settings) across three regions:
  - East Channel (EC) of Mackenzie River
  - Tuktoyaktuk (T)
  - Klondike (K)
- Key measurements per profile: active layer depth (ALT) values (often determined by probing or soil section measurements), presence/absence of ground ice, and notes on cryoturbation or buried horizons.
- Additional context: a Word document with detailed descriptions of sampling locations, environment, procedures, and paleoenvironmental reconstructions accompanies the dataset.

## Collection and context

- Timeframe: August 2019 (most profiles) and August 2020 (HUS and CRB_S profiles near Tuk Harbour).
- Terrain and soil types represented:
  - Non-lake orthels on alluvium
  - Drained thermokarst-lake sediments
  - Turbels over till and organic silt
  - Yedoma-derived deposits
- Profiles include detailed geomorphic contexts, vegetation, organic/mineral soil characteristics, ALT, ground ice presence, and sampling approach (soil pits, core holes, vertical sections).
- Paleoenvironmental reconstruction around Tuk Harbour outlines a sequence from grey sand deposition to lake formation and drainage, ice-wedge development, and polygonal ground evolution.

## Analytical methods and quality control

- Sample handling: frozen in field; shipped frozen to University of Exeter; thawed, homogenised; ~10 g subsamples oven-dried to constant weight for CN analysis.
- Instrumentation: Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 Elemental Analyser for carbon and nitrogen content.
- Calibration/quality control: EDTA standards used at start and every ten samples; reported reference values: N 9.59% (±3%), C 41.1% (±1%).
- Analysis timeframe: CN analysis conducted in June 2021.
- Outputs: C content (%) and N content (%) per sample; accompanying metadata describe depth, location, and sampling context.

## Nature of the data and intended use

- Enables exploration of how C and N contents vary with soil type, permafrost state, ALT, ground ice, and site-specific environmental history.
- Supports cross-site comparisons across northern Canada and contributes to carbon/nitrogen budgeting under changing climate and permafrost conditions.
- Useful for researchers seeking correlations between CN content and geomorphic/soil processes (cryoturbation, cryostructure, buried horizons).

## Provisos, limitations, and considerations

- Heterogeneity across profiles: sample counts per profile vary; some sites have complex lenses of organic/mineral material and varying ice content.
- Some ALT measurements come from different methods (probe vs. vertical section), which may affect comparability.
- Ground ice observations are not uniform across all profiles; absence of observed ice does not guarantee absence in unsampled depths.
- The primary, detailed site context is in the accompanying Word document; the CSV provides condensed CN data and essential metadata.

## Provenance and access

- Field collection by Murton, Opel, Kokelj (2019–2020); CN analysis and data processing by Friggens (Exeter) with project support from Zaragoza-Castells.
- Data stored as a CSV with 14 columns; full environmental context and procedural details available in the related Word document.
- Samples were stored frozen during fieldwork and transit; CN results finalized in mid-2021.
