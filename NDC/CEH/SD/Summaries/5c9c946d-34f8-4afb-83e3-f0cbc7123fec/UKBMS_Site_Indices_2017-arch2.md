# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Organization and purpose
  - Funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteers; provides annual data on butterfly population status from site-based monitoring and randomly sampled 1km squares.
  - Monitors since 1976; currently over 2500 active sites each year; dataset supports understanding biodiversity status and policy questions.
- Data collection framework (components)
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide belt, all species recorded weekly from April–September (ideally 26 counts/year); ~2000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on selected species.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): transect methodology in stratified-random 1km squares; two parallel 1km transects, 2–4 visits/year (min 2 in July/August); ~750 squares/year.
- Data nature and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures, not absolute counts) from counts within transects/sites.
  - Collated species indices produced with Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) plus site-weighting by flight period coverage to emphasize observed data; combines all counts across methods to estimate seasonal patterns and fill gaps.
- Quality control
  - Field data collected on standard forms; online entry via UKBMS data site or Transect Walker; automated checks flag anomalies.
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; ongoing checks throughout the season.
  - Further automated/manual validation for out-of-range distributions, unusual flight periods, first-time site records, or extreme/dissimilar counts; corrections applied to the main dataset as needed.
- Details of this data download
  - Contains annual abundance indices for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, 1976–2017; provided as a CSV.
  - Columns include:
    - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
    - COUNTRY: region used for regional collated index
    - SPECIES CODE: unique species code
    - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea v2.2)
    - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (Emmet & Heath)
    - YEAR: year of the collated index
    - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year; -2 indicates insufficient monitoring within the flight period
