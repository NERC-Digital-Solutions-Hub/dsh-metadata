# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers contribute data, and the scheme has tracked butterfly population changes in the UK since 1976, now covering over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status to answer policy questions about biodiversity status and trends.

## Data collection and components

- Sampling framework includes:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts from April to September (ideally 26 counts/year) across nearly 2,000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) to capture focal species with lower effort.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects per square, 2–4 visits/year (primarily farmland).
- Components are analyzed together to produce comprehensive trend data.
- Coverage and scope: the WCBS complements standard transects by sampling common habitats; combined efforts enable broader trend assessment.

## Nature of data and trend analysis

- Data produce abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Site indices reflect a consistent proportion of the population, with detectability affected by species traits.
- Indices across sites and years are combined using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with a weighting adjustment that accounts for the proportion of the species' flight period sampled each year at a site. This approach uses all counts to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, prioritising observed data in the final index.

## Quality control

- Data flow: field collection on standard forms → online entry via the UKBMS data site or Transect Walker → central database.
- Checks occur automatically during entry and through the Transect Walker tool to flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators validate data, with ongoing checks throughout the season.
- Additional automated/manual validation includes cross-referencing distributions (with Butterfly Conservation data) and verifying flight periods, first-time site records, extreme or unusual abundances.
- Corrections and edits are made to the main UKBMS dataset as needed following queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders.

## Details of this data download

- This download provides annual abundance indices for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, covering 1976–2017, in CSV format.
- Column descriptions:
  - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
  - COUNTRY: country contributing data for the regional index
  - SPECIES CODE: unique species identifier
  - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea)
  - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (Emmet & Heath)
  - YEAR: year of the collated index
  - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year; -2 indicates insufficient monitoring for that site-year.

## Licence and attribution
