# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - A collaborative program funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteer data and long-running monitoring to track butterfly population status and inform biodiversity policy.
  - In operation since 1976, with over 2,500 actively recorded sites annually.
  - Data are analyzed across components to produce comprehensive species- and site-level trend insights.

- Data components
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects 2–4 km long;-record all butterflies within a 5 m band; typically 26 counts per year across nearly 2,000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and other methods (egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or limited flight periods.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares; two parallel transects per square; 2–4 visits per year (about 750 squares annually).

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present, varying by species detectability.
  - Collated indices are produced with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), weighted by the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year to emphasize observed data over extrapolated data.

- Quality control
  - Field data collected on standard forms; entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-flight-period records); regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
  - Further automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range distributions, atypical flight periods, first-time site records, and extreme abundances; necessary edits are applied to the main dataset.

- Details of this data download (1976–2017)
  - Provides annual site- and species-specific abundance indices.
  - Data format: CSV file with columns:
    - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
    - COUNTRY: region for calculated local indices
    - SPECIES CODE: unique species identifier
    - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea)
    - COMMON NAME: vernacular name
    - YEAR: year of the collated index
    - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year (−2 indicates insufficient data to calculate an accurate index)
