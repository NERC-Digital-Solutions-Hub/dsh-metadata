# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- Jointly organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Heavily volunteer-driven; acknowledges contributors.
- Provides annual data on butterfly population status from site-based monitoring and random 1km square sampling.
- Since 1976, with data from over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.
- Data underpin understanding of insect population changes and biodiversity policy questions.
- Components are analyzed together to produce overall trend indicators.

## Data collection and components
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km), 5 m wide count band, weekly counts from April to September (aim ~26 counts/year) at ~2,000 sites.
- Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on particular species.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1-km transects, 2–4 visits per year (amidst July/August, with spring visits encouraged); ~750 squares sampled annually.
- Methodology emphasizes consistent recording by habitat/management units and weather suitability for butterfly activity.

## Data processing and trend analysis
- Indices are relative abundances derived from counts across transect sections and sites.
- Site indices feed into species-level collated indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed per site/year.
- Combines data from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS to model seasonal count patterns and extrapolate for gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily.

## Quality control
- Field data collected on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker software before uploading to a central database.
- Built-in automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators validate data; ongoing checks during the season.
- Additional automated/manual validation targets records outside distribution, unusual flight timing, first-time site records, and extreme/mismatched abundances; edits made to the main dataset as needed.

## Details of this data download
- Provides annual abundance indices for each species at each site with sufficient data from 1976–2017.
- Data provided as a CSV file with columns:
  - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
  - COUNTRY: regional source of data for the index
  - SPECIES CODE: unique species identifier
  - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea)
  - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (Emmet & Heath)
  - YEAR: year for which the index is calculated
  - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year (−2 indicates insufficient data to calculate an index)
