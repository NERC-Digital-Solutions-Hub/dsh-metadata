# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope: The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) provides annual data on butterfly population status across the UK, supporting biodiversity policy questions. It is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), with input from volunteers.

- Spatial data framework: Data are collected from site-based monitoring and stratified 1km square surveys, enabling map-based visualization and spatial trend analysis. The framework includes:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes (2–4 km) with weekly counts over the flight season.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1km squares with shorter, fewer visits (2–4 per year).

- Scale and coverage: More than 2,500 actively recorded sites annually; WCBS samples around 750 squares per year; ~2,000 standard transect sites globally across the UK.

- Data product and formats: Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) derived from counts along transects and WCBS, suitable for map-based visualizations and spatial comparisons. Data downloads are provided as CSV files with site- and species-level indices.

- Data use and audience: Indices combine results from all components to produce species-level collated indices, useful for monitoring trends, informing policy, and supporting research.

- Key references and components:
  - Pollard transects: fixed-route counts along habitat divisions; main component of UKBMS.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species or alternative methods during the flight period.
  - WCBS: commonly sampled habitats (e.g., farmland) to improve representation.

- Data structure (for GIS integration):
  - Indices are calculated per species, per site, per year (1976–2017 in the current download).
  - Each row in the download corresponds to a site-species-year combination with a site index value.
  - Data include site code, country, species code/name, year, and the site index. -2 indicates insufficient data for an accurate index at that site/year.

- Data quality and validation:
  - Field recording on standard forms; online entry via UKBMS portal or Transect Walker.
  - Automated checks and regional coordinators review records for plausibility (flight period alignment, distribution range, abnormal counts).
  - Data corrections are made through queries and coordination with recorders/co-ordinators as needed.

- Licensing and attribution:
  - Open Government Licence (OGL) for data use and reuse.
  - Citations and DOIs must be included in publications; attribution should accompany any derived information or imagery: “Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, JNCC.”
