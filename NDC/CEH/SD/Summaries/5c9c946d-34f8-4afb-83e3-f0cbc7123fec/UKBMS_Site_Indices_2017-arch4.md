# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Oversight and funding: Butterfly Conservation, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee; volunteers contribute data.
- Purpose and impact: annual data on butterfly population status to understand changes in biodiversity and answer policy questions; long-running dataset used for trend analysis since 1976 with over 2500 active sites each year.
- Data scope: integrates site-based monitoring with randomly sampled 1km squares; results from different components analyzed together.

## Data collection framework

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects, typically 2-4 km; records all butterflies along a 5m band; weekly from early April to late September; about 26 counts per year across ~2000 sites.
- Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts focusing on specific species or life stages.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1km squares with two parallel transects; 2-4 visits per year (min 2 in July/August); ~750 squares annually; implemented to improve sampling of common habitats like farmland.

## Data processing and trend analysis

- Data products: abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts; site index reflects a portion of the population with detection varying by species.
- Index combination: Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method since 2016, with site-year weights based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed; uses all counts to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, giving more weight to observed data.

## Quality control and governance

- Data entry: field forms, online entry via UKBMS portal or Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
- Validation: automatic checks; regional transect coordinators review records; ongoing season-long checks; additional queries flag records outside known distribution, flight period, or with abnormal values; edits made after coordination.

## Details of this data download

- Content: annual indices of abundance for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, 1976–2017; provided as a CSV.
- Columns: SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX.
- Data notes: if a site was not monitored sufficiently to calculate an accurate site index, SITE INDEX = -2.
