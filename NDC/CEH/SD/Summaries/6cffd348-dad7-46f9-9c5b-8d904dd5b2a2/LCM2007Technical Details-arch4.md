# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides land cover data in multiple formats to suit diverse user needs, with UK coverage.

## Formats and Scales
- Vector data (most detailed): polygons representing land cover with attributes and metadata about derivation; minimum mapable unit 0.5 ha; supply format: ESRI Shapefile; coverage: UK.
- Raster data: five raster products; a 25 x 25 m raster for the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel; four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarising the 25 x 25 m raster; scales: 25 m and 1 km; supply format: GeoTiff; coverage: UK.

## Metadata and Documentation
- Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Documentation includes:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets

## Access and Usage Considerations
- Comprehensive documentation supports understanding of attributes, classes, and raster metadata, aiding discovery and appropriate use.

## Implications for Data Strategy
- Multiple formats and scales enable alignment with user needs and integration into data governance and strategy.
- Emphasizes the importance of metadata quality and clear documentation for discoverability and interoperability.

## Next Steps
- Review the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation for detailed attribute definitions, class mappings, and raster metadata.
- Integrate LCM2007 into data products and governance processes with attention to metadata completeness and user needs.
