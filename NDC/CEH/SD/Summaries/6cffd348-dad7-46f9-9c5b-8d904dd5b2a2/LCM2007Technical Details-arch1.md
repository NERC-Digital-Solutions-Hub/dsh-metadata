# Land Cover Map 2007

- Overview: Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in multiple formats to suit different user needs, with both vector and raster data covering the UK.
- Objective for analysts: provide detailed land cover information at parcel (vector) and grid (raster) scales to support habitat classification, mapping, and related analyses.

## Vector data
- Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land parcel with attributes for land cover and metadata describing derivation (see Dataset Documentation).
- Scale: Minimum Mapable Unit for land cover parcels is 0.5 ha.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Coverage: United Kingdom.

## Raster data
- Five raster products; 25 x 25 m rasters give the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
- Scale: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
- Supply format: GeoTiff.
- Coverage: United Kingdom.
