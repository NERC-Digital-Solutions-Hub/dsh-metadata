# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users

## Vector data (the most detailed product)
- Each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata describing how the information was derived (see Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation).
- Minimum Mapable Unit for land cover parcels: 0.5 hectares.
- Supply format: ESRI® Shapefile.
- Coverage: UK.

## Raster data
- Five raster products exist; a 25 x 25 m raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products summarise the 25 x 25 m raster.
- Detailed metadata for the raster formats available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Scale: 25 m and 1 km pixel size.
- Supply format: GeoTiff.
- Coverage: UK.

## Further information
- The document "Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation" includes:
  - Table 1. Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2. Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes for LCM2007.
