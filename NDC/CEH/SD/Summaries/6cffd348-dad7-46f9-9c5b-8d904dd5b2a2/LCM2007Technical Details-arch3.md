# Land Cover Map 2007

- Purpose and scope
  - Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) provides UK land cover information in multiple formats to suit different user needs, supporting monitoring, scrutiny, and policy decision-making.

- Data formats and scales
  - Vector data (most detailed): parcels as polygons with land cover attributes; metadata on how information was derived; minimum mappable unit of 0.5 ha; format: ESRI Shapefile; coverage: UK.
  - Raster data: five products; a 25 x 25 m raster for the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel; four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarise the 25 m data; format: GeoTIFF; coverage: UK.

- Metadata and documentation
  - Detailed documentation available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation, including:
    - Table 1: attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
    - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes
    - Table 3: metadata information for the raster datasets

- Implications for monitoring and governance
  - Supports monitoring at multiple scales (detailed vector vs. summarized raster) for policy evaluation and trend analysis.
  - Metadata and class definitions enable quality assessment, reproducibility, and transparent data governance.
  - The 0.5 ha minimum mapping unit influences sensitivity to detect land cover change.
  - Data may require transformation to integrate with other datasets, highlighting the need for clear metadata and consistent standards.

- Additional information
  - Refer to the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation for detailed attribute and class descriptions (Tables 1–3).
