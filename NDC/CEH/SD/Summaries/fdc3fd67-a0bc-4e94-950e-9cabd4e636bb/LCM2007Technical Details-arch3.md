# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides UK land cover information in two primary formats (vector and raster) to support diverse monitoring and analysis needs.
- Detailed metadata and attribute information are available in the LCM2007 Dataset Documentation.

## Data formats

### Vector data
- Most detailed product: vector polygons representing land cover parcels, with attributes and metadata describing derivation.
- Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectares.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).

### Raster data
- Five raster products summarise the vector information.
- Most detailed raster: 25 x 25 metre pixels for the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel.
- Additional: four freely available 1 x 1 kilometre rasters that summarize the 25 x 25 metre data.
- Supply format: GeoTIFF.
- Coverage: UK.
- Pixel scales: 25 m and 1 km.

## Metadata and documentation
- Detailed metadata and attribute mappings are provided in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Key referenced tables include:
  - Table 1: Description of attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

## Practical considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Availability of both vector and raster formats supports monitoring at multiple scales and with different analytical approaches.
- Rich metadata and explicit documentation facilitate data provenance, quality assessment, and reproducibility.
- Public data sharing and metadata standards are important considerations for integrating LCM2007 into monitoring outputs.
- Understanding the derivation and classification schemes (via the dataset documentation) is essential for accurate interpretation and comparability.
