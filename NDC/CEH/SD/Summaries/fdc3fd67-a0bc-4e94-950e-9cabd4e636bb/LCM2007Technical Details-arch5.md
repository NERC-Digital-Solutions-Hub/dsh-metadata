# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 is available in different formats to suit diverse user needs.
- Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).

## Vector data
- Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata describing how information was derived.
- Minimum Mapable Unit for land cover parcels: 0.5 hectares.
- Supply Format: ESRI Shapefile.

## Raster data
- Five raster products overall.
- A 25 x 25 metre raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products summarise the 25 x 25 m raster.
- Detailed metadata for the LCM2007 raster formats available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
- Supply Format: GeoTiff.

## Documentation and metadata
- Further information is available in the document Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation, including:
  - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes for LCM2007
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets

## Governance and use considerations for Data Stewards
- Format diversity requires consistent metadata and clear documentation to ensure interoperability and usability.
- Metadata and attribute information are detailed in the provided tables and dataset documentation, aiding discovery and correct interpretation.
- Alignment of vector and raster class schemes (as described in Tables 1 and 2) supports standardized data governance and user needs.
