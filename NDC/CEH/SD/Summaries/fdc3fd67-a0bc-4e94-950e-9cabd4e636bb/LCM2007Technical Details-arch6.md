# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview
- Provides UK land cover information in multiple formats to support diverse user needs.
- Includes both vector (detailed parcels) and raster (pixel-based summaries) representations.

## Data formats and coverage
- Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).
- Vector data:
  - Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectare.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Attributes describe land cover; metadata describe the derivation.
- Raster data:
  - Five raster products (five formats/summaries).
  - 25 x 25 m raster gives the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
  - Supply format: GeoTiff.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.

## Documentation and metadata
- Detailed metadata and class descriptions are in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets.

## Practical considerations for data users
- Choose vector for detailed parcel-level representation; choose raster for broad habitat summaries and easy integration with raster workflows.
- Refer to the Dataset Documentation for exact attribute definitions and class mappings.
- Suitable for analysis and presentation requiring either precise polygon boundaries (vector) or grid-based habitat summaries (rasters).
