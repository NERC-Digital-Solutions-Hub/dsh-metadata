# Concentration Levels of Resistance Genes in Wastewater and Receiving Environment Brief description of the dataset

- Purpose: weekly concentrations of the qnrS resistance gene in wastewater and the receiving environment in South West UK.

- Study area and scope:
  - Five major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) contributing to one river catchment.
  - Catchment area ≈ 2,000 km2; population ~1.5 million ( >75% of catchment population).
  - WWTPs employ conventional secondary treatment (except sequencing batch reactors at some sites using decantation).
  - Includes influent and effluent wastewater, digested sludge at WWTP B and E, and river water upstream and downstream of effluent discharge (Site E river water not collected).

- Sampling period and design:
  - 7 consecutive days, Wednesday to Tuesday, between June and October 2015.
  - Influent samples: volume-proportional 24 h composites with ~15-minute subsamples via ISCO 3700 autosampler.
  - Effluent samples: time-proportional collection due to limited variation over 15-minute intervals.
  - River water samples: 8 L grab samples.
  - Sample collection and handling: all samples kept on ice during transport to the lab.

- Laboratory workflow (DNA extraction and quantification):
  - DNA extraction from 1 mL unfiltered wastewater using a Roche High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit.
  - Extraction quality checked by NanoDrop quantification.
  - DNA stored at -20°C until analysis.

- qnrS quantification by digital PCR (dPCR):
  - Instrument: QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR system with 20X qnrS TaqMan assay.
  - Reaction composition: 7.3 μL Master Mix V2, 0.7 μL qnrS assay, 1.5 μL nuclease-free water, 6.0 μL DNA sample.
  - Chip loading: high-density nanofluidic chips loaded on a QuantStudio 9700 system.
  - Thermal cycling: 95°C initial denaturation; 60°C anneal/extension; 98°C denaturation cycle; 40 cycles; final hold at 60°C.
  - Data processing: AnalysisSuite software used to quantify qnrS copies and perform statistical analysis.

- Format and units of the dataset:
  - Concentrations presented as qnrS gene copies in influent and effluent wastewater.
  - Units: copies per microliter (copies/μL).
