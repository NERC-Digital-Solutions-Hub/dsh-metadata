Concentration Levels of Resistance Genes in Wastewater and Receiving Environment Brief description of the dataset

- What the dataset is: Weekly concentrations of the qnrS resistance gene in wastewater and the receiving river environment in the South West UK.

- Geographic and temporal scope:
  - Study area: Five major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) contributing to one river catchment.
  - Coverage: Approximately 2,000 km2 with a population of about 1.5 million (over 75% of the catchment population).
  - Sampling window: 7 consecutive days (Wednesday to Tuesday) between June and October 2015.

- Sampling design and matrices:
  - Wastewater: Influent and effluent collected daily; digested sludge collected at WWTP B and E over three consecutive days.
  - River water: Collected upstream and downstream of effluent discharge points at varying distances; river sampling not conducted for Site E (estuary discharge).
  - Sampling frequency and volumes:
    - Influent: 24 h volume-proportional composites with ~15-minute sub-samples.
    - Effluent: Time-proportional composites due to limited variation.
    - River water: 8 L grab samples.
  - Treatment technologies at WWTPs: Activated sludge (AS) and trickling filters (TF); conventional sedimentation after secondary treatment (except some SBRs using in-situ decantation).

- Laboratory methods and QA:
  - DNA extraction: Performed on 1 mL of unfiltered wastewater with a telation of lysozyme, proteinase K, and standard binding/washing steps (Roche High Pure kit); eluted DNA stored at -20 °C.
  - DNA quantity check: NanoDrop measurement to verify extraction success.
  - qnrS quantification: Digital PCR (dPCR) using QuantStudio 3D with a 20X qnrS TaqMan assay; reaction mix details provided and chips read with the QuantStudio system.
  - Data processing: Analysis Suite software used to quantify the targeted gene and conduct statistical analysis.
  - Quality controls referenced from related literature (Petrie et al. 2016; Castrignano et al. 2018, 2020).

- Data format and units:
  - Concentrations reported as copies of the qnrS gene in wastewater samples (and in the river) per microliter (copies/µL).

- Key outputs and potential uses:
  - Provides standardized, site-specific concentrations of qnrS across influent, effluent, and river compartments.
  - Enables temporal and spatial comparisons of antimicrobial resistance gene dissemination within a catchment.
  - Can support environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessments related to AMR in water systems.

- Data provenance and references:
  - Core methodology and context described in Castrignano et al. (2018, 2020) and Petrie et al. (2016).
