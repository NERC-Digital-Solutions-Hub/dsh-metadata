# Concentration Levels of Resistance Genes in Wastewater and Receiving Environment Brief description of the dataset

## Overview
- Weekly concentrations of the qnrS resistance gene in wastewater and the receiving environment in South West UK.

## Study area and sampling points
- Five major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) contributing to one river catchment.
- Area: approximately 2,000 km2; population ~1.5 million (more than 75% of catchment population).
- Wastewater treatment: conventional sedimentation after secondary treatment (except for some sequencing batch reactors with decantation in-situ); treatment technologies include activated sludge (AS) and trickling filters (TF).
- Sampling locations: influent and effluent wastewater collected; river water sampled upstream and downstream of effluent discharge points at various distances; river water not collected at Site E (WWTP discharges directly to the estuary).
- Sludge samples: digested sludge collected at WWTP B and E over three consecutive days.

## Monitoring design and sample collection
- Timeframe: 7 consecutive days, Wednesday to Tuesday, between June and October 2015.
- Influent wastewater: 24 h composite samples with ~15-minute subsamples using an ISCO 3700 autosampler.
- Effluent wastewater: time-proportional samples due to limited variation over 15-minute intervals.
- River water: 8 L grab samples.
- Sample handling: all samples transported on ice to the laboratory for processing.

## DNA extraction and quantification
- DNA extraction: 1 mL unfiltered wastewater, centrifugation, resuspension in PBS, lysozyme treatment, followed by binding, washing, and elution using a High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit.
- DNA quality check: quantified with NanoDrop to verify successful extraction.
- Storage: DNA samples stored at -20 °C.

## qnrS gene quantification using digital PCR (dPCR)
- Instrument: QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR system with a 20X qnrS TaqMan assay.
- Reaction mix per sample: 7.3 μL Master Mix V2, 0.7 μL qnrS assay, 1.5 μL nuclease-free water, 6.0 μL DNA sample.
- Loading: 14.5 μL of the mixture onto digital PCR load blades and distributed on high-density nanofluidic chips.
- Thermal cycling: 95 °C hold 10 min; 60 °C for 2 min; 98 °C for 30 s; repeat 40 cycles; final 60 °C hold 2 min; cool to room temperature.
- Analysis: QuantStudio 3D software for quantification.

## Format of the dataset
- Reported concentrations are in copies per microliter (copies/μL) for influent, effluent, and, where applicable, river water samples.
