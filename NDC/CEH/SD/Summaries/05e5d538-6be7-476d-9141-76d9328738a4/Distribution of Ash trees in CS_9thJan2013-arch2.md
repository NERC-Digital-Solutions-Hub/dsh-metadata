# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- Purpose and context
  - Countryside Survey (CS) is a long-running, rigorous audit of the UK countryside, enabling comparisons across surveys since 1978.
  - This report assesses the extent and distribution of ash trees to understand potential impacts of ash dieback, focusing on ash in woodlands <0.5 ha, ash in non-woodland settings, and ash within linear features (hedgerows and lines of trees).
  - Uses CS sampling in 1 km squares, with data harmonised against National Forestry Inventory (NFI) data to avoid duplication; CS emphasizes current land cover rather than stocking status.

- Methodology (key data products)
  - Areas:  ash area in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha per 1 km square, then national total by landclass; uses mid-points of percent-cover categories to estimate ash presence.
  - Individual trees: counts of ash outside woodland within each 1 km square, including small clumps; up to 10 veteran ash trees per square recorded with extra details.
  - Woody Linear Features (WLF): estimation of ash length within hedgerows, lines of trees, and belts; use proportion bands from woody features and hedgerow plots (D plots) to derive national ash length within lin ear features.
  - Vegetation plots: restricted random plots (linear and areal plots) within each square to assess ash occupancy and mean cover across landscape components (hedgerows, boundaries, streams, roadsides, arable margins, etc.).

- Key findings
  - Areal extent in small woodland patches: ash in <0.5 ha woodlands totals ~38.5 thousand ha in Great Britain; England dominates with ~32.1 thousand ha; Scotland ~4.4 thousand ha; Wales ~2 thousand ha.
  - Landscape distribution: ash occurs across fields, field boundaries, along rivers, and is particularly common in hedgerows.
  - Ranks among species: ash is the second most abundant tree species in small woodland patches after oak; in England still second to oak; Scotland and Wales show different rankings among broadleaved species.
  - Non-woodland trees: ~2.2 million individual ash trees outside woodlands in GB; England accounts for the majority (~1.83 million); Scotland ~147k; Wales ~240k.
  - Hedgerows: ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species (as a standard in hedgerows), with oak a distant second.
  - Linear features: ash present in ~98,900 km of woody linear features across GB, predominantly in England (about 86,100 km), with hedgerows forming the majority (roughly 66,300 km of hedgerows with ash; 19,700 km lines of trees).
  - Vegetation plots: ash found in about 30% of hedgerow plots; variable mean ash cover across plot types (e.g., hedges around 20% mean cover, road verges around 20%; streamside plots higher around 25% mean cover).
  - Temporal change: ash occupancy has increased on linear features from 1978 to 2007 (significant in linear plots); ash area plots also increased from 1990 to 2007, indicating a recent expansion across landscapes.

- Areas and distributions by region (highlights)
  - GB areal ash in woodland patches <0.5 ha: 38.5 thousand ha (England ~32.1; Scotland ~4.4; Wales ~2.0).
  - Individual ash trees outside woodlands (GB): ~2.208 million total (England ~1.821 million; Scotland ~147k; Wales ~240k).
  - WLF containing ash (GB): total ~98.9 thousand km (England ~86.1k; Scotland ~3.7k; Wales ~9.1k).
  - Hedgerow ash prevalence: ash is the top hedgerow tree species; hedgerow ash contributes notably to the hedgerow landscape.

- Discussion and implications for monitoring
  - Ash is a significant and growing component of the British countryside, particularly as a hedgerow and linear-feature element; its loss could create substantial gaps in hedgerow structure and associated habitat.
  - The CS data provide both area-based and linear-based representations of ash distribution, enabling spatially explicit outputs and national scaling.
  - The report emphasizes the potential for future linkage with disease monitoring (e.g., ash dieback) and further analyses to relate ash distribution to drivers like climate, soil, and land use.

- Future work and recommendations
  - Develop protocols to monitor disease impact and mortality on ash within CS.
  - Create enhanced linear products to scale from 1 km squares to GB-wide coverage, possibly integrating LIDAR and other spatial datasets.
  - Combine CS data with additional woodland surveys to assess ash associations with other plant species and broader ecological impacts.
  - Investigate drivers of ash distribution and change (e.g., climate, substrate, competition with other species) to support predictive modelling of ash dieback and future distribution.
  - Use CS as a complementary dataset to forest inventories, enabling cross-validation and richer analyses of ash in different spatial contexts.

- Additional notes
  - The report includes Appendix maps for other broadleaved species and references to related methodological sources (e.g., land classification frameworks and CS2007 methodology).

- Implications for data management and policy
  - CS data demonstrate how standardized, repeatable monitoring can reveal long-term trends in species distribution and landscape structure.
  - The approach supports transparency, reproducibility, and the potential for data sharing, with future opportunities to integrate datasets for broader environmental health monitoring.
