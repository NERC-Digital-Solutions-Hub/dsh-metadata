# Countryside Survey 2007

- Aim and purpose
  - Provide hard scientific evidence of the countryside’s health in a consistent format to enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Two main components: Field Survey (habitats, vegetation, soils, freshwater) and Land Cover Map (satellite-based digital map published in 2009).
  - Support policy and strategic programmes (e.g., UK Biodiversity Action Plan, Living With Environmental Change) by delivering national and regional habitat extent, condition, and change data.

- Scope of the survey
  - Field Survey: 591 (1 km x 1 km) sample squares across England, Scotland, Wales; plus Northern Ireland data from a separate 0.5 km grid (NICS).
  - Data produced include habitat extent and changes, vegetation condition, soil properties (0–15 cm), and freshwater/pond condition.
  - Land Cover Map: Digital map using satellite data to be published in 2009.

- Habitat classification framework
  - Broad Habitats: 27 Broad Habitat types (e.g., Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodlands; Coniferous Woodlands; Arable/Horticultural Land; Improved/Neutral/Calcareous/Acid Grasslands; Bracken; Dwarf Shrub Heath; Fen/Marsh/Swamp; Bog; Inland Waters; Montane; various aquatic and landscape features; Built-up/Gardens).
  - Priority Habitats: 65 identified in UK Biodiversity Action Plan; CS provides national estimates for some Priority Habitats and identifies how they relate to Broad Habitats.
  - Coding and reporting are designed to be backward compatible with earlier CS years (1984, 1990, 1998) through an integrated Broad Habitat system and a hierarchical vegetation classification.

- Vegetation sampling and plots
  - Up to about 67 vegetation plots per 1 km square; multiple plot types (Main Plots and targeted semi-natural plots) to capture habitat and feature variation.
  - Digital field data capture using GIS-enabled laptops; plots relocated in successive surveys using GPS and photographic records.
  - Vegetation data linked to Broad Habitats via map polygons to assess vegetation condition within each habitat type.

- Soil sampling and analysis
  - Five soil cores (0–15 cm) per square (exact locations vary by year); analyses include pH, carbon concentration, bulk density, and additional soil properties.
  - Soil core locations adjusted across surveys to minimize disturbance.

- Freshwater sampling
  - Headwater streams: biological (macroinvertebrates) and plant community surveys; hydromorphology via River Habitat Survey (RHS) in a 500 m channel length; 350 squares with macroinvertebrate sampling; 361 squares with aquatic plant surveys.
  - Ponds: plant-based condition assessments using PSYM framework (Predictive System for Multimetrics); 77 ponds previously surveyed in 1996 lowland pond survey included for trend analysis; 260 squares contained ponds with one pond surveyed per square in 2007.
  - PSYM scoring translates plant metrics into an ecological condition grade (Very Poor to Good).

- Data collection, quality control, and management
  - Extensive four-week training for survey teams; standardized field protocols.
  - Transition to electronic data capture in 2007 with GIS-based field mapping and a central, geographically linked database.
  - Data integrity checks, mandatory fields, and in-field validation to minimize mapping errors; standardized codes and back-translation to Broad Habitats for time-series consistency.

- Measures of vegetation condition (Box 1.3)
  - Key metrics include: Species Richness; Number of Butterfly and Farmland Bird Food Plants; Grass:Forb Ratio; Competitor, Stress-tolerator, and Ruderal Scores; Light, Fertility, Ellenberg pH, and Moisture Scores.
  - These metrics collectively describe the structure, diversity, and ecological status of vegetation within Broad Habitats.

- Quantifying changes and reporting
  - Area and change in Broad Habitats calculated for Great Britain, England, Scotland, and Wales; UK totals include Northern Ireland via the NI Countryside Survey (NICS).
  - Long-term vegetation change (1978–2007) tracked using Aggregate Classes (ACs) to maintain comparability over time despite habitat classification changes.
  - Conversion between Broad Habitats (net flows from 1998 to 2007) reported to indicate directional habitat changes, recognizing potential mapping and data-processing noise.
  - Significance testing: changes reported at 0.05 level (with 0.01 or 0.001 where applicable); arrows and brackets indicate direction and significance of change.

- Priority Habitat estimation and masking approaches
  - Priority Habitats identified in the field and back-allocated to earlier years (1998) where feasible; spatial masking used to delineate upland/lowland and woodland types (e.g., SNH masks, JNCC masks, Natural Areas masks, Welsh upland mask).

- Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS)
  - Independent NI programme integrated into the UK framework; sampling intensity and methods adapted for NI (0.5% grid; 288 squares in 2007).
  - Data linked to UK Broad Habitats through updated correspondence and masking approaches; field protocols updated for richer species composition data and refined hedgerow definitions.

- Reporting framework and outputs
  - Results presented as Area ('000s hectares), Change ('000s ha), and condition measures for Broad and Priority Habitats.
  - Outputs are provided at UK, GB, and country levels; Ireland data integrated for UK totals where applicable; detailed country reports published separately.
  - Annexes and boxes provide methodological detail (e.g., PSYM, ACs, Habitat coding) and data sources.

- Data accessibility, usage, and cautions
  - Data and methodology are designed for wide policy and research use; data are stored in a central GIS-enabled database and are available for further analysis.
  - Cautions: results are estimates from a sample; extrapolation beyond intended use requires reference to original data and methods; urban and intertidal coverage is limited; changes reflect both real ecological change and potential mapping/processing noise.

- Practical implications for policy and monitoring
  - The survey provides a 30-year record of environmental change, enabling policy evaluation and trend analysis across broad habitat types.
  - Supports monitoring against UK Biodiversity Action Plan targets and informs related strategic programmes.
  - Establishes a framework for long-term environmental assessment with standardized data collection, classification, and reporting.
