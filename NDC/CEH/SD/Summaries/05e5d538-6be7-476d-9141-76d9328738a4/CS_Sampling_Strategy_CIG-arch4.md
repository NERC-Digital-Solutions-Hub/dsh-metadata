# THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

- Overview
  - The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) describes the field survey sampling framework used up to 2007, building on 30 years of methodological development.
  - It links current practice to its predecessors, highlighting why the methodology is inherently tied to historical approaches and time-series value.
  - The strategy centers on using a standardized land classification to stratify the landscape and guide representative sampling.

- Core concepts for data strategy
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage and minimize bias across diverse ecological and land-use contexts.
  - The ITE Land Classification (initially 32 classes; later expanded) serves as the backbone for stratification and for estimating national-scale habitat areas.
  - Use of environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to define and refine land classes; employment of multivariate clustering and, originally, Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) for classification.
  - Time-series consistency: sampling frames and classifications evolved to maintain comparability across surveys, with explicit attention to national (GB) and country-specific reporting.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework
  - 1978 – The Beginning
    - ISA-based classification of 1 km squares into 32 land classes using center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid (1228 classified squares; plus four surrounding squares per center).
    - Sampling: eight 1 km squares per land class (total 256) for national habitat estimates.
  - 1984 – Second land-use survey
    - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384); continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990)
    - Extended classification to every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; all features recorded from CS1990 plus repeat vegetation quadrats.
    - National estimates based on the 1990 Land Classification, with broader data integration.
  - 1998–2000 – Developments leading to a revised Land Classification
    - Recognition that a GB-wide, detailed 1 km square classification was needed for regional/local estimates; new surrogates and multiple classification tests were used.
    - A new classification was accepted even though some squares shifted classes; overall class characteristics remained stable.
    - For policy needs, distinct country-level reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and later upland habitat estimates were identified as important.
    - Changes in framework affected how national estimates were derived and how land classes were represented across countries.
  - 2007 – Developments for Wales-only reporting and broader country reflection
    - Wales-specific reporting requirements led to sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions (creating 5 new Welsh-specific classes, e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45; Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure representation of new Welsh classes (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class).
    - England retained most classes but some English classes (5e, 15e) were reduced to 4 squares per class due to balance with Welsh sampling; overall precision deemed acceptable.
    - A Wales-focused framework and Wales-only estimates were implemented, with England-Scotland reporting maintained under revised classifications.
  - 2007 – Upland module
    - An additional module funded to survey uplands in England and Wales to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates within country-based reporting.

- Data handling, sampling layout, and national estimates
  - Sampling frames are defined by land-class maps, with squares distributed to reflect the extent of each class across GB.
  - National estimates are calculated using: mean habitat area per square for each class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - Documentation emphasizes the need to maintain consistency across time while updating classifications for country-specific reporting.
  - Acknowledges the complexity of changing classifications and their impact on cross-survey comparability; advises using the latest classification for internal consistency within a survey while noting cross-survey comparability considerations.

- Challenges and considerations for data leaders
  - Maintaining comparability in a changing land-class framework across decades and across countries (England, Wales, Scotland).
  - Balancing representative sampling with country-specific reporting needs, especially post-devolution.
  - Ensuring adequate sample sizes per Welsh/English class to support robust Wales-only and England-only estimates.
  - Managing metadata, maps, and documentation to track reclassifications, class subdivisions, and changes in sampling intensity over time.
  - Integrating upland modules to improve precision for habitat estimates in higher-altitude areas.
