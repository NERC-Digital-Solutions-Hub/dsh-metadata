# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- Overview and purpose
  - Countryside Survey (CS) is a long-running, national audit of the UK countryside conducted since 1978 to enable comparisons over time.
  - This report focuses on the extent and distribution of Fraxinus excelsior (ash) to understand potential impacts of ash dieback and how ash occupies the landscape (woodlands, hedgerows, linear features, and as individual trees).
  - Data are used to inform understanding of current ash distribution and to explore changes over time, with a view to monitoring and modeling future scenarios.

- Data and sources
  - Primary data come from CS 2007 at 1 km2 resolution, using a stratified random sampling design across GB.
  - CS data are overlaid with National Forestry Inventory (NFI) and FC woodland data to avoid duplication and to distinguish current land cover from stocked woodland areas.
  - Methods generate national estimates from square-level observations, with landclass-based weighting to scale results to GB.

- Key data products and metrics
  - Areal extent in woodlands <0.5 ha
    - Ash: 38.51 thousand hectares (GB); England ~32.07k ha; Scotland ~4.44k ha; Wales ~1.99k ha.
    - Ash is the second-most abundant tree in these smallwoodland patches after Oak; distribution varies by country.
  - Individual ash trees outside woodland
    - Estimated total: ~2.208 million trees in GB; England ~1.821 million; Scotland ~0.147 million; Wales ~0.240 million.
    - Most outside woodlands are small-to-medium in size; veteran trees are relatively uncommon.
  - Hedgerow and woody linear features
    - Total ash-containing woody linear features: ~98.9 thousand km across GB.
    - Breakdown: hedgerows ~75.1k km; lines of trees ~23.6k km; belts minimal.
    - England contains the bulk of ash in linear features (≈86.1k km total; hedgerows ≈66.3k km).
  - Vegetation plots and occupancy
    - Ash present in about 30% of hedgerow vegetation plots.
    - Ash occurs across diverse linear and areal plot types, with notable presence along streamsides, hedgerows, and field boundaries.
  - Spatial patterns and visualization
    - Areal maps show ash concentration hotspots in southeast England; spatial patterns are indicative rather than exact high-resolution maps.
    - Figures illustrate distribution of individual trees, hedgerow trees, and ash density in linear features.

- Methodology: how estimates are derived
  - Areas (woodland patches)
    - Use 1 km2 squares with habitat mapping and dominant species per cover class; ash area per square derived from mid-point of cover classes and landclass weighting; exclusion of NFI-reported woodlands to avoid duplication.
  - Individual trees
    - Record all ash outside woodland within each 1 km square; include small clumps (below mapping unit); up to 10 veteran trees per square with additional traits recorded (epiphytes, dead wood, hollow trunk).
  - Woody linear features
    - Distinguish lines of trees, hedgerows (natural shape) and belts (unnatural shape); ash proportion estimated by species-specific cover bands or plot-level measures (D plots near hedges); scale to national totals by landclass area.
  - Vegetation plots
    - Nested sampling: 1 x 10 m linear plots along features; 2 x 2 m plots for unenclosed land; multi-scale plots to assess occupancy and changes over time.
  - Change detection
    - Occupancy changes over time (1978–2007 on linear features; 1990–2007 on area plots) analyzed using a change index, with significance testing for observed trends.

- Key findings and interpretation for data stewardship
  - Ash is a major component of the British countryside, especially in hedgerows and small woodland patches; its loss would create substantial gaps in hedgerow structure.
  - Distribution shows higher ash presence in England, with regional variation (England > Scotland/Wales in many metrics for ash in patches and linear features).
  - Individual ash trees outside woodland are predominantly small-to-medium in size; veteran trees are relatively rare but present.
  - Ash is the most common hedgerow tree species and a major contributor to hedgerow length in ash-containing linear features.
  - Temporal increases observed:
    - Ash occupancy increased on linear features from 1978 to 2007 (statistically significant for linear plots).
    - Ash occupancy in area plots increased from 1990 to 2007.
  - Data enable exploration of ash distribution relative to multiple environmental drivers, though this report does not attribute causes; future work could integrate soil, climate, and other drivers.

- Data quality, limitations, and governance considerations
  - Not a fully spatially explicit map; results are estimations based on 1 km2 squares and landclass weighting, suitable for national-scale insights but not precise site-level mapping.
  - Differences in definitions between CS and NFI (e.g., what counts as woodland) can affect comparability; CS uses current land cover, not stocked woodland in some cases.
  - Veteran tree identification can be subject to surveyor interpretation;尤其 for very old trees in challenging environments.
  - The report focuses on ash distribution and does not attempt to explain drivers; it emphasizes potential for linking with additional data (soil, climate, deposition) and for modeling future ash dieback impacts.

- Future work and data stewardship implications
  - Develop monitoring protocols for ash diseases and mortality; extend CS methods to capture disease impact and tree health.
  - Create a linear-product that integrates CS field data with LIDAR, OS mapping, and Land Cover Map to improve spatial scaling and accuracy for linear features.
  - Explore complementary analyses with other woodland datasets (e.g., GB woodland survey) to study interactions (e.g., impacts of elm loss on ash distribution) and species associations.
  - Expand analyses to identify plant species associated with ash presence and to support ecological impact assessments.
  - Enhance data sharing and metadata for reuse by users, including detailed methodological documentation and potential integration points with climate, deposition, and soil datasets for future modeling.
