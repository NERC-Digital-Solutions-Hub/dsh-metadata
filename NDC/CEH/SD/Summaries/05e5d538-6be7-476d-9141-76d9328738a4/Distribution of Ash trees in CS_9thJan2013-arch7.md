# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

## Aim and scope
- UK Countryside Survey provides repeated, rigorous measures of countryside resources to compare changes over time.
- This report estimates the extent and distribution of ash trees in Great Britain, focusing on:
  - Areal extent in Broadleaved woodlands smaller than 0.5 ha
  - Number of individual ash trees outside woodland
  - Ash distribution in woody linear features (hedgerows and lines of trees)
  - Trends in ash occupancy in fixed vegetation plots
  - Areal extents of other common broadleaf species for context

## Key findings
- Ash in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha: ≈38,500 ha (GB).
- Ash appears across landscape components (fields, field boundaries, along rivers/streams, hedgerows).
- Ash is the second most abundant tree species in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha) in GB after Oak; England is most ash-rich among the home nations (England ≈32,100 ha; Scotland ≈4,400 ha; Wales ≈1,990 ha).
- Outside woodlands, an estimated ≈2.2 million ash trees; ash is the second most common species by number of individual trees.
- Most ash trees have small-to-mid range diameter at breast height (DbH), predominantly 21–50 cm; veteran trees are rare.
- Ash is the most common hedgerow tree species (as hedgerow standards); Oak is second.
- Ash contributes ≈98,900 km of woody linear features across GB (≈86,100 km in England; hedgerows are the major component, with lines of trees also contributing).
- Ash occupancy has increased on linear features (1978–2007) and on area plots (1990–2007), indicating a countryside-wide rise in ash presence.

## Methods (overview)
- Data are drawn from the Countryside Survey (CS), which samples 1 km square units across GB using stratified random sampling aligned to ecological landclasses.
- Areas (areal estimates): CS square habitat data are overlaid with NFI/Forestry Commission data to avoid duplication and to estimate ash presence by landclass; percentages are used to estimate average ash area per 1 km square, then scaled nationally.
- Individual trees: record every ash outside woodland with a modal DbH; include small clumps (below mmu of 20 m × 20 m); veteran trees recorded (up to 10 per 1 km square).
- Hedgerow and woody linear features: two types (lines of trees and hedgerows; belts of trees considered where appropriate); ash proportion estimated within these features using plot data adjacent to hedges (D plots) and midpoints of proportion bands; national totals derived by stratum (land class) means multiplied by feature extent.
- Vegetation plots: nested plot design within each 1 km square; both linear and areal features sampled; changes in ash occupancy assessed with a change index that accounts for the nested design.
- Analyses incorporate CS maps, Land Cover Map data, and, where relevant, supplementary datasets (e.g., NFI/FC data).

## Results

### Areas
- National estimates show ash as the second most abundant broadleaved species in woodlands <0.5 ha.
- England hosts the largest ash area in small patches, followed by Scotland and Wales.
- Distribution maps indicate ash concentration is higher in south-east England and lower in north-west Scotland.

### Individual trees
- Estimated 2.2 million ash trees outside woodlands in GB; England accounts for the majority (≈1.83 million), with Scotland ≈147,000 and Wales ≈240,000.
- Ash is the second most common species among individual trees across GB.
- Hedgerow trees: ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species, ahead of oak and others.
- Age/size distribution shows most individuals are in the mid-range DbH categories; veteran trees are relatively rare.

### Hedgerows and woody linear features
- Total ash-containing woody linear features: ≈98,900 km (Lines of Trees ≈23.6k km; Hedgerows ≈75.1k km; Belts ≈0.1k km).
- England contains the vast majority of ash in hedgerows and lines of trees (≈86.1k km total; hedgerows ≈66.3k km; lines of trees ≈19.7k km).
- Scotland and Wales have substantially fewer ash-containing linear features.

### Vegetation plots
- Ash present in about 30% of hedgerow-related plots (out of various hedge plot types).
- Table-driven data show mean ash cover varies by plot type (boundary, hedge, hedge diversity plots, roadside, streamside, arable margins, field plots, small habitat patches).
- Across the landscape, ash occupancy on linear features increased from 1978 to 2007; occupancy on area/vegetation plots also rose from 1990 to 2007.

## Discussion
- The CS dataset provides novel, data-driven products showing ash distribution and its role in the landscape, including maps derived from landclass means and, where possible, direct mapping using the Land Cover Map 2007.
- Ash is a significant component of the British countryside: dominant in hedgerows and common along linear features, with substantial presence in small woodland patches and as individual trees.
- The study notes potential drivers of distribution (e.g., elm decline) but does not attribute changes to specific causal factors; it emphasizes the potential value for more complex modelling incorporating soils, climate, land use, and disease dynamics (e.g., ash dieback).
- Future work includes developing linear products scalable to GB, integrating additional data sources (e.g., LIDAR, OS maps), and linking ash distribution with broader ecological drivers and disease monitoring.

## Future work and potential data products
- Develop monitoring protocols for ash diseases and mortality.
- Create a linear feature product that scales from 1 km CS squares to all of GB, integrating CS field data with high-resolution base maps (LIDAR, OS) and Land Cover Map data.
- Extend vegetation plot analyses to explore associations between ash and other species, and use CS alongside woodland surveys to test drivers and potential ecological impacts of ash distribution changes.
- Explore complementarities between CS data and other national woodland inventories to better understand ash dynamics in relation to elm decline and other landscape changes.
