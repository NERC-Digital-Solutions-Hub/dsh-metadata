Countryside Survey 2007

Overview
- Purpose: Provide robust data on the extent, condition, and change of Broad and Priority Habitats across Great Britain to inform policy, biodiversity monitoring, and countryside management.
- Structure: Two main components
  - Field Survey (habitats, vegetation, soils 0-15 cm, freshwater)
  - Land Cover Map (satellite-based digital map to be published in 2009)
- Time series: Part of a 30-year sequence (1978–2007) enabling long-term change analysis; UK-wide integration with Northern Ireland (NICS).

Data collection and sampling design
- Sampling framework
  - 591 sample squares (1 km x 1 km) across GB: England 289, Wales 107, Scotland 195; plus NI 288 squares (0.5 km x 0.5 km) via NICS
  - Stratified by Land Classes to capture environmental gradients; repeated sampling across surveys to track change
  - Data from all years modelled to maximise use of available data; allows GB and country-level reporting
- Habitat mapping and classification
  - Broad Habitats: 27 categories; Priority Habitats: 65 categories
  - Mapping relies on a standardized key and polygon-based habitat parcels within each square
  - Land Classes (45) used to estimate habitat areas and changes; includes conversion flows between Broad Habitats
- Vegetation plots and sampling
  - Up to ~67 plots per square; Main Plots plus targeted plots to capture habitat diversity
  - Plots relocated across surveys using GPS, maps, and photos to enable change detection
  - Aggregate Classes (ACs) used to summarize vegetation condition across years
- Soils sampling
  - 0–15 cm soil samples collected from five Main Plots per square (varied by year)
  - Analyses include pH, carbon concentration, bulk density, and related soil properties; detailed methods in Annex 4
- Freshwater sampling
  - Headwater streams: surveyed in 373 of 591 squares; baseline macroinvertebrates and stream plants (where present)
  - Stream habitat diversity (RHS) and Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) for 500 m of each stream
  - Ponds: one pond per surveyed square (where present) with plant-based condition assessment; PSYM used to rate pond quality (Good to Very Poor)
  - Data enable assessment of changes in stream and pond communities and nutrient enrichment since earlier surveys

Data management, quality, and systems
- Data capture and workflow
  - First large-scale use of electronic data capture in CS (2007)
  - GIS-based mapping with CEH/ESRI software on rugged laptops; integrated database linking maps, vegetation plots, soils, and freshwater data
  - Regular data download/upload via web-based data management system to ensure currency and accessibility
- Data quality and analysis
  - Standardised field training (four weeks) to ensure consistency
  - Mandatory data fields, completeness checks, and in-field validation of changes to mapped data
  - Statistical analysis via bootstrapping to accommodate complex sampling and provide robust significance testing
  - Significance typically tested at 0.05; results labelled with arrows and asterisks to indicate direction and strength of changes
- Reporting framework and outputs
  - Results presented by UK, GB, and country levels; country-level reports planned for Spring 2009
  - Measures of vegetation condition (Box 1.3) and habitat condition across years (1990, 1998, 2007)
  - Tables cover area changes, habitat conversions, landscape features, soils, and freshwater metrics

Priority Habitats, masks, and integration with other data
- Priority Habitats estimation
  - Field surveyors assign Priority Habitat codes based on habitat and species data; cross-referenced to 1998 definitions where possible
  - Post-survey analysis uses spatial masks to delineate upland/lowland and woodland types (e.g., SNH, JNCC, Natural England masks, Welsh upland mask)
  - National estimates derived by applying masks to GB data and then integrating with NI data for UK totals
- Vegetation condition and long-term change
  - Long-term vegetation change tracked using AC-based cohorts defined in 1978; allows consistent comparison through 1990, 1998, and 2007
  - Conversion between Broad Habitats summarized to show net flows between habitat types (not purely statistical estimates but indicative of management and ecological trends)

Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS) integration
- NI baseline and expansion
  - 1986–1991 baseline, with phased refinements; 628 squares in 1998; 0.5% sampling in 2007 (288 squares)
  - Regional masks and NI land classifications used to derive NI Broad Habitats; results combined with GB to form UK totals
- Data capture in NI
  - Electronic protocols, GPS, and GIS-based field mapping; correspondence between NI Primary Habitats and UK Broad Habitats refined over time

Key measures and interpretation guidance
- Vegetation condition measures (Box 1.3)
  - Species richness, farmland/butterfly food plants, Grass:Forb ratio
  - Competitor, Stress-tolerator, and Ruderal scores (plant strategy framework)
  - Light, Fertility, Ellenberg pH, and Moisture scores for indirect site condition indicators
- Presentation of results
  - Emphasis on stock and change at GB/UK level; country-specific analyses to follow
  - Changes marked with arrows and significance levels; means and 95% confidence limits shown in graphs

How this is relevant to Data Stewards
- Governance and standards
  - Clear, standardized habitat classifications (Broad and Priority) with backward compatibility across survey years
  - Defined sampling strata, plot types, and survey protocols to ensure consistency and traceability
- Data quality and provenance
  - Rigorous training, electronic capture, in-field validation, and GPS-enabled relocation of plots
  - Integrated GIS/database architecture linking habitat maps, vegetation plots, soils, and freshwater data
- metadata and discoverability
  - Detailed methodological annexes (e.g., soils manual, Annex 3 methods) enabling reproducibility and external validation
  - Publication of data products with UK/GB/country breakdowns and documented uncertainty
- Data sharing and reuse
  - Structured data flows (field data → GIS polygons → aggregated habitat metrics) suitable for cataloguing and discovery
  - Clear licensing and rights notes; contact points for access (Countryside Survey office)
- Challenges and considerations
  - Incomplete alignment of some Priority Habitats due to representation in CS samples
  - Data gaps due to dry streams/ponds in some squares; approach to imputation and modelling to maximize usable data across years
  - Interoperability across systems and years requires careful mapping of old codes to Broad/Priority Habitat frameworks
