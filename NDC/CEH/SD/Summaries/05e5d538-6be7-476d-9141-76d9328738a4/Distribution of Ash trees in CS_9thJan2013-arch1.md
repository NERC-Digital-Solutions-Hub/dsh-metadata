# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- The Countryside Survey (CS) provides a long-term, rigorously surveyed dataset to quantify ash distribution in the UK countryside, enabling comparison with past surveys and informing potential disease impacts (e.g., ash dieback).

## Overview of what was analyzed
- Estimation of the areal extent of ash in Broadleaved woodlands smaller than 0.5 ha.
- Counting ash trees outside woodland (including small clumps) and estimation of veteran trees.
- Distribution and extent of ash in woody linear features (hedgerows, lines of trees, belts).
- Ash presence in vegetation plots across different landscape components (hedgerows, field margins, roadside verges, streamsides, etc.).
- Temporal changes in ash occupancy from multiple CS survey rounds (1978–2007).

## Key findings

- Ash in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha: about 38.5 thousand hectares (GB).
  - England: ~32.1 thousand ha; Scotland: ~4.4 thousand ha; Wales: ~2.0 thousand ha.
- Ash outside woodland (individual trees and small clumps): about 2.2 million trees (GB); England ~1.82 million; Scotland ~147k; Wales ~240k.
- Ash is the second most abundant tree species in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha) after Oak.
- Hedgerows: ash is the most common hedgerow tree species; ash-containing woody linear features total ~98.9 thousand km across GB (England dominates with ~86.1 thousand km; hedgerows alone ~66.3 thousand km).
- Ash is present across multiple landscape components, notably in hedgerows and along streamsides and field boundaries.
- Ash distribution within hedgerows: significant presence in hedgerow plots (about 30% of hedgerows plots contain ash).
- In vegetation plots, ash features prominently in several plot types (e.g., hedgerows, boundary plots, roadside, streamside, field plots), indicating widespread occurrence.
- Temporal change: ash occupancy increased on linear features from 1978 to 2007; ash occupancy also increased in area plots from 1990 to 2007, indicating a broader spread over time.

## Methodology (how the numbers were derived)

- Sampling design: 1 km square stratified random sampling across GB, aligned with national ecological gradients; scaling up to national estimates using landclass connections.
- Areas (woodlands <0.5 ha): ash area estimated per 1 km square from percent cover data within CS plots; overlain with, and reconciled against, Forestry Commission National Forestry Inventory (NFI) data to avoid duplication; absolute national estimates produced by weighting per landclass.
- Individual trees outside woodland: counted within each 1 km square; included small clumps (mmu up to 20 m × 20 m); veteran trees recorded with additional data where present.
- Hedgerows and lines of trees: ash proportion assessed in woody linear features, using different data collection methods for natural vs. unnatural shaped features; estimated ash length in lines of trees, hedgerows, and belts by applying mean ash proportion in each category to the measured length of features per 1 km square and then aggregating by landclass and country.
- Vegetation plots: sampled linear and areal features within each square; calculated ash occupancy using plot-level presence and mean cover, then scaled up to national totals by landclass area.
- Temporal analyses: changes in ash occupancy assessed via change indices in vegetation plots and linear plots over time, with significance testing (p-values reported where relevant).

## Areas and distribution highlights

- Ash is the second most abundant tree species in GB woodlands <0.5 ha, with the highest absolute area in England.
- Distribution maps are approximate (not a spatially explicit map) but indicate higher ash density in southeast England and lower densities in northwest Scotland.
- Ash presence is strongest in hedgerows and along streamsides, highlighting its role in landscape connectivity and habitat structure.

## Woody linear features and hedgerows

- Total ash-containing woody linear features: ~98,900 km across GB.
  - England accounts for the majority of this, with ~86,100 km total; hedgerows contribute the largest share (approx. 66,300 km).
  - Scotland and Wales show comparatively lower ash presence in linear features.
- Ash as a hedgerow component is particularly important, not only as standard hedgerow trees but also as a component of hedgerows themselves.

## Individual trees and veteran trees

- 2.2 million ash trees outside woodlands (GB), including small clumps; most in England (≈1.82 million).
- Veteran ash trees (DbH > 2 m) are present but relatively few; many observed in mid-range diameter classes (1–2 m DbH), suggesting variability due to environment or coppicing history.

## Vegetation plots and changes over time

- Ash found in:
  - About 30% of hedgerow vegetation plots.
  - Other plot types including boundary plots, hedge plots, road verges, streamside plots, arable margins, and small habitat patches.
- Trends indicate increases in ash occupancy on linear features from 1978 to 2007 and in area plots from 1990 to 2007, suggesting a broad-scale expansion in recent decades.

## Further research and future work

- Develop monitoring protocols to capture the impact of tree diseases (e.g., ash dieback) on distribution and health.
- Create a linear product to scale from CS 1 km squares to national coverage, potentially integrating LIDAR and OS map data and Land Cover Map 2007 for improved accuracy.
- Conduct deeper analyses of vegetation plot data to determine ash associations with other plant species and to attribute distribution changes to abiotic drivers (climate, soil, dispersal).
- Explore complementary CS data with Forestry Commission data to better understand ash distribution in larger woodlands and potential interactions with elm loss (Dutch elm disease) over time.

## Data sources, limitations, and context

- Primary data source: Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) with broader methodological context from CS1990/1998/2007 cycles.
- CS focuses on current land cover rather than stocking status of woodlands (unlike NFI, which reports stocked areas); to avoid duplication, CS woodland parcels overlain by NFI were excluded from woodland-area estimates.
- Methods emphasize breadth over fine-grained spatial specificity; maps are based on landclass means and weighted proportions rather than precise geospatial ash distributions.
- The report frames ash distribution in the context of ash dieback concerns, while noting that future analyses should integrate explanatory drivers (climate, soils, dispersal) and disease dynamics to model future distribution and impact.

## Takeaway for decision-making and modeling

- Ash is a pervasive and significant component of GB countryside, concentrated in hedgerows and linear features, with substantial numbers outside woodlands.
- The CS dataset provides robust, scale-adjusted estimates suitable for baseline modeling of ash dieback impact, landscape-level habitat considerations, and identification of priority areas for monitoring and disease management.
- The integration of CS with other datasets (NFI, landclass, Land Cover Map 2007, and potential LIDAR data) offers a pathway to develop predictive models of ash distribution under future disease pressures and environmental change.
