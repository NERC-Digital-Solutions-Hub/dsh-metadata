# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the sampling strategy for the Countryside Survey field component up to 2007.
  - Traces the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its use as the sampling framework for GB-wide ecological surveys.
  - Emphasizes the linkage between sampling design, land classification, and time-series habitat estimates.

- Core concepts for data governance
  - Stratified, random sampling using the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
  - Use of 1 km squares as the primary sampling unit; classification-based strata guide square selection.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) as the foundational method for creating land classes (initially 32 classes; later expanded and refined).
  - Time-series continuity: framework is deliberately linked to predecessors, enabling change detection across surveys.

- Development trajectory of the ITE Land Classification
  - Early version (1978): 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes; classifier used to stratify GB and guide sampling.
  - 1984 update: sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total) to improve national estimates.
  - 1990 CS1990: classification revised to cover all GB squares; introduction of Land Cover Map from satellite data; 508 squares surveyed.
  - 1990s refinement: effort to classify every GB square with a practical, surrogate-based multi-variate approach; 62% correspondence with the original 1978 classes; adjustments affected class representation.
  - 2000 CS2000: to support England/Wales and Scotland reporting, land classes were subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata created; additional squares added; upland habitat sampling module introduced to improve upland estimates.
  - 2007 CS2007: Wales-focused reporting drive led to five Welsh sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); strata expanded to 45; Welsh sampling increased with 43 extra Welsh squares; England adjustments maintained overall precision; Wales emphasized for country-specific environmental policy needs.

- Survey rounds and sampling details
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - 8 squares per land class (256 total) within a classified framework of 6039 km squares.
    - National estimates built from mean habitat area per square times land-class area.
  - 1984 (Second GB land-use survey)
    - 12 squares per class (total 384); results contributed to change statistics across years.
  - 1990 (CS1990; All Squares Land Classification)
    - Requires classification of all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 quadrats plus land-use data.
    - Linked to first Land Cover Map; broader ecological and policy needs identified.
  - Post-1990 refinements
    - Full-sweep reclassification of GB squares using major climatic, geological, and physiographic factors; simulation indicated substantial but acceptable shifts in class representation.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Separate country estimates (England & Wales; Scotland) implemented; 40 strata; additional squares to represent new classes; upland module added for England & Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-specific reporting requirements drove country-unit sub-divisions; five new Welsh classes created; overall strata expanded to 45; Wales received targeted sampling increases to ensure six squares per new class.

- Country reporting and data outputs
  - England, Scotland, Wales: distinct reporting units introduced; adjustments to sampling to ensure robust country-specific estimates.
  - Tables and maps (e.g., CS2000 and CS2007 figures) illustrate the distribution of sample squares across strata and countries.
  - Note on national estimates: changing land-class schemes affects cross-survey consistency; preferred approach is to use the latest classification for country-level estimates while recognizing cross-survey comparability challenges.

- Practical governance implications for data stewards
  - Data lineage and versioning: classification changes over time require clear provenance and mapping between old and new land-class schemes.
  - Metadata requirements: detailed documentation of land-class definitions, sub-divisions, and sampling rates per survey year.
  - Interoperability and crosswalks: need for robust crosswalks to compare habitat area estimates across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
  - Country-specific reporting: devolution-driven adaptations necessitate maintaining separate strata and sample counts for England, Wales, and Scotland.
  - Data quality and transparency: explicit acknowledgement of how reclassification affects representation and estimates; maintain traceable notes on changes to methods and sampling allocations.
  - Time-series integrity: ensure datasets support longitudinal analyses by retaining original sampling frames while providing versioned classification schemes.
