# Countryside Survey 2007

- Purpose and significance
  - Provides hard scientific evidence on the health of the UK countryside to inform policy and land management decisions.
  - Builds a 30-year record of changes in habitats, vegetation, soils, and freshwater; supports broader programs like Living With Environmental Change.
  - Uses Broad Habitat and Priority Habitat classifications to monitor progress against UK biodiversity goals.

- Structure of the survey
  - Two main components:
    - Field Survey (this report): habitats, vegetation, soils (0–15 cm), and freshwater.
    - Land Cover Map (to be published in 2009): a digital satellite-based map.
  - Scope and sampling
    - Field Survey across 591 1 km x 1 km squares in England, Scotland, and Wales; supplementary data from ~0.5 km x 0.5 km Northern Ireland squares.
    - Data integrated to provide UK-wide estimates where possible.

- Habitat classification framework
  - Broad Habitats: 27 categories, used to quantify area and change in area across the countryside.
  - Priority Habitats: 65 designated as at-risk or ecologically critical; results presented for a limited set (e.g., Hedgerows, Ponds, Arable Field Margins) where feasible.
  - Land Classes: 45 classes used to stratify Great Britain for square selection; supported by 32 ITE Land Classes used to guide sampling.

- Field Survey components
  - Habitat and landscape feature mapping
    - All Broad and Priority Habitats mapped within each square; linear features (hedges, walls, fences, roads) recorded.
    - Minimum mappable units: 400 m2 for habitats; 20 m for linear features.
  - Vegetation sampling plots
    - Up to about 67 plots per square across various plot types to capture habitat diversity.
    - Data collected: plant species presence and percent cover; used to derive vegetation condition via Aggregate Classes (ACs).
    - Eight Aggregate Classes (AC1–AC8) describe vegetation condition (e.g., Crops and Weeds, Fertile/Infertile Grassland, Woody/Non-woody components, Moorland, Heath, etc.).
  - Soils (0–15 cm)
    - Five soil core samples per square to measure pH, carbon concentration, bulk density, and other indicators; sampling points vary across years for consistency.
    - pH and carbon concentration highlighted in this report; bulk density and other soil metrics discussed in full soils manual.
  - Freshwaters
    - Headwater streams assessed in 373 squares; macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, and River Habitat Survey (RHS) parameters collected in designated stretches.
    - Habitat Diversity and Habitat Quality Assessments (HQA) compiled; ponds sampled in 260 squares with plant-based condition criteria; PSYM used to rate pond quality in England/Wales.

- Data collection and management
  - Transition to electronic data capture in 2007 (field forms, GPS, GIS integration).
  - Bespoke GIS system (CEH/ESRI) with field laptops enabled real-time data checks, validation, and a centralized, georeferenced database linking mapping, vegetation plots, soils, and freshwater data.
  - Data and metadata intended to be discoverable via portals; datasets tracked to support reuse.

- Vegetation condition and measurement framework
  - Condition assessed via plots within Broad Habitats; measures summarized in Box 1.3 (e.g., Species Richness, Number of farmland/butterfly food plants, Grass:Forb Ratio, Competitor/Stress-tolerator/Ruderal scores, Light/Fertility/Ellenberg pH/Moisture indicators).
  - Long-term vegetation changes (1978–2007) tracked by reassigning plots to initial ACs (cohort approach) to follow changes over time.

- Data analysis and reporting
  - Statistical approach uses bootstrapping to quantify uncertainty with minimal assumptions.
  - Significance levels (P ≤ 0.05, with more stringent indicators where applicable) indicated in tables; results often show stronger significance (0.01 or 0.001) in figures.
  - Reporting framework includes:
    - Area and change in Broad Habitats (GB, country-levels, and UK with NI data).
    - Conversion flows between Broad Habitats (not strictly statistical estimates; indicate direction of change).
    - Condition of Broad Habitats (via vegetation plots) and vegetation ACs.
    - Long-term vegetation change (1978–2007) and Priority Habitats estimation.

- Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS)
  - Independent programme (University of Ulster) running parallel surveys, later integrated to provide UK-wide estimates.
  - 288 sample squares in NI (0.5% intensity in 2007) with adapted protocols and masks to differentiate upland/lowland and woodland types.
  - Data linked to GB data for UK reporting, with correspondence between Northern Ireland Primary Habitats and UK Broad Habitats refined.

- Priority Habitats estimation and masking
  - Spatial masks (SNH, JNCC, Natural England, Welsh Upland) used to delineate Priority Habitats across regions.
  - Back-allocation and viewing of habitat types across years (1998, 2007) to assess changes and national estimates.

- Limitations and interpretation notes
  - CS provides estimates, not absolute counts; extrapolation beyond intended scope requires caution.
  - Some Priority Habitats are underrepresented due to sampling constraints; results should be used alongside UK BAP figures.
  - Differences in classification and coding across years necessitate careful translation and back-compatibility considerations.

- Accessibility and contacts
  - Findings and methodological details are designed to be accessible to policy makers, researchers, and practitioners.
