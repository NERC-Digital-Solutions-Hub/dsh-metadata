# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Purpose and context
- Describes the development and application of the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey fieldwork up to 2007.
- Explains how the ITE Land Classification underpins stratified, random sampling to obtain representative national, regional, and country-specific estimates of countryside features.
- Emphasises that the current methodology is built on decades of prior work and remains linked to earlier surveys.

## The ITE Land Classification: foundation for stratification
- Originated in the 1970s to stratify land for national ecological surveys.
- Based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) rather than solely species data.
- Initial version classified 1 km squares into 32 Land Classes using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on a subset of squares; surrounding four squares per centre square were also allocated to classes.
- This stratification enabled representative sampling across Britain by combining objective random selection with ecological diversity.

## Evolution of the sampling framework by survey

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & first field survey)
  - ISA-based classification into 32 classes from 1228 centre squares (plus four surrounding squares).
  - Eight samples per class, total 256 squares.
  - National estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by area of the class.

- 1984 (Second field survey)
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per Land Class (total 384).
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
  - Land Classification updated to classify every 1 km square in GB (conservative revision); urban/sea corrections included.
  - 508 squares surveyed; both previously recorded features and repeat vegetation quadrats collected.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB project; national estimates based on the revised classification.

- 1998–2000 (Developments toward CS2000)
  - Realisation that a single GB-wide classification was needed for regional/local estimates; only surrogates could be classified for every square due to computing limits.
  - A new classification approach tested; best fit retained was close to the original, but some squares shifted classes, affecting distribution across classes.
  - Adjustments to the sampling framework to accommodate updated classification and to support separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales).

- CS2000 (Sampling for England & Wales, and Scotland)
  - Introduced separate country-unit reporting (England with Wales; Scotland).
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; some aggregations to ensure adequate representation, creating 40 strata.
  - Additional squares allocated to ensure representation of new classes (minimums per class).
  - An uplands module added to improve estimates for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - Summary tables/maps show the expanded and redistributed sample framework.

- CS2007 (Welsh-only reporting adjustments)
  - Wales required Wales-only habitat reporting post-devolution; English sampling adjustments were made to maintain precision where Welsh samples were added.
  - Land Classes subdivided into five new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares; some English classes retained lower sample counts (deemed acceptable by scoping studies).
  - Updated England, Wales, and Scotland sampling maps and tables reflect the Wales-focused reporting needs.

## Country-specific reporting, Isle of Man, and Welsh uplands
- England with Wales, Scotland: country-unit framing implemented; Isle of Man squares removed/replaced to keep country-unit consistency.
- Wales-specific adjustments: sub-divisions for Wales classes and increased Welsh sampling to support Wales-only estimates.
- Wales had greater emphasis on representation due to its land class composition (notably Land Class 17); Wales-specific sampling ensured adequate precision.

## Uplands module
- An additional module funded to sample upland and marginal upland classes more densely.
- Aimed to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates within the England and Wales framework.

## Outputs, interpretation, and data-friendly practices
- Survey results are structured around stratified sampling by Land Classes, with country-unit breakdowns and, in some years, upland modules.
- Tables and maps (e.g., sample square counts, strata distributions, and sampling rates) document how many squares were surveyed per class and per country.
- Important caveat: changing Land Classification across surveys affects cross-survey comparability; internally, latest classifications are preferred for consistency, while older classifications may support cross-survey comparability.

## Data quality, limitations, and methodological notes
- The 2006 scoping study notes that changing the basic classification used for national estimates can affect consistency of stock estimates; within-survey consistency favors the latest classification, while cross-survey consistency benefits from the original scheme.
- Representativeness and precision depend on adequate sample sizes per class and country; Wales required more intensive sampling to enable Wales-only estimates.
- Some classes in England saw reduced sample counts in CS2007 due to Wales-focused sampling, with minimal impact on English estimate precision per scoping study.
