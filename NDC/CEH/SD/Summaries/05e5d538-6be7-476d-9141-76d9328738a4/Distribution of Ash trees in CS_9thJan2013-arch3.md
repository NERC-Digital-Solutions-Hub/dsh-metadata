# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- Purpose: Assess the extent and distribution of ash (Fraxinus excelsior) in Great Britain to inform understanding of potential impacts (notably ash dieback) by using Countryside Survey (CS) data as a national audit of countryside resources.

- Data sources and design:
  - Countryside Survey 1 km square stratified random sampling across GB, aligned with land classes and ecological gradients.
  - Excluded woodland parcels already captured by the National Forestry Inventory to avoid duplication; focused on woodlands <0.5 ha and other landscape components.
  - Multiple data streams to quantify ash: areas in woodlands <0.5 ha, individual trees outside woodland, ash in woody linear features (hedgerows, lines of trees, belts), and vegetation plots.

- Methods by data type:
  - Areas in woodlands <0.5 ha: estimated ash extent using percent cover per 1 km square, then upscaled to national totals; includes confidence intervals and cross-checks with NFI data.
  - Individual trees outside woodland: counted outside woodland and in small clumps; recorded modal trunk diameter; included veteran trees; national estimates derived from per-square data.
  - Woody linear features: ash proportion in hedgerows, lines of trees, and belts; used D plots (hedgerow vegetation plots) to estimate species cover and scaled by land class to national totals.
  - Vegetation plots: assessed occupancy and mean cover of ash across various plot types (linear vs area-based plots) to understand habitat distribution and change.
  - Trend analysis: tracked changes in ash occupancy from 1978 to 2007 for linear plots and from 1990 to 2007 for area plots, using change indices.

- Key findings:
  - Ash in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha: estimated at 38.5 thousand hectares; ash is the second most abundant tree in these patches after oak; England hosts most (32.1k ha), followed by Scotland (4.4k ha) and Wales (2.0k ha).
  - England shows the highest ash extent among countries; Scotland emphasizes birch as more abundant than ash, with oak also prominent in some areas.
  - Outside woodland: ~2.2 million ash trees; England hosts the majority (about 1.8 million), with Scotland and Wales having smaller numbers.
  - Individual ash trees and age: most individuals are small to mid-size (<1 m diameter at breast height in many cases), with few veteran trees.
  - Hedgerows and linear features: ash is the most common hedgerow tree species; total ash-in-woodland linear features estimated at 98,900 km (mostly hedgerows in England: ~66,300 km; lines of trees ~19,700 km; belts minimal).
  - Distribution within landscapes: ash found across fields, field boundaries, streams, and hedgerows; hedgerows and streamsides are particularly important habitats for ash.
  - Vegetation plots: ash present in about 30% of hedgerow plots; occupancy varies by plot type, with notable presence along hedges, streamside, and boundary features.
  - Changes over time: ash occupancy increased on linear features from 1978 to 2007 and increased on area plots from 1990 to 2007, indicating a broader spread across landscapes.

- Spatial interpretation and uncertainty:
  - Generated maps indicate ash is most abundant in southeast England; maps are indicative rather than precisely spatially explicit due to methodological scaling and reliance on landclass means.
  - National estimates include confidence intervals to reflect sampling and upscaling uncertainties.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy:
  - Demonstrates a multi-tiered monitoring approach: combining area estimates, point (individual tree) data, and linear-feature metrics to capture comprehensive distribution.
  - Enables tracking of species distribution changes over time and across landscape components, informing disease risk assessment (e.g., ash dieback) and management responses.
  - Supports development of enhanced monitoring products (e.g., linear corridor products) by integrating CS data with other geospatial datasets (LIDAR, OS maps, Land Cover maps).
  - Highlights data governance considerations: the need to share underlying data publicly while ensuring quality, metadata, and data management standards are maintained.

- Limitations and future work:
  - Current focus on ash distribution; further monitoring could incorporate disease impact, damage, and mortality.
  - Potential complementarity with Forestry Commission data to extend coverage within larger woodlands, though differences in definitions (current land cover vs. stocked woodland) require careful reconciliation.
  - Future work suggested: development of a linear product combining CS field data with LIDAR and land cover data; analyses linking ash distribution to abiotic drivers (climate, soil, deposition) and potential explanatory variables; leveraging GB woodland survey data to assess elm loss effects and indirect impacts on ash associations.
