# Countryside Survey 2007

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the rationale, methods, and data collected for Countryside Survey (CS) in 2007 and previous surveys.
  - Two main components: Field Survey (habitats, vegetation, soils, and freshwater) and Land Cover Map (satellite-based digital map to be published 2009).
  - Provides a 30-year time series of countryside changes; UK-wide synthesis with Northern Ireland data included.

- Two-part structure and outputs
  - Field Survey: national and regional estimates of Broad Habitats, selected Priority Habitats, vegetation condition, landscape features, and freshwater habitats.
  - Land Cover Map: satellite-derived digital map of land cover to be released separately.
  - Outputs include area estimates, changes in area, vegetation condition, and landscape feature metrics; data intended for policy and planning use.

- Sampling design and coverage
  - Field Survey surveyed 591 1km x 1km sample squares across England, Scotland, and Wales (289 England, 107 Wales, 195 Scotland); 0.5km x 0.5km squares in Northern Ireland (NICS, 628 squares in 1998; 288 squares in 2007).
  - Sampling stratified by 32 ITE Land Classes; aims for representative coverage of climate and geology variations.
  - Repeated sampling: effort to reuse the same squares over time; a statistical model (bootstrapping) used to infer missing values and enable year-to-year comparisons across the full dataset.

- Data collection and field methods
  - Habitat and landscape feature mapping: Broad and Priority Habitats mapped within each square using a standardized key; minimum mappable areas defined; polygons created for each habitat; linear features (hedges, walls, fences, roads, etc.) recorded.
  - Vegetation sampling: up to 67 plots per square across various plot types (Main Plots and targeted plots) to capture vegetation composition and cover; data entered electronically in the field; plots fixed in space to enable tracking changes over time.
  - Soil sampling (0-15 cm): five plots per square sampled for pH, organic carbon (via loss on ignition), bulk density, and related analyses.
  - Freshwater sampling: headwater streams and ponds sampled in selected squares; includes macroinvertebrate assessment, aquatic plant surveys, and River Habitat Survey (RHS) for physical habitat complexity; Pond assessments using PSYM (pond quality index) and plant-based metrics.

- Data processing and management
  - Field mapping and data capture conducted with a custom GIS system (CEH/ESRI) on rugged laptops; GPS used to relocate plots; data uploaded via a web-based data management system.
  - Integrated database links habitat polygons, vegetation plots, soil cores, and freshwater data to enable cross-parameter analysis.
  - Higher-level interpretation includes estimations of habitat extents, condition, and landscape change over time.

- Habitat classification and reporting
  - Broad Habitat framework: 45 Land Classes used to derive Broad Habitats; Priority Habitats identified under UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP).
  - Reporting framework provides UK (GB) and country-level results, with separate country reports planned for England, Scotland, and Wales.
  - Conversion between Broad Habitats tracked (not a formal statistical estimate but a directional flow of habitat change 1998–2007).

- Measures of vegetation condition and indicators
  - Aggregate Classes (ACs): eight ACs defined to summarize vegetation condition across plots (e.g., Crops and Weeds; Fertile/Infertile Grassland; Lowland/Upland Wooded; Moorland/Mosaic; Heath and Bog).
  - Box 1.3 outlines measures used to quantify vegetation condition, including species richness, habitat-associated food plant counts, Grass:Forb ratio, Competitor/Stressor/Ruderal scores, Light, Fertility, Ellenberg pH, and Moisture scores.

- Priority habitats and spatial masking
  - Priority Habitats are identified and analyzed where feasible; 65 Priority Habitats recognized in the UK; some are underrepresented in the CS sample.
  - Post-survey spatial masks (e.g., SNH, JNCC, Natural England, Welsh upland mask) used to delineate upland/lowland and other zone distinctions for national estimates.

- Northern Ireland integration (NICS)
  - NICS conducted independently (1998 baseline, 2007 follow-up) with analogous habitat mapping and data collection, then aligned with UK Broad Habitat definitions.
  - Data combined to form UK-wide Broad Habitat estimates; method includes region-specific masks and updated classifications.

- Data quality, significance, and interpretation
  - Significance testing: standard 0.05 level used; arrows indicate direction of change; asterisks denote stronger significance (0.01, 0.001).
  - Caution in interpretation: CS provides estimates based on sampling and models; extrapolation beyond the survey design should be approached with care.
  - Emphasis on long-term comparisons and the detection of habitat change, vegetation condition shifts, and changes in linear features and freshwater bodies.

- Notable analytic components and tools
  - Box 1.2 PSYM: pond quality assessment integrating plant and invertebrate data (plant-based in CS 2007); yields a pond condition classification (Very Poor–Good).
  - Box 1.3 Vegetation measures: multi-mactor reads for diversity, habitat importance, and plant strategy metrics (Competitor, Stress-tolerator, Ruderal, Light, Fertility, Ellenberg pH, Moisture).
