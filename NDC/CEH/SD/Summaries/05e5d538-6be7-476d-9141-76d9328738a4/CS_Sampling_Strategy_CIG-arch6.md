# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and core idea
  - Establishes how Countryside Survey field data are collected and how ecological information is stratified and sampled across Great Britain.
  - Uses the ITE Land Classification to create strata that ensure representative, unbiased sampling of diverse landscapes.
  - Aims to support reliable, time-series estimates of habitat and land-use features, enabling national, regional, and country-specific reporting.

- Key concepts: stratified sampling and land classification
  - Stratification is used to divide GB into discreet land classes (strata) to reduce bias and ensure typical representation of variability.
  - Initial approach built on a 1 km square sampling unit, chosen for practicality and ecological representativeness.
  - Land Classification evolved from using environmental attributes to more comprehensive, country-specific classifications over time (32 → 40 → 45 strata).

- Evolution of the sampling framework (timeline highlights)
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes; centres of a 15 x 15 km grid used to select 1 km squares.
    - Eight samples per class selected at random, totaling 256 1 km squares.
    - Field surveys focused on vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
  - 1984 (Second GB survey)
    - Sample size increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (384 total).
    - National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Land Classification updated to classify every GB square; urban/sea corrections applied.
    - 508 squares surveyed; added a Land Cover Map from satellite data; repeat of 1978 quadrats.
  - 1998/2000 (Revised Classification for CS2000)
    - Classification expanded to enable Scotland-only reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
    - Adjusted sampling to produce separate country estimates (England & Wales; Scotland).
    - 13477 GB squares represented, with adjustments; upland habitat sampling module added later to bolster upland estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Wales-specific reporting)
    - Devolution-driven need for Wales-only results; Wales becomes more heavily sampled.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating five new Welsh/England sub-classes), expanding strata to 45.
    - Additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure adequate representation; some English classes reduced (e.g., 4 squares per class in two English classes).
    - A Wales uplands module supported Wales-specific habitat estimates; overall CS2007 surveyed 591 squares (England & Wales combined) across 45 strata.

- Country-specific reporting and data framework
  - CS2000 introduced England with Wales and Scotland country units, requiring country-focused strata and sampling rules.
  - Adjustments included class subdivison by country unit, aggregation where necessary, and targeted additional squares to ensure balanced representation across countries.
  - Wales-specific sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) introduced to refine Wales results.

- Uplands module and targeted sampling
  - CS2000 included a dedicated uplands module (30 additional squares in upland/marginal upland classes) to improve precision for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Data products, outputs, and reporting
  - Core outputs include national and country-level habitat estimates derived from the sampling framework.
  - Key published reports:
    - Countryside Survey 1990: main report
    - Accounting for nature: assessing habitats in the UK countryside (CS2000)
    - Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007 (CS2007)
  - Land Classification maps accompany each survey (e.g., England with Wales and Scotland maps for CS2000; revised maps for CS2007).

- National estimates: methodology and considerations
  - National estimates are calculated by integrating per-square habitat data within each Land Class and scaling by the land area of each class.
  - Changing the basic Land Classification across surveys affects the consistency of stock estimates; the preferred approach for a given survey aligns with the latest classification, though cross-survey comparability may vary.
