# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the field sampling strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
- Centers on the ITE Land Classification as the stratification framework for GB-wide ecological surveying.
- Demonstrates how sampling design supports time-series analysis and policy-relevant environmental monitoring.
- Tracks methodological changes to accommodate devolution, country-specific reporting, upland habitats, and data integrity across surveys.

## Core concepts and purpose
- Stratified random sampling: to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage of GB land types.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to create land classes that drive sample allocation.
- 1 km square survey units: chosen as a balance between field practicality and ecological differentiation.
- Purpose of outputs: national and country-level estimates of habitat areas, land-use features, and related ecological attributes; data products include maps, tables, and reports.
- Data governance: emphasis on storing and uploading datasets to appropriate portals for reuse and audit.

## Development timeline and key changes

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and first field survey
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to define 32 land classes from 1228 central 1 km squares; four surrounding squares classified as well.
  - Sample framework: 8 squares per class, total 256; focus on vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
  - National estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class, multiplied by class area.

- 1984 – Second GB survey (land use focus)
  - Used the same sampling framework but increased the sample by 50% (12 squares per class; total 384).
  - Aimed at land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping; results partially published.

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) and all-squares Land Classification
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data for every GB square; urban and sea corrections included.
  - Field survey: 508 squares; repeated 1978/1984 measurements plus added coverage.
  - Results linked to the first GB land-cover map; national estimates based on a broader classification.

- 1998 – CS2000: revised classification and separate country estimates
  - Expanded to classify all GB squares using major climatic, geological, and physiographic surrogates.
  - Original 32 classes expanded to 40; but cross-country boundary issues emerged, prompting country-focused reporting.
  - Changes to sampling: land classes subdivided into country-unit versions (England & Wales; Scotland); aggregation and additional samples to ensure representation; 19 extra squares to support new classes; Wales received enhanced sampling due to policy needs.
  - Introduction of “separate country estimates” and adjustments to ensure adequate representation in Wales (and Scotland when relevant).

- 2007 – CS2007: Wales-only reporting and further framework refinements
  - Wales required more robust Wales-only estimates; England and Wales sampling refined with country-unit sub-divisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), creating 45 strata.
  - Added 43 Welsh sample squares; in England two classes (5e, 15e) remained at lower sampling density due to precision considerations.
  - Revised class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland; updated sampling grid and maps for CS2007.
  - Table 3 summarizes the 2007 sampling allocations by class and country.

## Country-specific reporting and upland focus

- Separate country estimates
  - CS1990 had England, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man data drawn from the same 32 land classes, ignoring country boundaries.
  - CS2000 introduced country-unit subdivisions to support England & Wales and Scotland-specific reporting; additional samples allocated to ensure representation of new classes.
  - Wales-focused adjustments increased Welsh squares and enabled Wales-only reporting, with careful handling of class sub-divisions and aggregations.

- Uplands module (CS2000)
  - Added 30 squares in upland/marginal upland areas to improve habitat estimates for these regions.
  - Enhanced statistical accuracy for upland habitats within country-based reporting.

## Data outputs and estimation approach

- National estimates
  - Across surveys, national estimates are derived by applying mean habitat area per square within each Land Class to the area of that class, with adjustments for changes in Land Classification across surveys.
  - Note on consistency: changing the basic Land Classification affects national estimates; CS2006 scoping highlighted a trade-off between using the latest classification for within-survey consistency and cross-survey comparability.

- Tables and figures
  - Tables track the number of squares by class, country, and survey year; totals and sampling rates are provided.
  - Maps illustrate the Land Classification and sample square locations across GB and within England, Wales, and Scotland.
  - Appendix I and subsequent sections provide a brief history of the ITE Land Classification and the evolution of its application to Countryside Survey.

## Methodological considerations and challenges

- Stratification rationale
  - Strata are formed by combining environmental attributes to capture distinct ecological affinities; this reduces sampling error and ensures representative coverage.
- Representation and precision
  - Adjustments to address under-representation of certain classes in particular countries (notably Wales) and to enhance precision for country-specific estimates.
- Data continuity and comparability
  - Balancing continuity with methodological improvements; decisions about using the original 1990 classification versus latest classifications depend on the need for cross-survey comparability and national estimates.

## Practical implications for environmental monitoring

- Standardised framework enables consistent monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- The ITE Land Classification provides a robust, hierarchical stratification that supports comparing habitat and land-use indicators across decades.
- Country-specific adaptations (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales-only reporting) improve policy-relevant insights at sub-national scales.
- Upland modules and expanded Welsh sampling enhance reliability for regional habitat monitoring and targeted conservation planning.
