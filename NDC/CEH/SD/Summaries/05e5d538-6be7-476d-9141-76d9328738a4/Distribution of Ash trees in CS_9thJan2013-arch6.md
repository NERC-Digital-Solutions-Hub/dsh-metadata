# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- A Countryside Survey assessment of the extent and distribution of ash trees to inform potential impacts of ash dieback and to understand how ash is spread across landscapes beyond total area.
- Uses CS data (1 km square sampling across GB) combined with other datasets to estimate ash in small woodlands, as individual trees, and within woody linear features, plus changes over time.

## Aims and context

- Determine the extent and spatial distribution of Fraxinus excelsior in the countryside, not only total area but where ash occurs (woodlands, hedgerows, streamsides, fields) to assess potential dieback impacts.
- Focus on ash in woodlands smaller than 0.5 ha, and examine ash in linear features and as individual trees to capture landscape-scale patterns.

## Data and methods

- Data sources and design
  - Countryside Survey (CS) uses stratified random sampling of 1 km squares across GB, aligned with ecological landclasses and gradients.
  - Overlays and cross-checks with the National Forest Inventory (NFI) to avoid duplication, focusing on woodlands <0.5 ha not sampled by NFI.
  - Data are drawn from landclass distributions, percentage cover categories, and CS vegetation plots.
- Areas (woodlands <0.5 ha)
  - Ash presence estimated from percentage cover per 1 km square; area estimates aggregated across landclasses to GB totals.
- Individual trees outside woodland
  - Record number and modal diameter at breast height (DbH); include small clumps; collect veteran-tree data (up to 10 per 1 km square).
- Hedgerow and woody linear features
  - Linear features <5 m wide (hedgerows, belts, lines of trees) mapped with minimum 20 m length, allowing gaps.
  - Ash proportion estimated within woody features using proportion bands and, for hedges, field data from D plots (hedge diversity plots) to derive mean ash length.
- Vegetation plots
  - Various plot types along linear features and in fields/biotopes to assess ash occupancy and mean cover.
- Analysis and outputs
  - National estimates produced by weighting mean ash cover per landclass by area; results presented as areal extents (ha), number of trees, and length of ash-containing linear features.
  - Spatial illustrations produced using landclass means and, where possible, Land Cover Map 2007 data.

## Key findings

- Areal extent in small woodlands
  - Ash in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha: 38.51 thousand ha (GB).
  - England: 32.07 thousand ha; Scotland: 4.44 thousand ha; Wales: 1.99 thousand ha.
  - Ash is the second most abundant species in small woodland patches after oak.
- Individual trees outside woodland
  - Estimated 2.2 million ash trees outside woodlands in GB; England ~1.82 million; Scotland ~147k; Wales ~240k.
- Hedgerow trees
  - Ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species; oak is the second.
- Woody linear features
  - Ash-containing woody linear features total ~98.9 thousand km across GB, with the majority in England (86.1 thousand km; hedgerows 66.3 thousand km; lines of trees 19.7 thousand km; belts ~0.1 thousand km).
- Vegetation plots
  - Ash present in 30% of hedgerow plots (D plots, hedgerow plots, boundary plots, etc.).
- Distribution patterns
  - Ash is found in fields, field boundaries, streamsides, hedgerows, and is especially common in hedgerows.
- Change over time
  - Ash has increased on linear features from 1978 to 2007 (significant in linear plots).
  - Ash area plots increased between 1990 and 2007.
- Size and age distribution
  - Most ash trees are small to medium in diameter (DbH largely between 21–50 cm); veteran trees are rare, though present.

## Distribution and visualization insights

- Maps show ash concentration is higher in south-eastern England and lower in north-west Scotland, with the density varying by landclass and woodland presence.
- The analysis distinguishes between landscape components (small woodland patches, hedgerows, streamsides, fields) to illuminate where ash contributes most to landscape structure and potential ecological impacts.

## Discussion and implications for data use

- The study demonstrates the value of integrating CS field data with other datasets (NFI, Land Cover Map) to produce regional and national estimates of ash distribution and to generate products that support risk assessment for ash dieback.
- It highlights ash as a major component of the countryside, particularly as a hedgerow tree and a key constituent of hedgerows and lineal features.
- Limitations include the lack of a single high-resolution spatially explicit map for all ash presence and the challenge of attributing distribution to driving factors; however, the methods provide a foundation for exploring disease impacts and landscape-scale responses.

## Future work and data opportunities

- Develop monitoring protocols to capture tree diseases and mortality within CS.
- Expand linear-product development to scale from 1 km squares to national coverage (potential integration with LIDAR, OS maps, and Land Cover Map 2007).
- Further analyses of CS plot data and cross-dataset comparisons (e.g., with GB woodland survey data) to investigate ash associations and potential indirect effects on co-occurring species.
- Investigate drivers (climate, soil, dispersal) and model future ash distribution under disease pressures (e.g., Chalara fraxinea) and other factors.
- Enhance complementarity with Forestry Commission data and consider extending measurements (e.g., veteran trees, DbH in woodlands) to improve comparability and coverage.
