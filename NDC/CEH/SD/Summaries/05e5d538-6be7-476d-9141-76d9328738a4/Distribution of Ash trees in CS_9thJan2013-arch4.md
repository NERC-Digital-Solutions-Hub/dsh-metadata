# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

## Overview and purpose
- Countryside Survey (CS) is a long-running UK countryside resource audit (since 1978) using rigorous methods to enable temporal comparisons.
- This report estimates: 
  - area of ash trees in Great Britain in woodlands <0.5 ha
  - number of individual ash trees outside woodland
  - extent of ash in linear features (hedgerows, lines of trees)
  - trends in ash distribution in fixed vegetation plots
- Provides areal estimates for other broadleaf species for context.
- Aims to inform potential impacts of ash dieback by understanding current extent and distribution.

## Data sources and methodology
- Sampling design: stratified random sampling of 1 km2 squares across GB; uses landclasses and ecological gradients to scale up results.
- Areas (woodlands <0.5 ha): maps ash presence within CS parcels, overlays with National Forestry Inventory (NFI) data to avoid duplication; CS reflects current land cover rather than stocked woodland status.
- Individual trees outside woodland: recorded per 1 km2 square; includes small clumps (below 20 m × 20 m minimum mappable unit) and up to 10 veteran trees per square with extra attributes.
- Woody linear features (hedgerows and lines of trees): measured for ash proportion along lines; calculations use midpoint proportions and stratified means by landclass; includes belts and hedgerows with different recording methods for natural vs unnaturally shaped features.
- Vegetation plots: nested plot design (1 × 10 m linear plots, 2 × 2 m plots for unenclosed land and patches, larger nested plots) to assess ash occupancy and cover over time.
- Data processing: national estimates derived by weighting per landclass area; 32 landclasses used for GB scaling; confidence intervals reported.
- Change assessment: occupancy changes across vegetation plots between 1978 and 2007 (linear plots) and 1990–2007 (area plots).

## Key findings (extent, abundance, and distribution)
- Areal extent in woodlands <0.5 ha: ash comprises 38.51 thousand hectares; ash is the second most abundant broadleaf species in these small patches after oak.
- Geographic pattern: ash is most abundant in England (≈32.1 thousand ha) and much less in Scotland (≈4.4 thousand ha) and Wales (≈2.0 thousand ha).
- Individual trees outside woodland: estimated 2.2 million ash trees outside woodlands; England contains the majority (≈1.8 million).
- Ash as a hedgerow tree: ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species.
- Linear features: estimated total ash in woody linear features is 98.9 thousand kilometers, with the vast majority in hedgerows (≈75.1 thousand km) and a substantial component in lines of trees (≈23.6 thousand km); Wales and Scotland show lower frequencies than England.
- Density and size: most individual ash trees are small to mid-sized (DbH 21–50 cm); veteran trees are rare.
- Vegetation plots: ash present in about 30% of hedgerow plots; ash occurs across several plot types, with notable presence along roadsides and streamside margins.
- Temporal changes: ash occupancy increased on linear features from 1978 to 2007 and increased in area plots from 1990 to 2007, indicating a broad expansion across the landscape.

## Spatial distribution and visualization
- Distribution maps approximate ash abundance by landclass across GB; highest density in southeast England; maps are indicative rather than precise spatial maps due to scaling and data limitations.
- Appendix-style maps cover other broadleaved species for comparative context.

## Implications for data strategy and governance
- Demonstrates value of integrating CS data with NFI datasets to avoid duplication and to derive national-scale estimates.
- Uses standardized percentage cover bands and midpoints for scale-up, enabling cross-study comparability and future trend analysis.
- Establishes a framework for developing linear products that combine CS field data with LiDAR, OS maps, and Land Cover Map data to improve linear-feature representations.
- Highlights data gaps and uncertainties: reliance on sampling design, confidence intervals, and limitations in spatially explicit mapping at national scale.
- Potential to link ash distribution with explanatory variables (climate, soils, deposition) to model future distribution and disease impact (ash dieback).

## Future work and recommendations
- Develop monitoring protocols for tree diseases and mortality within CS to track ash dieback alongside distribution metrics.
- Expand linear-feature products to scale from 1 km² squares to GB-wide coverage.
- Extend analyses of vegetation plot data to identify species associations with ash and potential ecological impacts of ash loss.
- Explore complementary analyses with other datasets (e.g., GB woodland survey) to attribute distribution changes to drivers (abiotic factors, disease pressure).
- Integrate ash data with models of future distribution under disease scenarios to inform policy and management decisions.

## Conclusion
- Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is a significant component of the British countryside, especially in hedgerows and small woodland patches.
- The Countryside Survey provides robust, scalable estimates of ash extent, density, and distribution, including trends over time and clear pathways for integrating with other data sources and advancing linear-feature mapping.
- The dataset lays groundwork for monitoring the potential impacts of ash dieback and for exploring driving factors behind ash distribution across landscapes.
