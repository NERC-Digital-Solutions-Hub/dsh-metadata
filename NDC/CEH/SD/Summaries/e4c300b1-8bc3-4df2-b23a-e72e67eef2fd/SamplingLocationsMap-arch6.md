- Data use considerations
  - Useful as a canonical reference for translating codes into readable site descriptions in dashboards, reports, and data joins.
  - Facilitates standardisation when integrating multiple datasets with varying naming conventions.

- Next steps for data support
  - Validate mappings against an authoritative data dictionary.
  - Augment with metadata: coordinates (lat/long), river/basin identifiers, measurement types, data availability dates.
  - Incorporate into a data catalog and ensure consistency across downstream analyses and visualisations.
