## Data insights for Data Leaders
- The list functions as a centralized index of river gauge sites with concise identifiers and human-readable locations.
- It highlights a focus on the Thames and its tributaries, plus a few adjacent watercourses (e.g., Jubilee River, Cut).
- Each entry ties a short code to a specific site, enabling consistent referencing across datasets and analyses.

## Recommendations for data governance
- Create a standardized metadata schema to accompany each site (coordinates, measurement types, frequency, data availability, data steward).
- Ensure unique identifiers remain stable across system updates and data exports.
- Link these site entries to broader data catalogs and discovery tools to improve discoverability and reduce duplication of effort.
- Establish a process for updating site information when locations or site names change, and for noting data access constraints (e.g., paywalls, permissions).
