## Context and Purpose
- Provides a standardized index of monitoring sites to support consistent environmental health assessments over time.
- Aligns with data management practices: data required from established sources, verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation.
- Outputs are presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and datasets are stored in appropriate data portals.

## Relevance to Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Enables systematic monitoring across multiple rivers and tributaries.
- Facilitates cross-site comparisons and longitudinal analyses for policy performance and environmental health.

## Challenges and Opportunities
- Increase the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data sources (avoid single-use data).
- Improve access to the underlying data used to produce final outputs.
