# Management policies for invasive alien species: Addressing the impacts rather than the species

- Purpose and scope
  - Literature review examining management policies for invasive alien species (IAS) with a focus on addressing IAS impacts rather than the species themselves.
  - Aims to synthesize evidence on control efficacy and outcomes across interventions.

- Data collection and screening
  - Source: Web of Science search for the phrase "invasive species control efficacy."
  - Timeframe: 27 May 2020 to 10 July 2020.
  - Initial yield: 682 publications.
  - Exclusions: biofouling and ballast water studies (focus on prevention of new introductions rather than control of established populations); laboratory-only experiments excluded; aquarium, greenhouse, and mesocosm studies retained as they can inform IAS control outcomes.
  - Screening: 373 publications assessed as relevant after applying criteria.
  - Screening focus: title, authors, journal, year, taxa, control method type, and whether outcomes of control were evaluated.

- Dataset contents
  - File: WOS-ControlSearchFinal.csv
    - A CSV containing one row per relevant study identified in the search/screening process.

- Dataset fields (column explanations)
  - Title: title of the study.
  - Authors: authors of the study.
  - Journal: journal in which the study was published.
  - Year: publication year.
  - Taxa: taxa targeted by the control intervention.
  - Type: control method utilized.
  - Outcomes - not including non-target & side effects: YES if the study evaluated outcomes of control with respect to IAS impacts, NO otherwise.
  - Outcomes - including non-target & side effects: YES if the study evaluated outcomes considering non-target effects and other side effects, NO otherwise.
  - Notes: The outcomes columns indicate whether evaluations included broader ecological or collateral effects.

- Data characteristics and provenance
  - The dataset represents published, accessible studies (freely available data) and is curated by Pablo García-Díaz (with contact details provided).
  - Data are structured to enable assessment of how effectively IAS controls addresses impacts, and whether broader ecological consequences were evaluated.

- Implications for data leadership and usage
  - Supports the data system perspective by providing a structured, discoverable dataset that links study metadata with outcomes on efficacy and side effects.
  - Useful for informing policy analysis, prioritization of control strategies, and identification of knowledge gaps (e.g., studies that evaluate outcomes vs. those that do not, and whether non-target effects are addressed).
  - Demonstrates importance of metadata, provenance, and clear definitions of outcome measures for reproducibility and re-use.
  - Open access nature facilitates collaboration and cross-network data sharing; highlights the value of a centralized repository of study-level control efficacy data.

- Limitations and considerations
  - Focused on published Web of Science literature and specific exclusions; may not capture grey literature or non-indexed sources.
  - Excludes laboratory-only studies; reliance on available abstracts/titles for screening may influence depth of metadata.
  - Outcome measures depend on individual study reporting; variability in definitions of “outcomes” and “non-target effects” may affect comparability.
