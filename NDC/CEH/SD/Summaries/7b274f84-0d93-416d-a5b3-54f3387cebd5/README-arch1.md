# Management policies for invasive alien species: Addressing the impacts rather than the species

## Aim
- Conduct a literature review (Web of Science) to evaluate the efficacy of control interventions for invasive alien species (IAS) in terms of addressing their impacts, not just the species.
- Synthesize how studies measure outcomes and whether they include non-target and side effects.

## Methods
- Literature search focused on the keyword group "invasive species control efficacy."
- Screening window: 27 May 2020 to 10 July 2020; conducted by Pablo García-Díaz.
- Initial set: 682 publications; exclusions applied to biofouling and ballast-water topics (focused on preventing new IAS releases rather than controlling established populations).
- Lab-only experiments excluded; aquarium, greenhouse, and mesocosm experiments retained for their relevance to IAS impacts and control-outcome relationships.
- Final inclusion: 373 publications assessed as relevant.
- Data extraction: for each study, captured title, authors, journal, year, taxa, type of control method, and whether outcomes (overall impact outcomes and non-target/side effects) were evaluated.

## Data file and contents
- File: WOS-ControlSearchFinal.csv (CSV) containing the results of the search and screening.
- Each row represents one relevant study.
- Columns include:
  - Title
  - Authors
  - Journal
  - Year
  - Taxa (taxa targeted by the control intervention)
  - Type (control method)
  - Outcomes - not including non-target & side effects (YES/NO)
  - Outcomes - including non-target & side effects (YES/NO)

## Data scope and exclusions
- Excluded: laboratory-only experiments.
- Included: aquarium, greenhouse, and mesocosm experiments appropriate for assessing IAS impacts and the relationship between control and outcomes.

## Data availability and accessibility
- Freely available data.
- The dataset provides structured, study-level information to analyze control efficacy and impact-related outcomes.

## Practical implications for analysts
- Enables examination of correlations between control methods, targeted taxa, and reported outcomes.
- Highlights the extent to which studies address non-target and side effects.
- Supports policy and decision-making by emphasizing outcomes and impacts rather than solely species-focused approaches.
