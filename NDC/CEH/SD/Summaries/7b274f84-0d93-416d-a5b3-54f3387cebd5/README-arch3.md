# Management policies for invasive alien species: Addressing the impacts rather than the species. BioScience.

## Overview
- This work conducts a systematic literature review to assess how effectively invasive species control translates into reducing ecological impacts, rather than focusing solely on species eradication or control.
- Emphasizes the importance of outcome-based metrics to inform management decisions and policy.

## Methods
- Literature search conducted in Web of Science using the keyword “invasive species control efficacy.”
- Timeframe: May 27, 2020 to July 10, 2020; led by Pablo García-Díaz.
- Initial yield: 682 publications; exclusions applied to focus on established populations and practical management.
- Exclusions:
  - Biofouling and ballast water studies (address prevention of new introductions, not control of established populations).
  - Laboratory-only experiments excluded; aquarium, greenhouse, and mesocosm studies retained for relevance to IAS impacts and control-outcome relationships.
- Final relevance: 373 publications assessed for information on title, authors, journal, year, taxa, control method, and whether outcomes were evaluated.

## Contents / Data product
- Product: A CSV file (WOS-ControlSearchFinal.csv) containing per-study results from the Web of Science search and screening.
- Columns include:
  - Title
  - Authors
  - Journal
  - Year
  - Taxa (taxa targeted by the control intervention)
  - Type (control method)
  - Outcomes - not including non-target & side effects (YES/NO)
  - Outcomes - including non-target & side effects (YES/NO)
- The file provides explicit explanations for each column, clarifying which outcomes were considered (i.e., whether the control addressed IAS impacts and whether non-target or side effects were evaluated).

## Data and governance implications for monitoring
- The dataset is freely available, supporting transparent, reproducible monitoring and evaluation.
- By cataloging whether studies report impact outcomes and potential non-target effects, the work highlights gaps in evidence and the quality of outcome reporting.
- The structured metadata enables cross-study comparisons across taxa, control methods, and observed impacts, informing policy decisions and prioritization of data collection.
- Highlights the importance of capturing not only control success but also downstream ecological consequences and data provenance.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a shift toward outcome-focused indicators for environmental health monitoring, aligning with the need to assess policy effectiveness rather than solely process measures.
- Underlines data challenges relevant to monitoring:
  - Variability in outcome reporting and study design.
  - The necessity of clear metadata and accessible data to verify and compare results.
  - The value of openly shared datasets to reduce duplication and improve governance of monitoring data.
