# Management policies for invasive alien species: Addressing the impacts rather than the species. BioScience

## Aim and scope
- Literature review focused on invasive species control efficacy.
- Policy emphasis on addressing environmental impacts rather than the identity of the invasive species.

## Methods
- Literature search conducted in Web of Science using keywords 'invasive species control efficacy'.
- Timeframe: 27 May 2020 to 10 July 2020; conducted by Pablo García-Díaz.
- Initial yield: 682 publications; exclusions applied to biofouling and ballast water (focused on preventing new introductions rather than controlling established populations).
- Laboratory-only experiments excluded; aquarium, greenhouse, and mesocosm experiments retained for their relevance to IAS impacts and control-outcome relationships.
- After screening, 373 publications were deemed relevant.
- Further screening collected data on title, authors, journal, year, taxa, type of control method, and whether outcomes were evaluated.

## Contents and data resources
- File: WOS-ControlSearchFinal.csv — a CSV containing results from the Web of Science search for "invasive species control efficacy."
- Each row represents a relevant study.
- Columns include:
  - Title
  - Authors
  - Journal
  - Year
  - Taxa (targeted by the control intervention)
  - Type (control method)
  - Outcomes - not including non-target & side effects (YES/NO)
  - Outcomes - including non-target & side effects (YES/NO)
- These outcome columns indicate whether the study evaluated the effectiveness of the control on IAS impacts and whether it assessed non-target and other side effects.
