# Bowl tipping bucket rain gauge

## Overview
- Documentation for the tipping bucket rain gauge RG3 at the bowl study site, Tyn-ybryn. It is a 0.2 mm tipping bucket gauge installed on 6 April 2005, located above ground.

## Key Facts
- Location: Bowl study area, Tyn-ybryn (above ground).
- Installation date: 6 April 2005.
- Identifier: RG3.
- Data status: Subject to multiple maintenance notes affecting data quality and interpretation.

## Data Quality, Provenance & Anomalies
- 02/06/05 — Data suspected: sheep damaged tiny tag; protective trench added.
- 06/12/05 — Gauge blocked and unblocked; readings should be treated with caution.
- 25/01/06 — Rebalanced using a spirit level on the base plate.
- 29/06/06 — Requires new cable.
- 04/07/06 (0925–0950 GMT) — Ignore tips; wiring issue with tiny tag.
- 05/07/06 — Tipping buckets calibrated; ignore tips between 13:30–14:30.
- 14/07/06 — Download checked; functioning after re-installation.
- 03/10/06 — Gauge had come off securing bolt; time slightly off; logger reset.
- Feb 2007 — Data dodgy due to snow and wind; snow may not have been recorded properly.
- 30/04/07 — Battery, seal, desiccant replaced.
- 19/02/08 — Pedestal collapse; wooden stand installed; possible frozen readings Feb 13–19.
- 08/05/08 — Base eroded; wooden stand in place; ignore tips during this period.
- 12/06/08 — Calibration-related tip disregard around rebalancing.
- 21/08/08 — Ignore tips during calibration check (approx. 15:03–15:18 GMT).
- 31/10/08 — Time stamp issue; data alignment adjusted post-download.
- 07/01/09 — Downloaded; gauge reported as frozen.
- 02/04/09 — Time stamp issue possibly due to GMT→BST change; accounted for in analysed data.

## Maintenance & Operational Actions
- Protective measures against livestock; structural stabilization (wooden stand); recalibration; battery, cable, seal replacements; time synchronization and metadata updates; data quality checks and anomaly annotations.

## Implications for Data Strategy (Data Leaders)
- Single-sensor data in harsh environments requires rigorous provenance and metadata to interpret data correctly.
- Frequent maintenance and environmental factors introduce time-stamp issues, calibration windows, and periods of questionable measurements.
- Essential to annotate anomalies, calibration periods, and periods affected by external factors (sheep interference, snow, erosion, potential freezing).

## Recommendations for Data Governance
- Maintain comprehensive, time-stamped maintenance logs and link to data provenance records.
- Clearly mark and flag data periods affected by maintenance, calibration, or environmental interference.
- Implement consistent time zone handling (GMT/BST) and verify time stamps across downloads.
- Consider hardware enhancements (animal protection, stable foundations) to reduce data gaps and anomalies.
- Ensure metadata captures measurement resolution, sensor status, and any operational exceptions to support downstream analysis and cross-network data comparisons.
