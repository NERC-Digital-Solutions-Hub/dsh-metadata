# Bowl tipping bucket rain gauge

- The tipping bucket rain gauge (0.2 mm) is located in the bowl study site at Tyn-ybryn, above ground level, and was installed on 6 April 2005. It was originally known as RG3.

- The accompanying log documents a series of data quality and maintenance events from 2005 to 2009, highlighting how field conditions and equipment issues can affect rainfall measurements and time stamps.

- Key data quality issues noted over time include:
  - 02/06/2005: Data suspected due to sheep accessing the gauge; tiny tag stolen; trench later dug to protect the site.
  - 06/12/2005: Gauge blocked and later unblocked; caution advised when interpreting prior readings.
  - 25/01/2006: Gauge rebalanced using a spirit level on the base plate.
  - 29/06/2006: Gauge required a new cable.
  - 04/07/2006 (09:25–09:50 GMT): Ignore tips during this period; wiring of tiny tag noted.
  - 05/07/2006: Tipping buckets calibrated; ignore tips between 13:30–14:30.
  - 14/07/2006: Rain gauge download checked; functioning after re-installation.
  - 03/10/2006: Gauge detached from securing bolts; time drift; logger reset.
  - Feb 2007: Data considered dodgy due to heavy snowfall and wind effects on readings.
  - 30/04/2007: Battery, seal, and desiccant changed on Tinytag.
  - 19/02/2008: Gauge appeared misaligned due to soil pedestal collapse; wooden stand recommended; possible frozen conditions mid-February.
  - 08/05/2008: Base eroded and lopsided; wooden stand installed; ignore tips during this period.
  - 12/06/2008: Calibration-related tip ignore period around 12:00 GMT noted.
  - 21/08/2008: Calibration check period with tips to be disregarded around 15:03–15:18 GMT.
  - 31/10/2008: Time stamp issues and overlap with previous download; time adjusted to follow on after last record.
  - 07/01/2009: Rain gauge data download reported as the bucket/tipping bucket (TB) frozen.
  - 02/04/2009: Time stamp issue likely due to GMT–BST shift; adjustments accounted for in the analysed data file.

- Maintenance actions and hardware updates described in the log include:
  - Physical protections implemented to deter sheep and soil pedestal stabilization (trench construction; wooden stand).
  - Periodic recalibration and rebalancing using spirit level; creation of new wiring connections; battery and sensor desiccant changes.
  - Reinstallation and verification of downloads after maintenance events; checks during calibration periods to ensure accurate readings.

- Time stamps and timekeeping considerations:
  - Numerous notes reference time stamps being off or adjusted (GMT vs BST, overlaps between downloads, and explicit instructions to ignore tips during calibration or rebalancing).
  - Some periods explicitly require data interpretation adjustments (e.g., post-rebalancing, during calibration checks, or when snow/frozen conditions affected logging).

- Implications for analysts monitoring environmental health and policy performance:
  - The dataset requires careful QA, with attention to periods of known data quality issues (animal interference, weather-related anomalies, protective structural changes, and timekeeping shifts).
  - Calibration, rebalancing, and maintenance events provide critical context for interpreting rainfall totals and patterns.
  - Time alignment across downloads may need explicit corrections to ensure consistent time series analyses, especially around GMT/BST transitions and post-maintenance downloads.
  - Physical vulnerabilities (above-ground placement, soil pedestal erosion, and animal access) can influence data continuity and should be considered when aggregating long-term trends.

- Overall takeaway for data use:
  - Use the log to identify and flag intervals of unreliable data.
  - Apply documented time corrections and calibration periods when constructing rainfall time series.
  - Consider maintenance and environmental factors as part of uncertainty assessment in environmental monitoring analyses.
