# Pontbren Database

## Overview
- Documentation of Equipment & Methods, borehole logs, N-probe manipulation plots, and streamflow data for the Pontbren study.
- Aims to support dataset discovery, governance, and reuse across multi-site environmental monitoring.
- Includes site-specific instrumentation details, sampling regimes, lithology logs, and site references to support provenance and interpretation.

## Data Content and Structure Highlights
- Borehole logs
  - Multiple NP boreholes (e.g., NP20, NP21, NP22, NP23) with detailed descriptions of soil stratigraphy, depths, and lithology.
  - Each log includes grid references, datum levels, depth measurements, thicknesses, and completion details (e.g., 16 gauge aluminum access tubing).
  - Descriptions cover soil types, mottling, moisture, gravel content, and presence of groundwater or stand-alone samples.
  - Source attribution to Centre for Ecology and Hydrology with dates (e.g., 14/05/06) and site context (e.g., LLANFAIR CAEREINION area; N-probe manipulation plots at Site S3).
- N-probe manipulation plots
  - Documentation for plots at Site S3 (east, central, and west/more westernmost locations) with associated borehole logs and grid references.
- Equipment & Methods
  - Recurrent mention of hand augers, AQ drill rods, guide tubes, pneumatic hammers, Atlas Copco and Leopard drills.
  - Borehole completions and sampling details (e.g., borehole log sheets, depth intervals, sampling depths).
- Streamflow and Appendix D
  - Appendix D provides streamflow gauging site data with flow metered estimates, start/finish times, and site identifiers.
  - Flow data span multiple sites and dates, including repeated measurements and time stamps.
  - Data points include measured flow values in historical units (e.g., litres per second) and temporal metadata.

## Data Quality, Metadata, and Documentation
- Borehole logs contain descriptive lithology, depth, and sampling details, enabling interpretation of subsurface conditions.
- Logs are standardized with fields such as grid reference, datum level, thickness, depth mBGL, completion details, and sample intervals.
- Site provenance documented (e.g., Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd; CEH).
- Dates are embedded in the logs, supporting temporal context and re-processing needs.
- Documentation emphasizes provenance, calibration references, and site-level context to support data reuse.

## Data Access, Formats, and Usability
- Data appear in narrative borehole log sheets and associated field sheets (e.g., BOREHOLE LOG sheets with descriptive text).
- Grid references (e.g., SJ 07360 06833) and datum levels are provided for geospatial alignment.
- Streamflow data are presented as time-stamped flow estimates, suitable for integration into hydrograph analyses.
- The dataset emphasizes traceability to instrumentation and site layouts, aiding interpretation and audit trails.

## Governance and Stewardship Considerations
- Clear attribution to CEH and collaborating drilling/monitoring providers supports accountability and provenance.
- Rich, site-specific metadata (instrumentation, deployment dates, depth ranges, and lithology) supports data discovery and quality assessment.
- Data may require ongoing quality control, reprocessing, and alignment with QA codes and metadata standards (as referenced in broader documentation).

## Particular Challenges
- Heterogeneous data formats across borehole logs, site sheets, and streamflow records.
- Ensuring consistent metadata across multiple sites and instruments.
- Integrating narrative borehole descriptions with quantitative measurements for machine readability.
- Managing legacy or scanned log content that may require digitization and standardization.

## Takeaways for Data Stewards
- Pontbren Database provides a comprehensive, well-documented framework for multi-site hydrogeological datasets, including:
  - Rich borehole logs with detailed lithology, depths, and completion data.
  - Site-specific instrument details and manipulation plots to support interpretation.
  - Time-stamped streamflow data across a network of gauging sites for hydrological analysis.
  - Strong provenance via documented affiliations (CEH and contractors) and site references.
- Governance actions to consider:
  - Preserve and continuously update metadata to maintain full provenance and interpretability.
  - Ensure data formats support interoperability (consider structuring logs into machine-readable formats alongside narrative logs).
  - Maintain clear mapping between site references, grid coordinates, and datum levels.
  - Plan for ongoing QA, calibration notes, and potential reprocessing as part of data updates.
  - Communicate any data limitations or uncertainties arising from legacy formats or incomplete standardization to users.
