# Equipment & Methods

- Overview
  - Document records drilling methods, borehole logs, and N-probe manipulation plots used by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd for site investigations in Llanfair Caereinion area.
  - Focuses on N-probe sites near Site S3 (Easternmost, Central, Westernmost) and related boreholes NP20–NP23.
  - Provides grid references, datum levels, and detailed borehole descriptions to support groundwater and soil investigations.

- Sites and positioning
  - N-probe/manipulation plots: Site S3 (Easternmost 3.1), Site S3 (Central 3.2), Site S3 (Westernmost 3.3).
  - Additional location: COED CWM-Y-LLWYNOG LLANFAIR CAEREINION (N-probe Tyn y Fron Trees, edge of wood).
  - Grid references include SJ 07360 06833, SJ 07341 06821, SJ 07323 06807, SJ 07426 06920, SJ 07426 06920 (examples).

- Equipment and drilling methods
  - Hand auger with AQ drill rod / guide tube.
  - Pneumatic hammer; Atlas Copco RAB hand-held air flush rotary drill.
  - Atlas Copco Leopard rotary/percussive air flush drill (in later logs).
  - Completion tubing: 16 gauge aluminum access tubing, diameter 44.5 mm.

- Borehole logging and format
  - Borehole logs presented as narratives per sheet, including:
    - Depth intervals (Thickness and Depth mBGL) and corresponding soil descriptions.
    - Ground level and datum level entries.
    - Soil/rock descriptions with color codes (e.g., Dark yellow brown silty clay; Soft - firm olive yellow clay; Stiff greyish brown clay; Gravel with sandstone/mudstone).
    - Notations on presence of water: "Water Not struck" at certain intervals.
    - Samples specified by depth ranges (e.g., 0.80–1.60 m).
    - Completion details for each borehole with aluminum tubing.
    - Dates documented (e.g., Date 14/05/06).
  - Example boreholes and logs
    - NP20: Easternmost (Site S3), grid SJ 07360 06833; logs show horizons from 0.25 m to beyond 1.60 m with varying silty/clay textures and multiple transitions.
    - NP21: Central (Site S3), grid SJ 07341 06821; similar multi-layer soil sequence with depths indicated (0.25 m, 0.60–1.50 m, up to 1.60 m) and completion tubing noted.
    - NP22: Westernmost (Site S3), grid SJ 07323 06807; detailed horizons including silty/clay transitions, moist/clay margins, gravelly components, and depth markers up to 1.55–1.60 m.
    - NP23: Location COED CWM-Y-LLWYNOG LLANFAIR CAEREINION; logs show humic soils at shallow depths (0.25–0.85 m) followed by stiff gravelly/clay horizons, with deeper horizons reaching ~1.5 m, and complex gravel/sandstone/mudstone textures.
  - Field documentation
    - Each sheet includes “Date 14/05/06” and references to BOREHOLE LOG, Datum level, Ground level, and Depth mBGL.
    - Additional notes on mineral composition: gravel types (sandstone, mudstone) and mottling colors (yellow/brown, grey).

- N-probe details and manipulation plots
  - N-probes associated with manipulation plots 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 at Site S3 in LLANFAIR CAEREINION.
  - Logs indicate specific site contexts (easternmost/central/westernmost) and integration with borehole logging for groundwater assessment.

- Data provenance and presentation
  - Documented by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd as part of a broader groundwater investigation.
  - Logs are presented in sheet form with detailed borehole characteristics, site coordinates, and completion details to support reproducibility and subsequent analysis.

- Notable observations and data considerations
  - Multiple horizons show transitions between silty/clayey textures, with occasional stiff or soft clay layers and gravelly components.
  - Some horizons indicate water not struck, while others imply potential groundwater-bearing intervals at shallow depths.
  - Depths are recorded as thickness and depth mBGL; several horizons reach depths around 1.0–1.6 m.
  - Consistent use of 16 gauge aluminum access tubing for borehole completions.
  - Dates and site-specific coordinates are essential for correlating with other Pontbren/LC datasets and for downstream hydrogeological modeling.
