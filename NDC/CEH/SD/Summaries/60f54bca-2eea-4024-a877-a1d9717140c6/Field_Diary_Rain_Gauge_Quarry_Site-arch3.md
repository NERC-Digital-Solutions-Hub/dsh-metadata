# Quarry Rain gauge

## Overview
- Information document for the rain gauges located at the Quarry at Tyn y Bryn Farm (originally RG2).
- Describes a 0.2 mm tipping bucket rain gauge at ground level and notes data from an adjacent storage gauge for comparison and quality assessment.

## Equipment and setup
- Instruments involved: tipping bucket rain gauge (TB), storage gauge, reed switch connected to a logger, tinytag sensor, leaf collector gauze.
- Data handling: data downloaded from the logger and used to compare TB vs storage gauge readings; some references to the RG2.xls dataset for details.
- Field maintenance items mentioned: battery, seals, desiccant, periodic cleaning, and calibration/leveling checks.

## Data issues and incidents (highlights)
- 31/03/05: Quarry pit flooded but TB mechanism unaffected.
- 24/06/05 & 06/11/05: TB funnel issues and tiny tag failures; replacements and cleaning performed.
- Feb 2006: storage gauge reading (92.5 mm) differed from TB reading (189.2 mm), raising data quality concerns.
- Feb 2006 – 03/2006: February data deemed dodgy; a test on 24/03/06 showed system behavior; some suspected short-circuit events observed during flooding tests.
- 02/08/06 – 03/10/06: data downloaded and cleaned; some timestamps off (logger offset by about 52 minutes); data continuity issues noted.
- 2007: multiple incidents of blocked TB, water ingress, and drainage problems (e.g., leaf collector issues, rusty connections, and a water-filled TB hole).
- 01/03/07: storage gauge recorded a large value (499 mm); leaf collector gauze lost; additional maintenance performed.
- 06/03/07 – 17/04/07: TB blockages and drainage problems identified; rust and potential short circuit suspected; repeated cleaning and drainage improvements implemented.
- 30/04/07 – 12/06/08: battery/seal/desiccant changes; rebalancing TB; attempts to improve drainage and reduce blockage frequency.
- 03/11/08 & 02/12/08: timestamp issues persisted; another blockage event reported with a note on irregularities between TB and storage gauge readings.
- 26/10/09: ongoing TB blockage concerns; data quality issues identified with pre-existing data prior to the latest collection period.

## Data quality and validation
- Recurrent discrepancies between TB and storage gauge readings, prompting cross-checks and verification efforts.
- Frequent blockages, flooding, and drainage problems leading to questionable measurements.
- Timestamp misalignments and occasional short-circuit indications affecting data integrity.
- Tests (e.g., on 24/03/06) used to validate system response, including manual counting of tips to verify sensor output.
- References to data quality concerns and the need to examine data in RG2.xls for details.

## Maintenance and corrective actions
- Replacements and repairs: tiny tag replacements, leaf collector gauze replacement, battery/seal/desiccant changes, and sensor cleaning.
- Structural and drainage improvements: improving drainage around the TB hole, spiking surrounding soil, and periodic cleaning of the TB hole.
- Calibration and alignment: rebalancing TB, addressing timestamp offsets, and ensuring accurate logging times.

## Data governance, metadata, and accessibility
- Data referenced from RG2.xls and associated logs; metadata quality issues noted (e.g., missing or misaligned timestamps, need for detailed provenance).
- Recurrent invitation to verify data against the adjacent storage gauge to assess reliability.
- Implicit governance challenges include data sharing and transparent reporting of data quality and modifications due to field issues.

## Implications for monitoring practice
- Field rainfall monitoring can be compromised by equipment faults, environmental factors (flooding, snow), and maintenance lapses.
- Importance of cross-validation between primary sensors and reference gauges, robust QA/QC procedures, and comprehensive metadata.
- Necessity for timely maintenance, clear documentation of incidents, and transparent data handling to support reliable environmental health assessments.
