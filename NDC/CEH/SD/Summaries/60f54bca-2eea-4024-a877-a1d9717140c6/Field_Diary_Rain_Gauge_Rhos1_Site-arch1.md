# Rhos 1 Rain gauge read me document

## Overview
- Logs maintenance, calibration, and data quality notes for the Rhos1 rain gauge from 2006 to 2008.
- Tracks timing issues, physical repairs, calibration checks, and data adjustments.

## Chronology of maintenance and events
- 03/10/06: Gauge blocked; 21 mm collected from storage cylinder. Aperture differences mean this reading may be incorrect. Last sample time ( laptop time vs. data time) differed by ~69 minutes; logger reset. Gauge removed and taken to Bangor as unblocking in the field was not possible.
- 12/10/06: Gauge rebalanced with spirit level; ~09:20 Rain gauge reinstalled.
- Feb 2007: Gauge rebalanced; data deemed dodgy due to significant snowfall and wind blowing snow off the gauge, compromising recording.
- 01/05/07: Rebalanced; battery, seal, and desiccant replaced in Tinytag.
- 01/04/08: Rebalanced; after downloading Tinytag, a wire detached from the reed switch connector.
- 02/04/08: Rebalanced; replaced cable linking reed switch to Tinytag; system functioning again.
- 21/08/08: Rebalanced; disregard tips between ~14:25–14:44 GMT due to calibration check being performed at that time.
- 03/11/08: Determined last month’s data was 5 minutes fast; data adjusted in the Excel document accordingly.

## Data quality and interpretation notes
- Data quality affected by physical blockages, maintenance events, and timing issues (time drift).
- Reading during 03/10/06 may be unreliable due to aperture differences between gauges and the logger time lag.
- Snowfall and wind events (Feb 2007) likely caused under-recording or missing data.
- Calibration checks and repairs (Aug 2008) introduced temporary data considerations (certain tips excluded).
- Time accuracy adjustments applied to past data (e.g., 03/11/08 note and Excel adjustments).

## Hardware and data handling
- Tinytag data logistics (battery, seals, desiccant; wiring to reed switch; occasional connector issues) affected data continuity.
- Data corrections are documented and applied in an Excel dataset to align timestamps and measurements.
- Overall emphasis on documenting maintenance actions to support data interpretation and future reproducibility.
