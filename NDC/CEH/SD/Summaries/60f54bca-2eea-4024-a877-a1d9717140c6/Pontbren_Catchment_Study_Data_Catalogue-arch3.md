# Introduction to the Database Catalogue

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the Pontbren Database to enable monitoring for environmental health policy scrutiny and future decision-making.
  - Covers multiple study sites and data streams (weather, runoff, soil water tension, groundwater, streamflow, rain gauges, neutron probe moisture, and land-use manipulation experiments), plus field notes and QA logs.

- Data organization and framework
  - Data files organized into directories following a defined framework; quality-assured data points carry QA codes.
  - Most data stored as .txt files, typically in 6-month blocks; file names indicate collection dates.
  - Appendices provide supplementary metadata and QA guidance; field diaries capture data issues and site-specific notes.

- Data content by theme
  - Automatic Weather Station (AWS)
    - Bowl site location; sensors sample every 1 minute; outputs include daily and 10-minute averages.
    - Variables: incident radiation, wind, temperatures, humidity, net radiation; sensor changes prompted 2009 data structure update.
  - Bowl study site runoff and soil water tension
    - Weir boxes and tipping buckets for bowl runoff; tensiometers at multiple depths; logger management changes noted post-2008.
  - Groundwater
    - Five boreholes with Diver transducers and barometric compensation; outputs as water height and temperature; sampling frequency evolved from 10-minute to 30-minute.
  - Hillslope study site runoff and soil water tension
    - Tree shelterbelt data; overland flow and drain measurements; tensiometer arrays; logger updates after 2008.
  - Llyn Hir study site soil water tension
    - Tensiometer arrays; frequency adjusted to reduce site visits; moisture tension in cm H2O.
  - Land use manipulation plots
    - Four sites with three plots each (Grazed, Ungrazed, Trees); tensiometers and overland flow plots; data in cm H2O and mm/h.
  - Neutron probe soil moisture
    - Multi-site measurements from bowl, hillslope, plots, tree areas, Llyn Hir; depth profiles ~10–120 cm with site-specific calibration.
  - Rain gauge data
    - Tipping bucket and storage gauges at multiple locations; units in mm/day or mm; varied elevations.
  - Field diaries
    - Documents field observations and instrumentation issues.
  - Streamflow
    - Starflow at sites 1–9 and 13; other sites with transducers and v-notch weirs; outputs include stage, velocity, depth, temperature, flow; site-specific calibration notes; low-flow data excluded from calibration.

- Quality assurance and metadata
  - Appendix A: QA coding system for data quality across streams (tensiometers, rain gauges, tipping buckets, AWS, etc.).
  - Appendices B–D: Borehole, neutron probe logs, and field-methods documentation with equipment details, procedures, and context.
  - Emphasis on metadata that supports verification, reuse, and data lineage (methods, sampling frequencies, gaps, maintenance, transformations).

- Data governance, access, and limitations
  - Data quality, openness, and source-level data management are core principles; public sharing is encouraged but can be a barrier for some datasets.
  - Acknowledges data gaps and quality issues (e.g., equipment downtime, site-specific problems, evaporation effects, gaps in metadata).
  - Framework supports transparency about data lineage, sensor configurations, calibration approaches, and site-specific notes; aims to reduce silos and improve cross-site data use.

- Appendices and supporting information
  - Appendix A: Detailed QA coding for multiple data streams and field notes.
  - Appendix B–D: Borehole, neutron probe, and related site logs and descriptions (grid refs, depths, lithology, completions).

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a comprehensive, multi-site, multi-method data framework suitable for policy-relevant environmental health evaluation.
  - Strengths: extensive instrumentation, standardized QA codes, site-specific calibration approaches.
  - Policy-facing considerations: ensure metadata sufficiency, address data gaps and access barriers, mitigate data silos, and maintain transparent data governance and sharing practices.

- Equipment & Methods (illustrative excerpt from Appendix content)
  - Field instrumentation and borehole work: hand augers, AQ drill rods, pneumatic hammer, rotary drills; CEH-authored borehole logs; detailed site references, grid coordinates, datum levels, soil descriptions, depths, and completion details.
  - Representative site entries show multiple boreholes (NP20–NP23) with standardized recording of soil layers, depths, sampling intervals, and protective casing details.
  - Documents ongoing collaboration with Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd and CEH; notes on dates, datum, and descriptive metadata to support data provenance and reproducibility.
