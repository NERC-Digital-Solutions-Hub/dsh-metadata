# Bowl tipping bucket rain gauge

## Overview
- Tipping bucket rain gauge located at the bowl study site, originally known as RG3.
- 0.2 mm tipping bucket rain gauge, located in the bowl study area at Tyn-ybryn; mounted above ground.
- Installed on 6 April 2005.

## Data collection and maintenance history
- 02/06/05: Data considered suspect after sheep damaged the tiny tag; trench dug to protect from sheep.
- 06/12/05: Rain gauge blocked, subsequently unblocked.
- 25/01/06: Gauge rebalanced using a spirit level on the base plate.
- 29/06/06: Rain gauge required a new cable.
- 04/07/06: Ignore tips between 09:25 and 09:50 GMT due to wiring in a tiny tag.
- 05/07/06: Tipping buckets calibrated; ignore tips between 13:30 and 14:30.
- 14/07/06: Gauge download checked; functioning after reinstallation.
- 03/10/06: Gauge had come off a securing bolt and became unbalanced; time slightly out; logger reset.
- Feb 2007: Data dodgy due to significant snowfall; wind likely blew snow off the gauge, affecting recording.
- 30/04/07: Battery, seal, and desiccant replaced.
- 19/02/08: Pedestal collapsed; wooden stand installed; possible frozen conditions between 13–19 Feb.
- 08/05/08: Base eroded; wooden stand installed; ignore tips at this time (pending stability).
- 12/06/08: Ignore tip around 1200 GMT during rebalancing.
- 21/08/08: Disregard tips between 15:03 and 15:18 GMT due to calibration activity.
- 31/10/08: Time stamp issue suspected with an overlap; assumed to follow immediately after the last record from previous download.
- 07/01/09: Data downloaded; tipping bucket frozen.
- 02/04/09: Time stamp issue possibly due to GMT to BST change; accounted for in analysed data file.

## Data quality issues encountered
- Data suspected or compromised by external interference (sheep access, weather conditions, snow, freezing).
- Sensor and hardware issues: blocked/unblocked gauge, worn cables, securing bolts loosening, battery/seal/desiccant degradation.
- Timekeeping and synchronization problems: time stamp misalignments, GMT/BST transitions, occasional overlaps.
- Structural and environmental challenges: pedestal collapse, base erosion, soil movement affecting leveling.
- Calibration and data integrity: periods marked for calibration, tips ignored during calibration or rebalancing.

## Mitigation and actions taken
- Physical protections implemented (trench to deter sheep; wooden stand after pedestal issues).
- Regular maintenance: rebalancing, calibration, cable replacement, battery/seal/desiccant changes.
- Data handling practices: marking and ignoring data during calibration windows; adjusting timestamps where necessary.
- Documentation of issues and events to support data cleaning and quality assurance.
- Post-event reviews to ensure continuity of data collection and to flag questionable periods for downstream analysis.

## Metadata, governance, and monitoring framework implications
- The entry highlights the importance of detailed maintenance logs and calibration records for data usability.
- Time-stamp consistency and timezone transitions (GMT/BST) require explicit metadata and adjustments in analyses.
- Environmental and structural vulnerabilities must be documented to interpret data gaps accurately.
- Data governance needs to support transparent data repair, exclusion rules during calibration, and clear notation of sensor health and installation changes.
- Sharing of underlying data and clear communication of data quality issues are essential for external scrutiny and policy-relevant interpretation.
