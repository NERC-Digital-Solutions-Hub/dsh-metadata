# Rhos 1 Rain gauge read me document

## Overview
- A maintenance and data integrity log for the Rhos 1 rain gauge (2006–2008).
- Focuses on field rebalancing, equipment issues, timekeeping drift, and data adjustments to support consistent environmental monitoring.

## Chronology of events
- 03/10/06: Gauge rebalanced with spirit level; Rhos1 gauge blocked. 21 mm collected from funnel; aperture difference means stored volume not directly comparable. Last sample time 16:10 GMT; laptop time 17:19 GMT; logger ~69 minutes behind; logger reset. Gauge removed to Bangor as unblocking in field was not possible.
- 12/10/06: Gauge rebalanced (~09:20) and reinstalled.
- Feb 2007: Rebalanced; data considered dodgy due to snow and wind blowing snow off the gauge.
- 01/05/07: Rebalanced; battery, seal, and desiccant on Tinytag replaced.
- 01/04/08: Rebalanced; Tinytag wiring issue where wire detached from connector to reed switch.
- 02/04/08: Rebalanced; replaced cable between reed switch and Tinytag; reconnected and working.
- 21/08/08: Rebalanced; tips between ~14:25–14:44 GMT disregarded due to calibration check occurring at that time.
- 03/11/08: Rebalanced; last month’s data deemed 5 minutes fast; corrections applied in the Excel dataset.

## Data quality, calibration, and timekeeping
- Time drift: initial ~69-minute lag corrected by logger reset.
- Measurement differences: gauge aperture mismatch affects comparability with storage gauge.
- Snow/wind effects: snowfall not reliably recorded during windy periods.
- Calibration checks led to adjustments (e.g., 14:25–14:44 GMT period and monthly data correction of 5 minutes).
- Corrections tracked in an Excel document.

## Equipment and maintenance actions
- Regular rebalancing with a spirit level on the base plate.
- Tinytag maintenance: battery, seal, and desiccant replacement; wiring repairs to connect Tinytag with reed switch.
- Field limitations: some issues could not be resolved in the field (gauge removal for repair noted).

## Data accessibility and use
- Field maintenance notes and corrections are documented to support transparency and traceability.
- Data adjustments (time and calibration) are recorded in accompanying spreadsheets, highlighting the need for accessible metadata for downstream analysis.

## Implications for monitoring
- Ensures continued data usability by addressing drift, calibration checks, and equipment faults.
- Highlights the importance of consistent timekeeping, calibration practices, and documenting corrections to enable long-term environmental assessments.
