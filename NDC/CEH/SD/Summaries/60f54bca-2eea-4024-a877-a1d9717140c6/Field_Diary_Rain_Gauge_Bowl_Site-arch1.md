# Bowl tipping bucket rain gauge

- Overview
  - 0.2 mm tipping bucket rain gauge located in the bowl study area at Tyn-ybryn; gauge is above ground level.
  - Installed on 6 April 2005.

- Data quality issues and anomalies
  - 02/06/05: data suspected due to sheep access; tiny tag bitten off; trench dug to protect gauge.
  - 06/12/05: gauge blocked then unblocked; prior readings should be treated with caution.
  - 25/01/06: rebalanced using a spirit level on the base plate.
  - 29/06/06: rain gauge requires a new cable.
  - 04/07/06: ignore tips between 09:25 and 09:50 GMT due to wiring involving a tiny tag.
  - 05/07/06: tipping buckets calibrated; ignore tips between 13:30 and 14:30 GMT.
  - 14/07/06: rain gauge download checked; functioning after re-installation.
  - 03/10/06: gauge had come off a securing bolt; time slightly out; logger reset.
  - Feb 2007: data dodgy due to substantial snow; wind likely blew snow off gauge.
  - 30/04/07: battery, seal, and desiccant on tinytag replaced.
  - 19/02/08: pedestal collapsed; wooden support installed; possible freezing issues Feb 13–19.
  - 08/05/08: base more eroded; wooden stand installed; ignore tips during this period.
  - 12/06/08: ignore tips around 12:00 GMT during rebalancing.
  - 21/08/08: ignore tips between 15:03 and 15:18 GMT due to calibration check.
  - 31/10/08: time stamp issue with overlap between downloads; time adjusted to follow immediately after previous record.
  - 07/01/09: bowl RG3 data noted as frozen in download.
  - 02/04/09: time stamp issue likely due to GMT–BST change; accounted for in analysed data file.

- Maintenance and interventions
  - Protective measures against wildlife (sheep) and reinforcement of mounting hardware (wooden stand) after structural issues.
  - Regular calibrations and rebalancing to maintain measurement accuracy.
  - Routine battery, seal, and desiccant replacements for the tinytag data logger.
  - Time synchronization and documentation of GMT/BST transitions and any resulting timestamp adjustments.

- Time stamps and data corrections
  - Recurrent issues with time stamps (overlaps, GMT/BST transitions, and occasional misalignment) corrected in the analysed dataset.
  - Some readings intentionally ignored during calibration, rebalancing, or known hardware issues.
  - Data downloads sometimes indicate freezing or data gaps; corrective notes recorded to inform subsequent analyses.

- Implications for data use
  - The dataset contains multiple quality flags and periods of suspect or ignored data.
  - Users should reference maintenance logs and timestamp correction notes when interpreting readings.
  - Periods of structural issues, snow events, and calibration checks contribute to gaps or altered readings; careful filtering and metadata checks are essential for analysis.
