# Penllwyn Rain gauge read me document

## Overview
- A maintenance and data quality log for the Penllwyn rain gauge and Tinytag system, documenting installation, recalibrations, anomalies, and adjustments to ensure data reliability.

## Timeline of key events
- 25/01/06: Rain gauge installed.
- 03/10/06: Last reading mismatch (Pen RG 1349 vs laptop 1441 GMT); approximately 52 minutes out; reset performed.
- Feb/07: Data considered dodgy due to heavy snow; wind-blown snow likely not recorded properly.
- 30/04/07: Battery, seal, and desiccant on Tinytag replaced.
- 31/10/07: Wind displaced tipping bucket (11:20).
- 30/11/07: Wind displaced tipping bucket again (10:36); some water present in the system.
- 22/12/07: ~8 hours of impossibly high readings; cold conditions suspected as a contributing factor; bowl weirboxes also had a problem at this time.
- 03/11/07: Time stamp issue and potential overlap with previous download; time adjusted to follow on after last record from the previous download; adjustment reflected in the Excel file.

## Data quality issues identified
- Timestamp discrepancies and misalignment between instrument readings and download times.
- Weather conditions (wind, snow, cold) causing anomalous readings or data loss.
- Physical instrument issues: tipping bucket displacement, water presence in the system, and bowl weirbox problems.
- Periods of readings that appear unrealistically high or out of expected range.

## Maintenance actions and corrections
- Hardware maintenance: battery, seal, and desiccant replacement on Tinytag (30/04/07); other periodic checks implied by notes of wind-induced issues.
- Data corrections: time stamp adjustments to maintain sequential continuity; corrections implemented in the Excel dataset to align with actual times.

## Data handling and implications for monitoring
- The log underscores the importance of documenting both data anomalies and corrective actions to maintain a trustworthy dataset.
- Clear notes on when and why timestamps were adjusted help preserve auditability for standardised environmental monitoring outputs.
- Highlights need to consider sensor reliability and environmental conditions when interpreting monitored data, and to ensure raw data and processed outputs remain traceable for policy scrutiny and data sharing.
