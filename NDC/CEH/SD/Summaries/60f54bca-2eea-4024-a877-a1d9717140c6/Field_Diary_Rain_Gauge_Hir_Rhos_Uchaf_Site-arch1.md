# Hirrhos Uchaf tipping bucket and storage rain gauge

## Installation details
- Tipping bucket (T/B) installed 07/11/06
- Storage gauge installed 09:30 GMT 08/11/06

## Data quality issues
- Feb/07: Data dodgy due to a significant amount of snow; wind blew snow off the rain gauge, leading to under-recording.
- 03/11/08: Timestamp issue and overlap with the previous download; time adjusted to follow immediately after the last record from the previous download.
- 06/04/09: Timestamp issue possibly from the change from GMT to BST; accounted for in the analysed data file.
- May/09: Only have data from 26th to 27th; reason uncertain.

## Data handling and availability
- Adjustments: Time stamps adjusted and accounted for in the analysed data file.
- Data gaps: Notable periods with questionable or missing data (e.g., Feb 2007, May 2009 partial coverage). 

## Implications for analysis
- Data quality varies across periods; need to account for timestamp adjustments and potential under-recording.
- Ensure consistent time reference (GMT/BST) and document any data exclusions or caveats when analysing trends.
