# Hirrhos Uchaf tipping bucket and storage rain gauge

## Overview
- Site and instruments: tipping bucket rain gauge (T/B) and storage rain gauge at Hirrhos Uchaf
- Installations: T/B installed 07/11/06; storage gauge installed 09:30 GMT 08/11/06

## Data quality and issues
- Feb 2007: data dodgy due to significant snow; wind-blown snow off rain gauge likely caused under-recording
- 03 Nov 2008: time stamp issue with overlap from previous download; time adjusted to follow immediately after the last record
- 06 Apr 2009: time stamp issue possibly due to GMT to BST change; accounted for in the analysed data file
- May 2009: data available only from 26–27 May; reason not known

## Data handling (analyst perspective)
- Data verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation performed
- Analysed using standardised methods; time-stamp corrections incorporated into the analysed data file

## Notes for interpretation
- Data gaps and timestamp adjustments highlight the importance of QA and consistent timekeeping in environmental monitoring
- Coverage during May 2009 is incomplete, affecting longitudinal analyses for that period
