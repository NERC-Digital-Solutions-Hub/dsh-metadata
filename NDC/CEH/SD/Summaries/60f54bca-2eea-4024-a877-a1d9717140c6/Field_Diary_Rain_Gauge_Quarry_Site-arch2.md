# Quarry Rain gauge

## Overview
- Documentation of the rain gauges located at Quarry at Tyn y Bryn Farm (RG2), a 0.2 mm tipping bucket rain gauge at ground level.
- Purpose: monitor rainfall and support environmental monitoring datasets; data historically used with an adjacent storage gauge for cross-checks.
- The log records frequent maintenance, data quality concerns, and system checks across multiple years.

## Data Quality Issues and Incidents
- 31/03/05: Flooding in the pit did not appear to affect the tipping bucket mechanism.
- 24/06/05: Collection funnel full of water due to blockage.
- 05/11/05 – 30/11/05: Tiny tag failed and was replaced.
- 25/01/06: TB gauge rebalanced using a spirit level.
- Feb 2006: Storage gauge reading 92.5 mm while TB reading 189.2 mm; data quality questioned.
- 27/03/06 – 24/03/06: Tests conducted to assess system; February/March data deemed dodgy; evidence of possible short-circuiting when the pit was flooded.
- 04/05/06 – 02/08/06: Reports of questionable results; data downloaded, cleaned; storage gauge around 37.5 mm.
- 03/10/06: Last record timestamp drifted ~52 minutes; TB funnel cleaned.
- Feb 2007: Snow caused data issues; data deemed dodgy.
- 01/03/07: Storage gauge read 499 mm; leaf collector gauze lost.
- 06/03/07: TB blocked and full of water; measurement 1280 ml with some spillage; leaf collector replaced; potential short-circuit risk noted due to water near the tiny tag connection; drainage concerns raised.
- 03/04/07 – 12/04/07: Large discrepancy between TB and storage gauge; rusty TB–tinytag connection suspected; submersion concerns; drainage improvements recommended (drainage channel).
- 17/04/07 – 30/04/07: TB hole cleaned; TB system drainage improved; battery, seal, and desiccant replaced on tinytag.
- 29/01/08 – 01/04/08: Recurrent TB blockages due to wind-blown debris/soil; multiple cleanings and wind-related blockage notes; 12/06/08: TB rebalanced; surrounding soil spiked to improve drainage.
- 03/11/08 – 02/12/08: Timestamp issues and TB blockage noted; storage gauge still used as cross-check.
- 26/10/09: TB blocked around 16:40; storage gauge indicated ~4.5 mm; ongoing data quality concerns acknowledged.

## Maintenance Actions and System Changes
- Regular cleaning and rebalancing of the tipping bucket (TB) gauge and associated storage gauge.
- Replacement of faulty components: tiny tag, leaf collector gauze, battery, seal, desiccant.
- Electrical/logger checks and timestamp reconciliation; occasional lag corrections.
- Physical interventions to improve drainage: drainage channel digging and soil spiking around the TB housing.
- Consistent cross-checks between TB readings and adjacent storage gauge; attempts to validate data during periods of suspected inaccuracy.

## Data Consistency, Gaps, and Interpretation
- Recurrent discrepancies between tipping bucket readings and storage gauge values indicate intermittent data reliability.
- Timestamp drift and data blocks (due to floods, blockages, or short circuits) create gaps and require verification against physical maintenance notes and tests.
- Data were sometimes “dodgy” or questionable (notably Feb 2006, Feb 2007, Mar/Apr 2007, and late 2009), necessitating cleaning, recalibration, and cross-validation with stored reference measurements (storage gauge).
- Reports reference a data file (RG2.xls) for detail on questionable months, underscoring the need for careful QA before inclusion in longitudinal environmental datasets.

## Implications for Monitoring and Archiving
- The Quarry RG2 dataset demonstrates the importance of robust QA, cross-validation with storage gauges, and documentation of maintenance actions to ensure comparable, longitudinal rainfall records.
- To maximize data value, combine TB-derived rainfall with independent measurements (e.g., storage gauge) and maintain clear notes on data quality flags.
- Ensure datasets and logs are stored in accessible portals, with clear links between maintenance events, calibration actions, and data quality outcomes.
