# Hirrhos Uchaf tipping bucket and storage rain gauge

## Overview
- Tipping bucket (T/B) installed 07/11/06
- Storage gauge installed 08/11/06 at 09:30 GMT

## Data quality issues and adjustments
- Feb/2007: Data dodgy due to significant snow; wind-blown snow off the rain gauge not recorded properly.
- 03/11/2008: Time stamp issue with overlap from the previous download; the time is adjusted to follow immediately after the last record from the previous download.
- 06/04/2009: Time stamp issue possibly due to the change from GMT to BST; this is accounted for in the analysed data file.

## Data coverage
- May/2009: Only have data from 26th to 27th; reason unknown.

## Implications for analysis
- Periods affected by snow impact, and timestamp issues introduce potential inaccuracies and discontinuities.
- Need for careful metadata annotation and alignment across downloads.

## Recommendations for data users
- Treat data from Feb/2007 and May/2009 with caution; verify with ancillary sources if possible.
- Ensure any analyses account for timestamp corrections (GMT/BST transitions) and overlapping download adjustments.
- Document and communicate data quality flags or notes when using or sharing these data.
