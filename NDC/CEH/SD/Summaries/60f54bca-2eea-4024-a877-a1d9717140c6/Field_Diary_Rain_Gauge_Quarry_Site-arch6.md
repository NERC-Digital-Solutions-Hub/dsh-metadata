# Quarry Rain gauge

## Overview
- Information and maintenance log for the Quarry rain gauge RG2 at Tyn y Bryn Farm.
- 0.2 mm tipping bucket rain gauge located at ground level.
- Document covers observations, issues, maintenance actions, and data quality notes from 2005 to 2009.

## Data quality and issues observed
- 31/03/05: Pit flooded, but tipping bucket mechanism unaffected; water bailed out.
- 24/06/05: Storage funnel full of water due to blockage.
- 05/11/05: Tiny tag failed; replaced with new tiny tag on 30/11/05.
- Feb 2006: Storage gauge recorded 92.5 mm vs tipping bucket 189.2 mm; data quality questioned for Feb 2006.
- Feb 2006: February data deemed dodgy; further test initiated.
- 24/03/06: Test due to dodgy February data; potential short-circuit observed when pit flooded; three tips recorded during flooding despite no tips occurring.
- 04/05/06: Additional questionable results; investigation recommended.
- 02/08/06: Data downloaded and cleaned; adjacent storage gauge read 37.5 mm around 0950 GMT.
- 03/10/06: Last TB record read 1000 GMT but logger time offset by ~52 minutes; TB funnel cleaned; timestamp issues noted.
- Feb 2007: Significant snowfall causing dodgy data.
- 01/03/07: Storage gauge read 499 mm; TB gauge blocked and full of water; leaf collector gauze from TB gauge lost; new leaf collector attached; connection between TB and tiny tag suspected of short-circuit due to water.
- 03/04/07: Large discrepancy between TB and storage gauges; rusty reed switch connection identified; possible drainage issue; consideration of digging a drainage channel.
- 12/04/07: Visual signs of TB system problems after analysis.
- 17/04/07: TB hole cleaned to improve drainage.
- 30/04/07: Battery, seal, and desiccant replaced.
- 29/01/08: TB gauge blocked; blockage cleared.
- 01/04/08: TB gauge blocked by soil; partial flooding suspected due to windy conditions.
- 12/06/08: TB RG rebalanced; taken steps to improve accuracy.
- 03/11/08: Timestamp problem reappears; potential data misalignment.
- 02/12/08: Rain gauge blocked again; data quality affected.
- 26/10/09: TB gauge blocked; ongoing concerns about data reliability and completeness.

## Maintenance actions and calibrations
- Regular cleaning and rebalancing of the tipping bucket gauge.
- Replacing failed components (tiny tag; battery; seal; desiccant).
- Drainage improvements: cleaning pit, spiking surrounding soil to enhance drainage, creating drainage channels where needed.
- Leaf collector management: replacement when losses occurred.
- Cross-checks with adjacent storage gauge to assess data consistency.
- Timestamp/alignment checks and attempts to correct logging discrepancies.

## Implications for data use
- Data quality is intermittently compromised by:
  - Blockages in the TB funnel and storage gauge readouts.
  - Flooding and submersion causing short circuits or misreads.
  - Timestamp drift and logger synchronization issues.
  - Snow and wind-related data gaps or inaccuracies.
- Routine cross-validation with storage gauge is essential to identify suspect periods.
- Historical data prior to maintenance actions should be treated with caution; significant discrepancies often align with maintenance or drainage issues.
- Ongoing QA and proactive maintenance are required to improve long-term data reliability and reusability.
