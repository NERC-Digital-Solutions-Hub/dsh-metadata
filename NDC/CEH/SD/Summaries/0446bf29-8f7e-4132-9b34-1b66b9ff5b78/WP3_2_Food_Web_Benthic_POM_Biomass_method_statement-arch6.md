# Benthic particulate organic matter biomass

## Overview
- Records ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of three distinct size fractions of organic matter: >1 cm (woody debris), >1 mm (coarse particulate), and >0.025 mm (fine particulate).
- Data are presented as means with standard deviations.

## Study sites and timeframe
- Collected at three chalkstream sites in the Wessex chalk area: Nine Mile River, River Till, and River Wylye.
- Sites chosen to reflect a gradient of landscape integrity and river invertebrate diversity.
- Sampling occasions: Wylye and Nine Mile River (7 occasions total); Till (5 occasions).
- Data collection period: October 2012 to October 2013.

## Sampling design and data collection
- Up to 10 Surber samples per site per occasion (0.25 x 0.25 m; mesh 0.025 mm).
- In the lab, after removing invertebrates, retained fractions: coarse woody debris (>1 cm), coarse particulate (>1 mm), and fine particulate (>0.250 mm).
- Fractions dried and ashed to derive AFDM mass.
- Processing steps: samples dried at 80°C for at least 24 hours, weighed (to 0.0001 g), incinerated at 560°C for 8–12 hours, weighed again.

## Purpose and data use
- Used to construct quantified food webs detailing flux of mass and nutrients between nodes.
- Quantified standing stocks of benthic detritus resources.
- Outputs suitable for creation of self-serve data products (dashboards, pivot tables) and for reporting/visualization; outputs may be promoted and iterated based on feedback.

## Data structure and variables
- Columns include: RIVER_ID, SITE_ID, RIVER_NAME, SITE_NAME, NGR, EASTING, NORTHING, SAMPLE_DATE, POM_Fraction, Mean_AFDM_mgperm2, SD_AFDM_mgperm2, AFDM_n.

## Data quality and completeness
- Standard laboratory procedures followed for AFDM content.
- No formal QA procedure (e.g., repeat analysis of replicates) reported; final values checked for outliers (none found).
- Sampling gap note: River Till not sampled during salmonid breeding season (Dec–Mar) to avoid redd disturbance.
- Replicate counts: 10 replicates processed for Oct 2012, Feb 2013, Mar 2013, and May 2013; 5 replicates for Jul 2013, Aug 2013, and Oct 2013.

## Provenance and responsibility
- Collected, processed, interpreted, and managed by Queen Mary University of London River Communities Group.
- Lead researcher: Dr J. Iwan Jones.

## Accessibility and notes
- Data are summarized as means with associated standard deviations for each fraction.
- Temporal and spatial scope limited to three sites within the specified period; detailed methodology and variable definitions provided for reuse and integration with other datasets.
