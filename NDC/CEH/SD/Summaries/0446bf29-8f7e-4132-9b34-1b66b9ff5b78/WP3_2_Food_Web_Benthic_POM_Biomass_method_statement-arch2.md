# Benthic particulate organic matter biomass

- What it measures: ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of three benthic organic matter size fractions collected from Surber samples: woody debris (>1 cm), coarse particulate (>1 mm), and fine particulate (>0.250 mm). Data are presented as means with standard deviation.

- Data form: up to 10 replicate samples per site per sampling occasion; values provided as Mean_AFDM_mgperm2 and SD_AFDM_mgperm2, with AFDM_n denoting the number of samples.

- Study sites and temporal coverage:
  - Three chalkstream sites in the Wessex chalk area: Nine Mile River, River Till, and River Wylye.
  - Data collection spanned October 2012 to October 2013.
  - Wylye and Nine Mile River: seven sampling occasions; Till: five occasions.
  - Sampling avoided the salmonid breeding season (Dec–Mar) to prevent disturbance.

- Sampling methods:
  - Up to 10 Surber samples per site per occasion (0.25 x 0.25 m, mesh 0.025 mm) across a 100 m reach.
  - In the lab, after removing invertebrates, fractions retained: >1 cm woody debris, >1 mm coarse particulate, >0.250 mm fine particulate.
  - Fractions dried, weighed, then ashed to determine AFDM.

- Laboratory process:
  - Drying at 80°C for at least 24 hours; weighing (to 0.0001 g).
  - Incineration at 560°C for 8–12 hours; final weighing.

- Purpose and use:
  - Part of a broader effort to construct quantified food webs and detail mass and nutrient fluxes between nodes.
  - Aimed to quantify standing stocks of benthic detritus resources across sites reflecting landscape integrity and invertebrate diversity.

- Data producers and governance:
  - Collected and interpreted by the Queen Mary University of London River Communities Group, led by Dr J. Iwan Jones.

- Completeness and quality notes:
  - Five replicate samples for some dates (Jul, Aug, Oct 2013); ten replicates for other dates (Oct 2012, Feb 2013, Mar 2013, May 2013).
  - No sampling during salmonid redds; no formal QA procedure like intra-replicate repeats, but final values checked for outliers (none found).

- Data structure and fields:
  - RIVER_ID, SITE_ID, RIVER_NAME, SITE_NAME, NGR, EASTING, NORTHING, SAMPLE_DATE, POM_Fraction, Mean_AFDM_mgperm2, SD_AFDM_mgperm2, AFDM_n.
