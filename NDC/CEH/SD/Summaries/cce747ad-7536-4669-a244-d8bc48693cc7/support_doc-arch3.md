# Multivariate Life-history phenotype of 56 Daphnia magna clones reared in four different environments (Factorial cross of temperature x food)

## Overview
- A study of additive genetic variation and plasticity across environmental conditions using 56 Daphnia magna clones from the UK, France, and Denmark.
- Factorial experimental design crossing two temperatures and two food levels to assess genotype-by-environment interactions and multivariate life-history traits.

## Experimental design and study population
- Clones: 56 total (43 UK, 5 French, 8 Danish).
- Origin: Brown Moss (UK), Camargue (France), Lake Ring (Denmark).
- Preparation: resting eggs collected and stored; controlled hatching and stock cultures maintained at 21°C ± 1°C with 14:10 light:dark cycle.
- Maternal effects: three females per clone isolated and reared to produce a clutch; one offspring per clutch was reared for two generations to reduce maternal effects.
- Treatments: 2x2 factorial crossing of temperature (24°C and 18°C) and food levels (2x10^5 and 0.4x10^5 C. vulgaris cells ml^-1).
- Replication and blocks: 3–8 second-clutch neonates per clone allocated to treatments; experiments conducted in 5 temporal blocks (Jan 2017–Mar 2018) with clones assayed in multiple blocks.

## Treatments and rearing protocol
- Housing: 200 ml jars with 150 ml artificial pond water (ASTM) plus organic extracts; high-ration feeding thrice weekly; media refreshed biweekly.
- Treatment assignment: individual rearing in separate jars per treatment within blocks.
- Duration: monitored until second clutch; daily observations; transfers to fresh media every other day.

## Measurements and traits
- Sampling points: neonate stage, maturity (first eggs in brood pouch), and second clutch release.
- Imaging: neonates photographed and body size measured via ImageJ.
- Offspring and growth metrics: number of offspring in first and second clutch; moult events; ages at maturation and after clutches; juvenile and adult growth rates; mean fecundity; mean offspring size.
- Morphometrics: length at neonate, maturity, and second clutch; neonate mean size per clutch.
- Thermal tolerance: CT max measured after 15 min acclimation at 21°C, ramping from 21°C to 50°C at 40 s/°C.
- Dataset scope: eight life-history traits plus thermal tolerance per individual.

## Data collection and processing
- Quality control: data are checked, verified, and processed for analysis.
- Data structure: dataset organized with detailed metadata and trait records for each individual across treatments and blocks.

## Data structure and accessibility
- Data format: comma-separated values (CSV).
- Data set 1: Multivariate plasticity data set with fields including clone, block, tray, temperature, food, replicate, treatment, offspring counts (cl1No, cl2No), moult indicators, ages (Agemat, Age1cl, Age2cl), sizes (Lneo, LMat, L2cl, cl1size, cl2size), thermal-tolerance date and metrics (Htdate, Tfaint, Timm), observer, clutch presence during CTmax, HTBatch, mean offspring and size metrics (aveclNo, aveoffsize), growth rates (grjuv, grad), and population origin (Pop).

## Relevance to environmental health monitoring and policy
- Demonstrates a rigorous, multi-trait, genotype-by-environment approach suitable for informing environmental health indicators and monitoring frameworks.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - factorial designs to capture plastic responses to key environmental stressors (temperature and food availability).
  - standardized data collection, including precise metadata (treatment conditions, blocks, replicates) and stable measurement protocols (imaging, CTmax assays).
  - data quality assurance and transparent data processing to support policy evaluation and future decision-making.
- Provides a rich, openly structured data framework (CSV with explicit variable definitions) that can be used to benchmark environmental responses and to calibrate indicators of aquatic organism health under climate-related scenarios.
- Notes practical considerations for monitoring frameworks: data completeness and standardization challenges, need for metadata completeness, potential for maternal and block effects, and the value of sharing underlying data and protocols to enable broader use in policy contexts.
