- Site information
  - Climoor/Clocaenog field site is a climate-change manipulation experiment (initiated 1998) using automated roof technology to create drought and warming treatments reflecting 20–30 year climate projections.
  - Location: Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales (53°03'19"N, -03°27'55"W)
  - Habitat: upland west-Atlantic moorland; dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather) with Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum also present
  - Vegetation overview (1998 baseline): Calluna vulgaris shrubs (~98% cover; ~2485 g m^-2 biomass); Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum present; bryophytes substantial (73% cover; ~520 g m^-2 biomass)
  - Growing season: June–August; shoulder seasons April–May and September–October; winter dormancy November–February
  - Soil: humo-ferric podzol; horizons Eg and Bh variably visible; typical horizon depths around 6–17 cm (Eg) with Bh below
  - Climate (1997–2014): mean air temp ~8.0 °C; mean soil temp in control ~7.5 °C; mean annual rainfall ~1411 mm; total N-deposition ~20–25 kg N ha^-1 yr^-1
  - Vegetation and soil chemistry data provided (detailed tables for species, biomass, C/N, nutrient content, and soil properties across horizons)

- Climate change treatment information
  - Treatments and layout
    - Two treatments: drought and warming
    - Replicates: 3 per treatment; 3 control plots (n=9 total)
  - Drought treatment
    - Mechanism: retractable polyethylene roof activated by tipping-bucket rainfall sensor
    - Rainfall reduction: ~20% annually; during drought months (May–Sept originally) up to ~80% of rain excluded due to sensor thresholding
    - Temporal scope: drought operation May–Sept (1999–2011); since 2012, April–October
    - Operational caveats: roofs do not operate in high winds (>10 m s^-1); since 2016, issues with rainwater accumulation on roofs affected retraction
  - Warming treatment
    - Mechanism: retractable aluminium mesh curtains to reflect infrared radiation; reduces night-time heat loss
    - Control of rainfall: curtains retract when rain detected to prevent rainfall loss; some rainfall excluded due to response lag
    - Operational caveats: curtains not used in high winds (>10 m s^-1)
  - Maintenance and upgrades
    - 2016: frames showed wear; 2017: new frames installed on top of old frames to minimize vegetation disruption
  - Treatment timing data
    - Table 6(a): Drought treatment yearly data including annual and growing-season rainfall reductions
    - Table 6(b): Warming treatment data with calculated growing degree days (GDD) and percent change due to warming
    - GDD calculations based on plot air temperature; values provided per year with notes on when warming roofs operated separately from drought roofs

  - Storage rain gauge data (5.2)
    - Site-level rainfall: 12.7 cm funnel; biweekly collection; used as the primary robust dataset due to logger/power reliability
  - Throughfall data (5.3)

    - Biweekly collection; data processing uses site-level rainfall to derive plot-level rainfall via percent change
    - Data quality: plot means sometimes exclude replicates when data are compromised; occasional infilling with average reductions across years
  - Data processing notes
    - Throughfall percent changes applied to site rainfall; data exclusions for damaged/missing equipment
    - Some datasets not stored in EIDC after June 2015
