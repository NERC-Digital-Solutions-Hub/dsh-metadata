# Supporting documentation for data:

- The document provides a comprehensive dataset and accompanying files to reproduce Feeney et al. (2022) on forecasting river erosion hazards to electricity transmission towers along the River Mersey using CAESAR-Lisflood.
- Part of the UK Climate Resilience Programme; aims to support transparency and learning about CAESAR-Lisflood applications at reach-scale.

## Overview and scope
- Focus: hydro-sedimentary modelling of river erosion threats to transmission infrastructure in an urban river valley.
- Reach: ~4.5 km of the River Mersey near Partington, UK.
- Time horizon: present day to 2050.
- Scenarios: 6 future flow magnitudes (Baseline, +10% to +50%) combined with two erosion calibrations (Low and High), yielding 12 simulations.
- Outputs include model inputs/outputs, derivative GIS-ready products, and scripts to reproduce analyses.

## Data content and structure
- Six main folder groups:
  - Calibrated Runs
    - High and Low erosion calibration configurations with input files (bedrock, erosion.xml, historic_flows.txt, mersey_dem_15m.txt, mersey_seds_15m.txt) and results (animations, d50top, elev, elevdiff, grain, Mersey_outputQ&s.txt, waterdepth).
  - Channel_Changes
    - Change_19762019.shp (digitised river channel changes); Changes_comared.csv (eroded/deposited areas by period and model).
  - DoD (Difference of DEMs)
    - EA_LIDAR_diffs, High_ero_diffs, Low_ero_diffs, Scenarios (raster stacks of DoDs and related outputs; includes raster_to_points shapefiles for tower risk analysis).
    - Sampled_values.csv (erosion/deposition totals by DoD).
  - Flows
    - High and Low subfolders with historic_flows.csv, Exceedance_probabilities_of_GEFs.csv, Sediment_fluxes.csv (for six future flow scenarios).
  - R_scripts
    - Seven R scripts to reproduce analyses and figures (Calibration_DoDs.R, Calibration_TimeSeries.R, DoD_histograms.R, Flow_Stats.R, Flow_TimeSeries.R, Scenario_erodep_pdfs.R, Scenario_TimeSeries.R) plus a READ ME and an R project file.
  - Towers
    - Changes_at_towers (Tower_summaries.csv and 2019-2050 files for High/Low erosion; yearly erosion/deposition per tower).
    - Shapefiles (National Grid towers with 30 m and 75 m buffers).
    - Tower_LookUp_Table.csv (tower-specific erosion hazard categories and erosion/deposition metrics).
- Third-party datasets and external sources with citations and URLs:
  - CAESAR-Lisflood and tools
  - EA DEM data
  - NRFA daily flow data
  - BGS UKSO materials
  - National Grid tower data
  - EDINA OS maps and imagery

## Data collection and generation methods
- Primary data sources (Jan 2020):
  - NRFA daily flows (Ashton Weir; 1976–2018) for calibration and flow-driven processes.
  - Environment Agency LiDAR-derived DTMs (resampled to 15 m for inputs).
  - BGS soil textures from UKSO for sediment grain sizes (9 fractions in CAESAR-Lisflood).
  - OS base maps and aerial imagery (1976, 1993, 2005, 2019) and 2005 imagery for channel change mapping.
- Modelling approach:
  - CAESAR-Lisflood simulates river channel evolution from 1976 to 2018 (two calibrations: High and Low erosion).
  - Six future flow scenarios generated by scaling historical flows and sediment fluxes to 2018–2050.
  - 8-PC Liverpool cluster used for simulations; outputs feed DoDs, tower risk maps, and related figures.

## Data types, units, and formats
- Detected data types:
  - Raster/ASCII grid data (DEM, bedrock, sediment, DoDs, grain size, water depth, elevations).
  - Vector shapefiles (river channel changes; towers and buffers; DoD intersections with tower buffers).
  - ASCII text files for model inputs/outputs (d50top, elev, elevdiff, grain.dat, Mersey_outputQ&s, waterdepth).
  - CSV files for summary statistics, changes, and tower lookup.
- Units:
  - Erosion/deposition in m^2/yr (rates), elevations and flow depths in m, discharge in m^3/s, sediment flux in m^3/day (and per grain size fraction).
  - DoDs in meters (elevation differences).
- Compatibility:
  - GIS-ready outputs suitable for ArcMap/ArcGIS workflows and standard GIS software (ASCII rasters, shapefiles, CSVs).

## CAESAR-Lisflood inputs and outputs
- Inputs required by CAESAR-Lisflood:
  - DEM mersey_dem_15m.txt
  - bedrock.txt (modified bedrock with lower values; buildings treated as unerodible)
  - historic_flows.txt (14 columns: day, discharge, placeholders, and 10 sediment flux columns)
  - Grain size input file (grid cell coordinates, identifiers, 9 sediment fractions across 11 blocks)
  - Model configuration XML (editable; to replicate results use provided files or Table S1 guidance)
- Outputs produced (scenario-focused):
  - d50top{n}.txt (surface median grain size per cell)
  - elev.dat{n}.txt (elevation per cell)
  - elevdiff{n}.txt (net elevation change; positive = erosion)
  - grain.dat{n}.txt (updated grain-size layers per cell)
  - waterdepth{n}.txt (water depth per cell)
  - Mersey_outputQands.txt (daily flow and sediment loads)
  - Animation PNGs and animation.kml for Google Earth visualization
- DoD-focused outputs (for scenarios):
  - DoD ASCII rasters and derived products in DoD folders
  - Raster_to_Points tools for creating tower-risk vectors

## Reproducibility and tooling
- CAESAR-Lisflood software:
  - Version used: 1.9j (download recommended for replication)
- Analyses and figures:
  - R (version 4.x) used for most analyses; scripts provided to reproduce results
  - R project file included with dataset
- Outputs include materials to reproduce both calibration and future-scenario runs, plus visualization assets (animations, KML).

## External and third-party data sources
- CAESAR-Lisflood and utilities
- Environment Agency LiDAR DEMs
- NRFA daily flow data
- BGS UKSO soil materials
- OS/EDINA base maps and aerial imagery
- National Grid transmission towers data
- Links provided within the dataset documentation for each source

## Quality control and reproducibility notes
- CAESAR-Lisflood is deterministic; identical inputs plus same calibration yield the same results.
- All inputs/files were checked with reproducible R scripts and published to enable verification.
- Documentation includes explicit instructions to reproduce results using the same CAESAR-Lisflood version and provided configuration files, or by populating inputs per Table S1 of the associated paper.
