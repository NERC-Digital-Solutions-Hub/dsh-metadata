# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog forest using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming over the next 20–30 years.
- Location: Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales; evergreen heather-dominated upland moorland; established in 1998 with replicated drought and warming treatments and control plots.
- On-site data are collected across a wide range of environmental, plant, and soil measurements to support long-term ecological and climate-change research.

## Data and datasets (data types, frequency, and scope)

- AWS meteorological data (daily, 1999–present): air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, air pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind speed/direction.
- Micro-meteorological plot data (daily, 1998–present): plot-level soil/air temperatures, soil moisture (various methods over time).
- Rainfall at site level and rainfall chemistry (biweekly): storage rain gauge data and rain chemistry (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium) with lab analyses.
- Throughfall data (plot level rainfall, biweekly): plot-level rainfall collected per plot; used to derive treatment-specific rainfall changes relative to site rainfall.
- Water table depth (biweekly, from 2009): measurements via permeable tubes down to bedrock.
- Soil respiration (fortnightly, 1998–present): CO2 efflux measured with collars and chambers; multiple instrumentation epochs (CIRAS-2, LI-COR 8100, automated collars from 2013+).
- Trace gases (CH4 and N2O; 1999–2000, 2007–2009): static chamber measurements with gas chromatography.
- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE; 2002–2004, 2011): chamber-based CO2 flux with PAR/temperature sensors; includes respiration correction using biomass.
- Photosynthesis (2001–2003 for some species): leaf-level measurements using CIRAS-2 and standard leaf cuvettes.
- Vegetation survey data (plant biomass; multiple years): Pin-point method across three quadrats per plot; biomass calibration via destructive sampling; conversion factors provided.
- Canopy reflectance (2000–2004; 2001–2002 for some plots): ground-based spectrometry; NDVI and PRI indices calculated.
- Vegetation phenology, annual growth, and pathogen assessment (1998–present): shoot elongation, budburst, flowering; 30 shoots per species per year in selected years.
- Vegetation chemistry (1998–present): carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates in green and litter material.
- Litterfall (1999–2002; later less frequent): collected with litter traps; dried and weighed; carbon/nitrogen analyses.
- Root biomass (2003–2013): cores and sieving; multiple methods across years; different depths and extraction approaches.
- Soil microbial biomass (2000–2001, 2012): chloroform fumigation-extraction with DOC analysis; reported as mg microbial biomass C per g soil organic matter.
- Nitrogen mineralisation (1998–2004): paired cores with KCl extraction to determine ammonium/nitrate production.
- SOM, SOC and bulk density (linked to N-mineralisation study): core-based measurements; organic/inorganic horizon separation; density calculations; biomass context.
- Soil solution and leachate chemistry (1998–2008): lysimeters and tension lysimeters; pH, nitrate, chloride, sulfate, DOC, ammonium analyses.

## Data processing and quality

- Data are accompanied by detailed supporting documentation (rtf) describing sensors, methods, and analysis procedures for each dataset.
- Unit conversions and data processing are specified (e.g., converting CO2 flux to mg C m-2 h-1; CIRAS vs. LICOR unit translations).
- Legacy data may not reflect current best practices in data processing; some datasets require careful provenance tracing.
- Data quality control historically relied on visual checks in Excel; some data gaps or infill occur (e.g., throughfall corrections, plot exclusions when data loss occurred).

## Data governance, storage, and access

- On-site datasets are cataloged with dataset names and corresponding supporting documentation; not all data are stored in the EIDC.
- Data management guidance and access: contact CEH Bangor personnel for details on datasets not stored in the EIDC.
- Primary contacts for data: Sabine Reinsch (sabrei@ceh.ac.uk) and Bridget Emmett (bae@ceh.ac.uk).
- Data uploading and cataloging into appropriate data portals is part of the published practice, with ongoing updates and potential embargo handling described in the documentation.

## Appendix and site specifics

- Appendix 1: Site layout and grid references (includes coordinates SJ019519; 53.055N, -3.465W).
- Appendix 3: Plot and quadrat layout showing LYS (lysimeters), PQ (point quadrats), SS (soil suction samplers).
- The field site features three main treatments (drought, warming) with replicates and control plots; drought reduces rainfall via a retractable roof, warming uses retractable infrared-reflective curtains, with wind-speed limits for curtain operation.

## Practical notes for data stewards

- Ensure metadata consistency across datasets (sensors, time scales, units, and calibration notes).
- Record provenance and instrument changes (e.g., shifts from CIRAS-2 to LI-COR, automated collars in 2013) for reproducibility.
- Maintain cross-links between datasets (e.g., vegetation biomass for NEE adjustments; biomass data used in photosynthesis and flux calculations).
- Be aware of data gaps and plot-level data exclusions due to data loss or equipment issues; document any imputation or exclusion criteria.
- Coordinate with CEH Bangor contacts for access to non-EIDC datasets and for ongoing data updates.
