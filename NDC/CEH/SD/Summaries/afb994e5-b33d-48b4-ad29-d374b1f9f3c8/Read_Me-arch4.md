# Details of data structure

- This appears to be supporting documentation for a data series encompassing daily micrometeorological (micromet) observations at Clocaenog, covering 1998 to 2015.
- The materials likely describe the structure of the dataset, including data fields, formats, units, timestamps, and metadata schema.
- The documentation supports understanding data provenance, discovery, and potential integration with other data products.
- For Data Leaders, the document highlights the importance of clear metadata and data structure to enable data discovery, assess suitability, and plan for data governance and reuse.
- Key considerations for applying this in practice:
  - Define and confirm data fields, units, timestamps, and data types.
  - Ensure comprehensive metadata and data provenance are captured.
  - Assess data quality and identify gaps or granularity limitations.
  - Verify access, licensing, and any protection barriers affecting use.
  - Align structure with broader data models to facilitate interoperability and sharing.
- Potential next steps:
  - Retrieve and review the data dictionary or data dictionary equivalents (variable definitions, units, allowed values).
  - Map the Clocaenog micromet data to existing data governance and discovery systems.
  - Plan for data integration, updates, and long-term stewardship.
