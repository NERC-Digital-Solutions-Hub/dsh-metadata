# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

## Overview
- Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment in Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, established 1998.
- Aims to simulate drought and warming for upland moorland ecosystems over 20–30 years.
- Dominant vegetation is Calluna vulgaris (heather) with additional taxa; soil is humo-ferric podzol.
- Experimental design includes replicated drought (D), warming (W), and control (C) plots across three blocks (total n=9 plots; 3 replicates per treatment).
- Automated roof and aluminium curtain technologies enable drought and warming treatments, respectively; treatments are wind-limited to protect equipment.

## Climate change treatments
- Drought treatment: retractable polyethylene roof over each plot during May–Sept (1999–2011; since 2012 April–October), reducing annual rainfall by ~20% and excluding ~80% of rain during the growing season; mirrors UK droughts (e.g., 1995). Wind (>10 m s-1) stops roofing to prevent damage.
- Warming treatment: retractable aluminium mesh curtains retained at night to reduce heat loss; roof retraction during rain prevents rainfall loss. Night-time infrared reflectivity reduces heat loss by ~64%; annual rainfall reduction ~14% due to retraction delays.
- Treatment timing and replication documented per year (Tables detailing dates, reductions in annual/growing-season rainfall, and warming growing degree days).

### 3.9 Photosynthesis
- Infrequent measurements (2001–2003) using leaf cuvettes and CIRAS-2; standardization for light response; leaf mass measurements accompany species data.

### 3.10 Vegetation survey data (plant biomass) – Pin-point method
- Annual surveys (1998–2012, with gaps) across three quadrats per plot; pin-hits recorded by species and structure; biomass calibrated using species-specific conversion factors; pins adjusted for missing pins; descriptive tables for codes and biomass conversions.

### 3.11 Canopy reflectance
- Ground-based spectrometer measurements (2001–2002, 2003–2004); NDVI and PRI indices calculated from spectral bands; background spectra collected for calibration.

### 3.12 Vegetation phenology, annual growth and pathogen assessment
- Spring phenophase and shoot elongation measured for Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum (2000, 2002, 2004; and additional years for certain species); budburst stages documented; growth metrics collected through late summer.

### 3.13 Vegetation chemistry

### 3.14 Litterfall
- Litterfall collectors deployed; monthly collection 1999–2002, then less frequent; samples dried, pooled by quadrat, weighed, and converted to g m-2; subset analyzed for elemental composition.

### 3.15 Root biomass

## Data governance, accessibility and quality considerations
- Data are diverse, spanning meteorology, hydrology, soil biogeochemistry, vegetation dynamics, and gas fluxes; several datasets are legacy with non-uniform documentation.
- Public sharing and metadata completeness can be barriers; some data are not stored in central repositories (EIDC) and require direct contact with CEH Bangor personnel.
- QA largely relies on visual checks and standardized conversion factors; some best-practice documentation for data processing is acknowledged as incomplete for legacy periods.
- Throughfall and rainfall data handling involves data loss considerations and infilling to maintain comparability across plots and years.

## Key implications for monitoring frameworks
- The Climoor dataset offers a comprehensive suite of environmental health indicators under controlled climate manipulations, useful for evaluating policy targets related to drought resilience, warming effects, and ecosystem carbon balance.
- Challenges to reproducibility and policy-use include data fragmentation across multiple streams, legacy data quality, variable metadata, and access barriers.
- To strengthen monitoring frameworks:
  - Ensure centralized, well-documented metadata and data provenance for all data streams.
  - Harmonize units, conversions, and calibration procedures across time periods and instruments.
  - Implement standardized data governance, licensing, and open-data practices to facilitate reuse.
  - Maintain robust QA processes and implement data retention strategies to mitigate loss of critical long-term datasets.
  - Facilitate timely data access for policy analysis by consolidating datasets and providing clear contact points.

## Data management recommendations for policy-oriented monitoring
- Create a centralized metadata catalog covering all datasets (scope, methods, units, timeframes, QA notes, access).
- Standardize data formats and units; document all conversion factors and calibration protocols.
- Establish data governance, including versioning, provenance trails, and data-sharing licenses.
- Promote openness while balancing data privacy and sensitivity by delineating data-sharing rules at the dataset level.
- Invest in ongoing documentation of legacy data processing steps to improve transparency and repeatability.
- Provide stakeholder-facing dashboards and summaries that translate complex measurements (e.g., NEE, Rs, CH4/N2O fluxes) into policy-relevant indicators (carbon balance, drought impact, warming trends, ecosystem resilience).
