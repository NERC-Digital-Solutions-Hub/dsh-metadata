# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

## Overview
- Automated climate manipulation experiment (drought and warming) at Clocaenog upland moorland, reflecting predicted climate change for next 20–30 years.
- Established in 1998; sites use solar/wind power and automated roof technology to create drought and warming treatments.
- Comprehensive, multi-disciplinary data collection spanning meteorology, soil/plant processes, biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation structure.

## Site and environment
- Location: Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales (coordinates 53°03′19″N, -3°27′55″W).
- Ecosystem: Wet upland heath dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather) with Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum; diverse mosses and other moss/lichen species.
- Soil: Humo-ferric podzol with variable horizon visibility (E and Bh horizons); typical depths of horizons described where evident.
- Climate indicators (summary): mean annual air temperature ~8.0°C; mean soil temperature in control plots ~7.5°C; mean annual rainfall ~1411 mm; total N deposition ~20–25 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹.
- Vegetation and ecological data collected across multiple years, including biomass, phenology, chemistry, and litter dynamics.

## Climate change treatments and experimental design
- Treatments: three warming plots, three drought plots, and three control plots (total n=9), arranged in blocks.
- Drought treatment: May–September (historically 1999–2011; since 2012 April–October) using retractable polyethylene roofs that exclude rainfall, reducing site rainfall by ~20% and excluding ~80% of rain events within treatment plots.
- Warming treatment: night-time warming via retractable aluminium mesh curtains that reflect infrared radiation, reducing heat loss; curtains retract in rain to avoid rainfall exclusion. Nightly triggering after dusk with wind-exclusion safeguards (>10 m s⁻¹).
- Experimental specifics: replicated plots (4 m × 5 m) with scaffolding in controls to mirror shading effects; treatment timing and reductions vary by year (detailed year-by-year data provided in tables within the documentation).
- Administrative notes: data and methods compiled to enable long-term monitoring and comparison across treatments and years.

## Data collected and datasets (data inventory)
- AWS meteorological data (daily, 1999–present): temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, air pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind speed/direction.
- Micro-meteorological (plot-scale) data (daily, 1998–present): soil/air temperatures and soil moisture at multiple depths.
- Rainfall data (site level) and rainfall chemistry: storage rain gauge and biweekly chemical analyses (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium).
- Throughfall data (plot level rainfall): biweekly measurements used to derive plot-level rainfall adjustments for treatment comparisons.
- Water table depth: biweekly measurements from 2009 onwards using permeable tubes down to bedrock.
- Soil respiration: fortnightly measurements (historical methods; 1999–2014 with automation introduced 2013–2014) from soil collars; unit conversions described for several instruments.
- Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): measurements using static chambers and gas chromatography; multiple measurement periods (1999–2000; 2007–2009).
- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): logged in 2002–2004 and 2009–2011 using Perspex/LI-COR systems; includes adjustments for biomass differences within chambers.
- Photosynthesis: infrequent measurements (2001–2003 for some species) with leaf cuvettes and CIRAS-2 system.
- Vegetation surveys and biomass (Pin-point method): yearly/biennial surveys (1998–2012; continued irregularly thereafter) with species-specific calibration to biomass.
- Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometry (2000–2004; limited 2001–2004).
- Vegetation phenology, growth, and pathogens: spring phenophases, shoot elongation, leaf numbers, and pathogen indicators (1999–2009 and beyond in selected years).
- Vegetation chemistry: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, and carbohydrates in green and litter material.
- Litterfall: collectors deployed; collected 1999–2002 (monthly), later less frequent; carbon and nitrogen analyses performed.
- Root biomass: multiple years (2003, 2004, 2008, 2011) using cores and different extraction methods.
- Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation methodology (2000, 2001, 2012).
- Nitrogen mineralisation: soil-core incubation to estimate net mineralisation and ammonification rates (1998–2004).
- SOM, SOC and bulk density: soil core analyses linked to N-mineralisation studies; made to derive g m⁻² metrics.
- Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers, biweekly sampling (1998–2008); analyses for pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, and ammonium.
- Appendix data: site layout and quadrat layout to contextualise plots and measurement areas.

## Data collection methods and equipment
- On-site AWS (daily): high-positioned mast (4 m) due to prior thefts; sensors for temperature, humidity, rainfall, pressure, net radiation, PAR, solar and wind metrics.
- Micro-met data: soil and air temperatures, soil moisture with depth-specific sensors; high-resolution (minute-level with hourly averages).
- Rainfall and throughfall: storage rain gauge (robust to logger/power issues) and plot-level throughfall collectors; data harmonized to site rainfall metrics.
- Soil and plant measurements: soil respiration and trace gas fluxes using closed chamber systems, IRGAs, and LI-COR analysers; NEE measurements using two generations of chamber systems.
- Vegetation and litter: pin-point biomass estimation with calibration against destructive sampling; litter traps and subsequent chemical analyses.
- Lab analyses: standard methods for chemistry (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium), carbon/nitrogen, lignin, tannin, cellulose, and other proxies.

## Data processing, quality control, and notes
- Data processing: various unit conversions to CO2 flux metrics; Rs calculated via linear regression from time-series CO2 concentrations; biomass-adjusted NEE and photosynthesis calculations.
- Legacy data caveat: some data processing steps reflect older practices; documentation notes indicate not all steps meet current best practice standards.
- Quality control: basic visual QC in Excel for most sensors; acknowledgement that automated threshold scripts were not always used due to contextual memory of site conditions.
- Data accessibility: not all data stored in a single portal (EIDC); some datasets may be maintained locally or outside standard portals; contact CEH Bangor staff (Sabine Reinsch, Bridget Emmett) for access details.

## Key points for environmental monitoring analysts
- Comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, long-term dataset enabling assessment of environmental health and treatment effects under climate manipulation.
- Standardized yet evolving measurement techniques across meteorology, soils, vegetation, and biogeochemical processes.
- Clear documentation of treatment design, data types, sampling frequencies, and conversion methods essential for cross-study comparability.
- Notable data challenges include data integration across diverse datasets, legacy data processing nuances, and partial data archival in centralized repositories.
