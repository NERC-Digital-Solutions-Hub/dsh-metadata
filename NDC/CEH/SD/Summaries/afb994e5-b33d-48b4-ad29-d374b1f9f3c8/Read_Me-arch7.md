# Clocaenog supporting documentation: Data series and daily micromet data (1998–2015) – Details of data structure

- What this document collection includes
  - Clocaenog_supporting_documentation_Data series.rtf (supporting documentation for the data series)
  - SD_Daily_micromet_data_1998to2015_Clocaenog.rtf (details of the data structure for daily micrometeorological data, 1998–2015)

- Purpose for GIS specialists
  - Provides metadata and data-structure information to support creating map-based data products
  - Helps with understanding data provenance, variable definitions, units, and sensor types

- Expected contents relevant to GIS use (inferred)
  - Variable definitions, units, and data schema
  - File formats, timestamp formats, and data organization
  - Spatial context: site location, coordinate reference system (CRS), and any station layout
  - QA/QC procedures, data cleaning methods, and handling of missing data

- GIS workflow implications
  - Use metadata to correctly interpret variables and units in maps and analyses
  - Ensure consistent CRS and proper alignment of time-series data for visualizations
  - Assess data resolution and plan integration with other datasets
  - Split large datasets into manageable chunks and document any transformations

- Potential challenges to anticipate
  - Data stored in multiple locations and formats
  - Gaps or missing data at required resolutions
  - Inconsistent data standards across sources
  - Significant data cleaning and transformation work required
  - Possible need for specialized skills to manage complex datasets

- Next steps for practical use
  - Access both RTf documents to gather full metadata and structure details
  - Extract variable definitions, units, data schema, and QA/QC notes
  - Prepare GIS-ready layers with appropriate CRS, time handling, and documented metadata
