# Abundance, biomass and elemental composition (CNP) of consumers in the Hampshire Avon [Macronutrient Cycling]

## Overview
- A dataset of annual average abundance, biomass, and elemental composition (C, N, P) of aquatic consumers (fish and invertebrates) in 6 streams tributaries of the Hampshire Avon, spanning contrasting geology (clay, greensand sandstone, chalk) and a gradient of base flow index.
- Collected under the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project to understand lateral exchange and seaward C, N, P fluxes.

## Data content and scope
- Macroinvertebrates
  - Density (numbers m^-2) and biomass (g m^-2) by taxon, estimated from Surber sampling (0.06 m^2, 300 μm mesh) with 10 sample units every two months (stratified-random design).
  - Taxa identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level (usually species); body mass estimated from length via published regressions; biomass computed as mean mass × density.
- Fish
  - Density and biomass estimated by two-pass depletion electrofishing from stop-netted reaches; body length and mass measured prior to release.
  - Small benthic species (e.g., bullhead) estimated with a modified Hess sampler; additional sampling conducted as needed.
- Elemental composition
  - May and October collections for C, N, and P analyses.
  - Macroinvertebrates and selected fish specimens collected; samples prepared (frozen, dried, homogenised) for elemental analysis (C and N via elemental analyser; P via spectrophotometry after digestion).
  - Mass spectrometry data corrected for drift; all measurements checked against detection limits and calibration standards.
- Data quality and verification
  - Taxonomic identifications performed by individuals with >10 years of experience and Natural History Museum ID Q EO62 credentials.
  - Rigorous error checking, calibration, and re-analysis where necessary; use of certified reference materials for chemical analyses.

## Spatial and temporal coverage
- Streams and sites (with identifiers, catchments, and grid refs):

  - AS2, River Sem, Share Farm; Grid Ref ST9234327392
  - GA1, River East Avon, Marden; Grid Ref SU0973457808
  - GN2, River Nadder, Share Farm; Grid Ref ST9235527364
  - CE1, River Ebble, Stoke Farthing; Grid Ref SU0567225325
  - CW2, River Wylye, Brixton Deverill; Grid Ref SU1723143894
- Timeframe
  - Start and end dates range from February 2013 to May 2014, with site-specific durations (e.g., AS1 13/02/2013–20/05/2014, AS2 05/02/2013–01/12/2014, GA1 08/02/2013–19/05/2014, GN2 05/02/2013–01/12/2014, CE1 06/02/2013–19/05/2014, CW2 07/02/2013–16/10/2013).
  - Data collected to reflect a gradient in geology and base flow index across streams.

## Methods and data collection workflow
- Macroinvertebrates
  - Surber sampling (0.06 m^2; 300 μm mesh); 10 units per sampling event; preserved in 4% formalin; sorted and identified to species where possible.
  - Individual measurements to 0.1 mm; dry mass estimated from length-mass regressions; biomass calculated from mean mass × density.
- Fish
  - Two-pass depletion electrofishing; stop-netted reaches; anesthesia used; length and mass measured.
  - Small benthic taxa measured via a modified Hess sampler (0.12 m^2) with multiple deployments.
- Elemental analysis
  - May/October samples for CPOM, FPOM, periphyton, and whole animals (for C, N, P).
  - Sample processing: freezing, drying to constant mass, homogenisation; half samples for C and N (Flash EA 1112); half for phosphorus (EPA-119-A Rev. 3 method) after digestion.
- Quality controls
  - Calibration against standards; repeated measurements for precision; checks to ensure data above detection limits; drift corrections for mass spectrometry; re-analysis when values fell outside calibration ranges.

## Data provenance and stewardship
- Collected by the River Communities Group, QMUL, as part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project (NE/J012106/1).
- Project lead: Dr. John Iwan Jones (QMUL) with overall responsibility for data collection.
- Data generated by the authors; extensive verification and quality assurance undertaken before acceptance.

## Practical applications for GIS and mapping
- Spatial analysis-ready data across six streams with explicit site coordinates and catchment contexts (geology, base flow gradient).
- Suitable for map-based visualisations of:
  - Taxon-specific abundance and biomass distributions.
  - Spatial patterns in macroinvertebrate and fish communities.
  - Elemental composition profiles (C, N, P) linked to taxa and sampling sites.
  - Relationships between biotic metrics and environmental drivers (geology, hydrology, base flow index).
