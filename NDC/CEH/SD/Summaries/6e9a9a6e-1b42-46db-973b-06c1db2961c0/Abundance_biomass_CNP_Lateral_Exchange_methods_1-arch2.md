# Abundance, biomass and elemental composition (CNP) of consumers in the Hampshire Avon [Macronutrient Cycling]

## Overview
- Dataset on abundance, biomass and elemental composition (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) of stream consumers (fish and invertebrates) in six Hampshire Avon tributaries.
- Part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project investigating lateral exchange and seaward C, N, P flux; coordinated by River Communities Group, QMUL.
- Sites span contrasting geology (clay, greensand sandstone, chalk) with a gradient in base flow index; data collected during 2013–2014.

## Data collected and measurement approach
- Macroinvertebrates:
  - Density: macroinvertebrates quantified as numbers per square metre using Surber sampling (0.06 m2; 300 µm mesh); 10 sample units every two months in stratified-random design.
  - Identification: taxa identified to lowest possible taxonomic level, usually species.
  - Biomass: individual masses estimated from linear dimensions (0.1 mm precision) using published length-mass regressions; biomass (g m-2) = mean mass × density.
- Fish:
  - Density and biomass estimated via two-pass depletion electrofishing on stop-netted reaches; measured body length and mass recorded; specimens returned after anaesthesia.
  - Small benthic species (e.g., bullhead) estimated via modified Hess sampler (0.12 m2) with 20 deployments per date.
- Elemental composition and material pools (May & October sampling):
  - Select material from numerically dominant or trophically important taxa collected in-stream.
  - Fish: three individuals per species sacrificed for analysis.
  - Invertebrates: similar-sized individuals analysed; CPOM/FPOM fractions collected from depositional habitats; periphyton scraped from stones.
  - Processing: samples frozen, then dried (85°C to constant mass), homogenised; whole animals homogenised for analysis.
  - C and N: analysed with elemental analyzer (Flash EA 1112).
  - P: determined spectrophotometrically after digestion (potassium persulphate, H2SO4) using EPA method.
  - For mass spectrometry data, drift-corrected using control standards; detection limits checked; samples re-analysed if necessary.

## Study design: sites and timeline
- Six stream sites on the Hampshire Avon system:
  - AS1, River Sem., Priors Farm (Grid ST8916428436). Start 13/02/2013; End 20/05/2014; No. days 461.
  - AS2, River Sem., Share Farm (ST9234327392). Start 05/02/2013; End 01/12/2014; No. days 664.
  - GA1, River East Avon, Marden (SU0973457808). Start 08/02/2013; End 19/05/2014; No. days 465.
  - GN2, River Nadder, Share Farm (ST9235527364). Start 05/02/2013; End 01/12/2014; No. days 664.
  - CE1, River Ebble, Stoke Farthing (SU0567225325). Start 06/02/2013; End 19/05/2014; No. days 467.
  - CW2, River Wylye, Brixton Deverill (SU1723143894). Start 07/02/2013; End 16/10/2013; No. days 222.
- Sites reflect a gradient in geology and base flow characteristics; sampling aligned with the project “The role of lateral exchange in modulating the seaward flux of C, N, P” (NE/J012106/1).

## Data quality, provenance and QA
- Taxonomic identifications performed by experienced personnel (Natural History Museum IdQ EO62 standard).
- All data checked for errors prior to acceptance; chemical data validated against certified reference materials; repeated measurements to confirm precision.
- Calibration and drift corrections applied for analytical instruments (including MS data); all values checked against detection limits; re-analysis performed if necessary.
- Calculations verified to prevent errors before data acceptance.

## Data content and variables
- Abundance metrics: macroinvertebrate density (numbers m^-2); fish density where applicable.
- Biomass metrics: biomass (g m^-2) for macroinvertebrates and fish.
- Elemental composition: percentages or concentrations of C, N, and P in sampled organisms.
- Material fractions: CPOM and FPOM fractions, plus periphyton-derived material from stone surfaces.
- Metadata: site identifiers, GPS grid refs, start/end dates, sampling days, and methodology details.

## Data management and access
- All data were generated by the authors; data processing and quality assurance followed standardized, published protocols.
- Data generated under the Macronutrient Cycles project; linked to NE/J012106/1.
- Data handling included clear documentation of methods, taxonomic references, and mass-length relationships used for biomass estimates.

## Usage notes and potential integrations
- Suitable for cross-site comparisons across geology and base flow gradients, and for temporal analyses within 2013–2014.
- Can be combined with other environmental data (e.g., lateral exchange fluxes, stream chemistry) to assess whole-system nutrient cycling and ecosystem health.
- Useful for validating or informing nutrient and energy flow models in stream ecosystems.
- Standardised methods and QA enable data reuse in meta-analyses and in policy-monitoring contexts.
