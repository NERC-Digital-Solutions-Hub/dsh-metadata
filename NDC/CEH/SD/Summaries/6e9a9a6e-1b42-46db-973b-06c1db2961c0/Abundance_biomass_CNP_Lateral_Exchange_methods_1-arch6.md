# Abundance, biomass and elemental composition (CNP) of consumers in the Hampshire Avon [Macronutrient Cycling]

## Overview
- Data collected by the River Communities Group, QMUL, as part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project (NE/J012106/1) to quantify abundance, biomass, and elemental composition (C, N, P) of aquatic consumers in six Hampshire Avon streams with contrasting geology.
- Focus on macroinvertebrates (fish and invertebrates) across streams representing clay, greensand sandstone, and chalk geologies, reflecting a gradient in base flow index.
- Includes detailed sampling, laboratory analyses, data quality checks, and site metadata to enable downstream analyses of C, N, and P fluxes in stream ecosystems.

## Data collected
- Macroinvertebrates
  - Density: macroinvertebrate density (numbers m^-2) via Surber sampling (0.06 m²; 300 µm mesh); 10 sample-units every two months in stratified-random design.
  - Biomass: body mass estimated from measured length using published length-mass regressions; biomass (g m^-2) computed as mean mass × numerical density per taxon.
  - Identification: taxa identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level (usually species); identifications performed by experts with >10 years experience; NHM IdQ EO62.
  - Preservation and processing: samples preserved in 4% formalin in the field; later processed and homogenised for biomass estimation.
- Fish
  - Density and biomass: estimated via two-pass depletion electrofishing from stop-netted reaches; body length and mass recorded; specimens returned after processing.
  - Small benthics: estimated with a modified Hess sampler (0.12 m²), 20 deployments per date.
- Elemental composition (C, N, P)
  - Sampling: May and October collections focused on numerically dominant or trophically important taxa; material collected via kick sampling and electrofishing; three specimens of each species sacrificed for analysis.
  - Particulate and periphyton material: in-stream CPOM and FPOM collected, processed, and fractionated; periphyton scraped from stones.
  - Processing: samples frozen, then dried and homogenised; half for C and N content via elemental analyzer; half for total phosphorus via spectrophotometry after digestion.
  - Mass specs: for mass spectrometry data, drift correction performed offline using control standards; all values checked against detection limits.

## Data quality and validation
- Taxonomic identifications conducted by experienced personnel; quality checks confirmed accuracy of identifications.
- Chemical data validated using certified reference materials; precision ensured via repeat measurements and calibration standards.
- Data consistency checks: measured values compared to calibration standards; samples recalculated or re-analysed if necessary.
- Analytical QA: drift correction for mass spectrometry; all reported values confirmed to be above detection limits.

## Site metadata and sampling timeline
- Stream sites (used by all project partners): AS1, AS2 (River Sem; Priors Farm; Share Farm); GA1 (River East Avon; Marden); GN2 (River Nadder; Share Farm); CE1 (River Ebble; Stoke Farthing); CW2 (River Wylye; Brixton Deverill).
- Grid references and dates: provides precise locations and durations (start/end dates and total days) for each site, reflecting sampling across 2013–2014.

## Data structure and potential use
- Outputs include:
  - Species- and taxon-level abundance and biomass for macroinvertebrates.
  - Fish density and biomass estimates.
  - Elemental composition data (C, N, P) for selected taxa and fractions.
  - Associated metadata: site, date, sample method, and QA records.
- Potential analyses:
  - Linking consumer biomass and elemental composition to stream geologies and base flow indices.
  - Investigating trophic transfer and macronutrient cycling (C, N, P) across streams.
  - Assessing data quality and comparability across sites and sampling dates.
- Data use considerations: focus on enabling data discovery and self-service exploration for end users; ensure careful interpretation given taxon- and date-specific sampling.
