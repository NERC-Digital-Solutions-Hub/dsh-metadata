# Abundance, biomass and elemental composition (CNP) of consumers in the Hampshire Avon [Macronutrient Cycling]

- This dataset provides annual average abundance, biomass, and elemental composition (C, N, P) of macroinvertebrates and fish across six streams in the Hampshire Avon catchment, reflecting contrasting geology and base-flow indices.
- Collected under the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project, “The role of lateral exchange in modulating the seaward flux of C, N, P” (NE/J012106/1). Dr John Iwan Jones (QMUL) had overall responsibility for data collection.

## What was measured

- Macroinvertebrate data:
  - Density (numbers m^-2) and biomass (g m^-2) across taxa, estimated from Surber samples.
  - Taxa identified to the lowest practicable level (usually species); dry mass estimated from length-mass regressions.
- Fish data:
  - Density and biomass estimated via two-pass depletion electrofishing; body length and mass measured.
  - Small benthic species sampled with a Hess-type sampler to obtain additional metrics.
- Elemental analysis (C, N, P):
  - May and October sampling focused on elemental composition of numerically dominant or trophically important taxa.
  - Additional materials collected: CPOM/FPOM fractions, periphyton, and, for fish and key invertebrates, sacrificed specimens for elemental analysis.
  - Half of each sample used for C and N analysis (elemental analyser); the other half for total phosphorus by spectrophotometry after digestion.
- Sample processing and QA:
  - Samples frozen, dried, and homogenised; analyses calibrated against standards; checks for accuracy, precision, and detection limits.
  - For mass spectrometry data, drift corrections applied; all reported values checked against calibration standards.

## Methods

- Macroinvertebrates:
  - Surber sampling: 0.06 m^2, 300 µm mesh, 10 sample units every two months in stratified-random design; preserved in 4% formalin in the field.
  - Identification by experienced taxonomists; body mass estimated from species-specific length-mass relationships.
- Fish:
  - Two-pass depletion electrofishing from stop-netted reaches; anaesthetised fish measured for length and mass before release.
  - Small benthic species sampled with a modified Hess sampler.
- Elemental analyses:
  - In May/October: selective sampling of dominant/trophically important taxa, plus CPOM/FPOM, and periphyton samples.
  - C and N measured with Flash EA 1112; P determined after digestion using EPA-based methods.
- Data quality control:
  - Independent verification by experienced personnel; use of certified reference materials; repeated measurements where needed; checks to ensure values meet detection limits and calibration ranges.

## Data governance and use for Data Leaders

- Provenance and scope:
  - Data produced by the study authors with taxonomic identifications by experienced personnel; alignment with project objectives on nutrient cycling and lateral exchange.
- Data quality and reproducibility:
  - Comprehensive QA/QC processes described (calibration, detection limits, reference standards, drift corrections) to support reliable reuse.
- Metadata and discoverability:
  - Detailed site information, sampling dates, methods, and units are provided, enabling cross-site comparisons and integration with broader data networks.
- Potential uses and coordination:
  - Supports assessment of data gaps, planning of future sampling, and collaborative work across networks focused on data sharing, data standards, and nutrient cycling analyses.
- Considerations for data management:
  - The dataset includes multiple related components (macroinvertebrates, fish, and elemental analyses) across several sites and timepoints, underscoring the need for clear, harmonised metadata and consistent formats for long-term discoverability and reuse.
