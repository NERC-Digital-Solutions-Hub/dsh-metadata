# Abundance, biomass and elemental composition (CNP) of consumers in the Hampshire Avon [Macronutrient Cycling]

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset on abundance, biomass, and elemental composition (C, N, P) of consumers (fish and macroinvertebrates) in six Hampshire Avon tributaries.
  - Part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project exploring lateral exchange and seaward flux of C, N, P.
  - Sites reflect contrasting geology (clay, greensand sandstone, chalk) with a gradient in base flow index; aims to support understanding of nutrient cycling in freshwater systems.

- Study design and sampling
  - Macroinvertebrates: density (numbers m^-2) and biomass (g m^-2) estimated for taxa via Surber sampling (0.06 m^2, 300 µm mesh), 10 samples every two months in stratified-random design.
  - Fish: density and biomass estimated by two-pass depletion electrofishing from stop-netted reaches; body length and mass measured post-capture.
  - Additional material for elemental analysis collected May and October from dominant taxa; fish specimens sacrificed (3 per species) for C, N, and P analyses.
  - In-stream organic matter: CPOM/FPOM fractions collected; periphyton scraped from stones for analysis.
  - Samples preserved and stored under cold conditions; materials prepared for dry mass and homogenization before chemical analyses.

- Analytical methods
  - Elemental composition: carbon and nitrogen via elemental analyzer (Flash EA 1112); phosphorus via spectrophotometry after digestion.
  - Mass determinations: species- and size-specific dry mass estimated using published length–mass relationships; species identified by experienced taxonomists with museum-grade expertise.
  - Calibration and quality checks: calibration standards, certified reference materials, and repeat measurements to ensure accuracy and precision; mass spectrometry data corrected for drift; detection limits verified.

- Data quality, provenance, and governance
  - All data generated by the project authors and subjected to error checking before acceptance.
  - Independent verification of identification by taxonomic experts; use of established regression relationships for mass estimation.
  - Documentation includes start and end dates, site codes, and geographical references to enable traceability and reproducibility.
  - Data governance practices implied (transparent QA/QC, clear data lineage), though explicit public data sharing policies are not stated in the provided text.

- Sites and timeline
  - Six stream sites within the Hampshire Avon system:
    - AS1 (River Sem., Priors Farm) – 13/02/2013 to 20/05/2014
    - AS2 (River Sem., Share Farm) – 05/02/2013 to 01/12/2014
    - GA1 (River East Avon, Marden) – 08/02/2013 to 19/05/2014
    - GN2 (River Nadder, Share Farm) – 05/02/2013 to 01/12/2014
    - CE1 (River Ebble, Stoke Farthing) – 06/02/2013 to 19/05/2014
    - CW2 (River Wylye, Brixton Deverill) – 07/02/2013 to 16/10/2013
  - Temporal scope spans 2013–2014 with varying durations per site (days ranging roughly 222–664).

- Data content and variables
  - Abundance and biomass metrics for macroinvertebrates (density, biomass by taxa) and fish (density, biomass by species).
  - Elemental composition data (C, N, P) for selected macroinvertebrate taxa and fish.
  - Physical and biological descriptors (body size measurements, taxonomic identifications, CPOM/FPOM fractions, periphyton mass).
  - Metadata: site identifiers, grid references, start/end dates, sampling effort, and methods.

- Relevance for monitoring and policy
  - Demonstrates integration of ecological abundance, biomass, and elemental nutrient data to inform nutrient cycling and trophic dynamics in riverine systems.
  - Provides a framework for QA/QC, data provenance, and standardized analytical workflows valuable for monitoring programs.
  - Supports evaluation of policy decisions related to nutrient flux and ecosystem health through robust, multi-matrix measurements and transparent documentation.

- References and standards
  - Data collection and analysis anchored in established methods (Surber sampling, electrofishing, length–mass regressions, EPA-approved phosphorus analysis).
