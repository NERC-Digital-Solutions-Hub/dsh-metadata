# Abundance, biomass and elemental composition (CNP) of consumers in the Hampshire Avon [Macronutrient Cycling].

## Overview
- Dataset from the River Communities Group, Queen Mary University of London, under the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project “The role of lateral exchange in modulating the seaward flux of C, N, P” (NE/J012106/1).
- Measures annual average abundance, biomass, and elemental composition of consumers (fish and invertebrates) in 6 streams that are tributaries of the Hampshire Avon, spanning contrasting geology (clay, greensand sandstone, chalk) and a gradient of base flow index.
- Data were collected under the leadership of Dr John Iwan Jones (QMUL).

## Dataset scope and contents
- Variables include macroinvertebrate density (numbers m^-2), biomass (g m^-2), and elemental composition (C, N, P) for consumers; in-stream particulate organic matter (CPOM/FPOM) and periphyton fractions also collected for analysis.
- Elemental analyses: C and N by elemental analyser; total P by spectrophotometry after digestion; half-split samples used for separate analyses.
- All data generated by the study authors; taxa identifications performed by experienced personnel (NHM IdQ EO62 standard).

## Sampling design and data collection
- Macroinvertebrates: density and biomass quantified with Surber sampling (0.06 m^2, 300 µm mesh), 10 sample units every two months in stratified-random design.
- Fish: density and biomass estimated via two-pass depletion electrofishing from stop-netted reaches; measurements taken under anaesthesia; large/benthic taxa sampled with a modified Hess sampler.
- May and October sampling focused on elemental composition analyses of selected taxa (dominant or trophically important species); three specimens per species sacrificed for analysis when possible.
- Additional material collected for CPOM/FPOM fractions, and periphyton removed from stones for analysis.

## Analytical methods
- Elemental composition: C and N by Flash EA 1112; calibration with known standards.
- Phosphorus: total P measured spectrophotometrically after digestion (hot potassium persulphate and 1N H2SO4) using EPA-119-A Rev. 3 method; determined with a Seal AQ2 autoanalyser.
- Mass determination: body mass estimated from length-mass regressions for macroinvertebrates; biomass calculated as mean mass × numerical density.
- Quality checks: samples checked for analytical accuracy using certified reference materials; precision checks and calibration range verification; mass spectrometry data corrected for drift; all reported values verified against detection limits and recalculated as needed.

## Data quality, provenance, and governance
- Taxonomic identifications conducted by individuals with >10 years of experience; identification aligns with Natural History Museum standards.
- Multiple QA steps described to ensure data accuracy, precision, and consistency; data validation included checks for errors in calculations and measurements.
- Project provenance: data tied to the broader project NE/J012106/1 and site metadata applicable to all partners.
- Documentation references provided for length-mass relationships (e.g., Benke et al. 1999; Burgherr & Meyer 1997; Edwards et al. 2008, 2009; Meyer 1989; Smock 1980) and population parameter estimation methods (Seber & Le Cren 1967).

## Site metadata and temporal coverage
- Monitoring sites and identifiers: AS1, AS2 (River Sem; Priors Farm; coordinates provided), GA1 (River East Avon; Marden), GN2 (River Nadder; Share Farm), CE1 (River Ebble; Stoke Farthing), CW2 (River Wylye; Brixton Deverill).
- Start and end dates roughly 2013–2014 with specified durations (AS1: 13/02/2013–20/05/2014; AS2: 05/02/2013–01/12/2014; GA1: 08/02/2013–19/05/2014; GN2: 05/02/2013–01/12/2014; CE1: 06/02/2013–19/05/2014; CW2: 07/02/2013–16/10/2013).
- Grid references and day counts recorded for reproducibility and cross-partner applicability.

## Data management implications for data stewards
- Rich multi-domain dataset (biology, chemistry, physical measurements) requiring consistent metadata standards (sites, taxa, units, methods, QA steps).
- Standardized sampling and analysis methods facilitate interoperability with other datasets in macroecology and nutrient cycling studies.
- Clear provenance and QA documentation support data trustworthiness and reproducibility; suitable for publishing pipelines and data catalogs.
- Potential considerations for future updates include ongoing data collection across sites, harmonization of taxonomic names, and alignment with metadata schemas.
