# Abundance, biomass and elemental composition (CNP) of consumers in the Hampshire Avon [Macronutrient Cycling]

## Aim and scope
- Dataset of annual average abundance, biomass, and elemental composition (C, N, P) of consumers (fish and macroinvertebrates) in six streams that are tributaries of the Hampshire Avon.
- Sites chosen to reflect contrasting geology (clay, greensand sandstone, chalk) and a gradient in base flow index.
- Part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project examining lateral exchange and modulation of seaward C, N, P flux.
- Time frame: data collected during 2013–2014.

## Data collected
- Macroinvertebrates:
  - Density (numbers per m²) and biomass (g m⁻²) quantified per taxon.
  - Identification to the lowest possible taxonomic level (usually species).
- Fish:
  - Density and biomass estimated via two-pass depletion electrofishing; body length and mass recorded.
  - Small benthic species additionally estimated by a modified Hess benthic sampler.
- Elemental composition:
  - In May and October, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content analyzed; phosphorus (P) determined spectrophotometrically.
  - Analyses conducted on selected numerically dominant or trophically important taxa; CPOM/FPOM and periphyton collected and analyzed for C, N, and P as part of the same campaigns.
- Sample processing:
  - Macroinvertebrates preserved in 4% formalin, transported, and later homogenised for mass calculations.
  - Fish specimens sacrificed (for elemental analyses) and preserved appropriately for later lab work.
  - All samples frozen, dried, and homogenised prior to analyses.

## Sampling design and timeline
- Macroinvertebrate sampling:
  - Surber sampler (0.06 m², 300 µm mesh).
  - 10 sample units per date, every two months, stratified-random design.
- Fish sampling:
  - Two-pass depletion electrofishing; stop-netted reaches; length and mass measured pre-release.
  - Bullhead and small benthic taxa supplemented with Hess sampler sampling.
- Site list (six streams):
  - AS1 (River Sem, Priors Farm), AS2 (River Sem, Share Farm)
  - GA1 (River East Avon, Marden)
  - GN2 (River Nadder, Share Farm)
  - CE1 (River Ebble, Stoke Farthing)
  - CW2 (River Wylye, Brixton Deverill)
- Time frame per site:
  - Start dates mostly Feb–Feb 2013; end dates vary from Feb 2013 to Oct 2014; study duration per site ranges roughly 467–664 days.

## Laboratory analyses and QA
- Invertebrate biomass estimated from measured body mass (via length-mass regressions) multiplied by density.
- Elemental C and N analyses via Flash EA 1112 after appropriate sample preparation; P via digestion and spectrophotometry (EPA method 119-A Rev. 3).
- Calibration, drift correction, and quality checks:
  - Use of certified reference materials; repeat measurements to ensure precision.
  - Mass spectrometry data drift corrected offline using control standards.
  - All measurements checked against detection limits; re-analysis performed if necessary.
- Taxonomic identification performed by experienced personnel (NHM IdQ EO62 standard).

## Data provenance and accessibility
- All data generated by the study authors; data quality checked prior to acceptance.
- Data collected under the project “The role of lateral exchange in modulating the seaward flux of C, N, P” (NE/J012106/1).
- Datasets and related metadata are prepared to be discoverable and usable, with traceable data sources and methods.

## Potential analyses and applications
- Correlate consumer abundance/biomass and elemental composition with geology and base flow index to infer controls on macronutrient cycling.
- Develop predictive relationships linking macroinvertebrate/fish community structure to C, N, P fluxes in stream networks.
- Integrate with environmental covariates (e.g., hydrology, substrate, organic matter inputs) to model nutrient transfer across stream corridors.
- Use length-mass regressions and allometric relationships to compare across streams and taxa, enabling cross-site meta-analyses.
