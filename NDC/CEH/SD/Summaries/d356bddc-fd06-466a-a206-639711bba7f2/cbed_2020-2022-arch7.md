# Overview

- The Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology generates 1x1 km gridded data for:
  - deposition of sulphur (oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia) onto vegetation
  - base cations (Ca, Mg)
  - ammonia concentration (grid-cell level)
  - with a 3-year mean basis and rolling 3-year means for two ecosystem types
- Deposition is calculated as dry deposition (gases and PM onto vegetation) and wet deposition (precipitation, including occult deposition to vegetation)
- Outputs are downscaled from 5x5 km to 1x1 km using bilinear interpolation to support habitat- and grid-scale analyses
- A grid-average deposition is provided for total deposition load, while habitat-specific deposition is mapped using moorland/short vegetation or forest/woodland land-cover types

- Data inputs, modelling and calibrations
  - Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 measurement sites
  - NO2 and SO2 from PCM model (interpolated measurements + point/line sources)
  - Ammonia concentrations (3x3 km) from EMEP4UK (EMEP MSC-W model)
  - UK NH3 emissions from NAEI; non-UK emissions from CEIP data
  - Meteorology driven by WRF v4.4.2 with ECMWF ERA-5 reanalysis (0.25°) every 6 hours
  - Ammonia concentrations calibrated to NAMN measurements using linear regression
  - Orographic enhancement applied for upland precipitation concentrations
  - Inter-annual variability acknowledged; CBED outputs averaged over a 3-year period to smooth fluctuations

- Temporal and ecosystem specifics
  - Data are annual values but provided as rolling 3-year means
  - Two ecosystem types per grid cell:
    - moorland/short vegetation
    - forest/woodland
  - For critical load exceedance calculations, moorland deposition is applied to non-woodland habitats and forest deposition to woodland habitats
  - Grid-average deposition is suitable for total deposition load (e.g., catchments), not habitat-specific rates

- Data structure and formats
  - 3-year mean ecosystem-specific deposition data (keq ha-1 year-1)
  - Files (examples):
    - CBED-deposition-moorland-2020-2022.csv
    - CBED-deposition-forest-2020-2022.csv
    - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2020-2022.csv
    - CBED-ammonia-conc-2020-2022.csv
  - Each row includes easting and northing (centre of 1x1 km grid), followed by deposition values for the relevant component (e.g., NOx, NHx, NMS, NM_CA) and land-cover specific columns
  - Units:
    - Deposition values: kilo-equivalents per hectare per year (keq ha-1 year-1)
    - Ammonia concentration: μg m-3
  - Conversion factors (for GIS-derived equivalents):
    - Sulphur deposition: keq ha-1 year-1 × 16 = kg S ha-1 year-1
    - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition: keq ha-1 year-1 × 14 = kg N ha-1 year-1
    - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg): keq ha-1 year-1 × 20 = kg Ca ha-1 year-1

- Quality control and methodological governance
  - Extensive peer review and participation in Defra model inter-comparison exercises
  - Methods published in peer-reviewed literature
  - Centralized versioning and code storage; mass-balance checks ensure numerical consistency
  - Documentation of method developments and senior oversight

- Data accessibility and references
  - Resource locators provide access to supporting information and network data
  - Key references underpinning data sources and methods (e.g., UKEAP NAMN, EMEP4UK, WRF ERA-5, PCM, RoTAP)

- Practical GIS implications
  - Suitable for map-based visualization of deposition pressures at 1x1 km resolution
  - Supports habitat-specific deposition mapping and total deposition load assessment
  - Rolling 3-year means help smooth inter-annual variability for stable analysis
  - Ammonia calibration enhances spatial accuracy against observed monitoring data
