# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- Produces 1x1 km gridded deposition data for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations at UK-wide resolution
- Combines measured atmospheric concentrations and precipitation data with modelled patterns to derive wet and dry deposition
- Distinguishes deposition to two ecosystem types (moorland/short vegetation and forest/woodland) and provides a grid-average deposition as well
- Outputs are provided as rolling 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability

## Data inputs and sources

- Dry deposition drivers:
  - Gas and particulate matter concentrations across grids
  - Spatially distributed habitat-specific deposition velocities for five land-cover types (forest, moorland, fertilised grassland, arable, urban)
- Wet deposition drivers:
  - Annual precipitation map from the UK Met Office
  - Orographic enhancement factor for upland regions (seeder-feeder effect)
- Specific data sources:
  - Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 measurement sites
  - NO2 and SO2 from the Pollution Concentration Mapping (PCM) model
  - Ammonia concentrations from EMEP4UK at 3x3 km resolution; UK NH3 emissions from NAEI (1x1 km)
  - Non-UK emissions from EMEP at 0.1° x 0.1° (CEIP)
  - Meteorology driving the model: WRF v4.4.2 with ERA-5 reanalysis (0.25° x 0.25°) every 6 hours
- Temporal aspects:
  - Latest year uses current meteorology with emissions from the previous year
  - Inter-annual variability acknowledged; results averaged over three years

## Modelling and calibrations

- Atmosphere-chemistry transport model: EMEP4UK, driven by WRF with ERA-5 reanalysis
- Ammonia concentrations calibrated lower in model outputs using linear regression against NAMN measurements
- Orographic enhancement factored into wet deposition calculations
- Three-year averaging used to reduce year-to-year variability in deposition results
- Calibration and modelling validation supported by peer-reviewed work and Defra inter-comparison exercises

## Spatial resolution, deposition types, and data structure

- Original modelling at 5x5 km, downscaled to 1x1 km using bilinear interpolation
- Deposition types per grid cell:
  - Moorland deposition: nox_m (oxidised nitrogen), nhx_m (reduced nitrogen), nms_m (non-marine sulphur), nm_ca_mg_m (non-marine base cations)
  - Forest deposition: nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f
  - Grid-average deposition: nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga

  - CBED-deposition-forest-2020-2022.csv
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2020-2022.csv
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2020-2022.csv
- Key fields:
  - Easting and northing (centre of 1x1 km grid square)
  - Deposition values in keq ha^-1 year^-1 for each component
- Units and conversion:
  - All deposition values in kilo-equivalents per hectare per year (keq ha^-1 yr^-1)
  - Conversions to kg S ha^-1 yr^-1, kg N ha^-1 yr^-1, or kg Ca ha^-1 yr^-1 provided via multipliers (e.g., keq × 16 for S, ×14 for N, ×20 for Ca)

## Temporal aspects and data interpretation

- Outputs are annual values, presented as rolling 3-year means
- Separate deposition metrics for short vegetation and forest/woodland within each grid cell
- Grid-average deposition is suitable for total catchment assessments; habitat-specific deposition should be used for habitat-level analyses

## Quality assurance and provenance

- Extensive peer review over years; included in Defra model inter-comparison exercises
- Method developments documented, versioned, and stored in a central repository
- Mass balance checks performed to ensure numerical consistency and comparability with previous years
- Data and methods are published in peer-reviewed literature with clear documentation of inputs, calibrations, and procedures

## Practical notes for Data Leaders

- CBED data support understanding of total deposition load (grid-average) and habitat-specific deposition (moorland vs forest)
- Do not apply grid-average deposition directly to habitat-specific assessments without appropriate land-cover weighting
- Ammonia calibration relies on NAMN measurements and may involve year-specific scaling
- Data are anchored to specific UK sources (PCM, EMEP4UK, NAMN, NAEI) and meteorological drivers (WRF/ERA-5)
- Access and traceability are supported by dedicated datasets and reporting portals linked in the CBED documentation
