# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology (e.g. RoTaP, 2012)

- Purpose and outputs
  - Produces 1x1 km gridded deposition data for: sulphur (S), oxidised nitrogen (NO2/NO3), reduced nitrogen (NH3/NH4), ammonia concentration, and non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg).
  - Deposition is derived from measured atmospheric concentrations and precipitation ions, plus modeled ammonia concentration patterns.
  - Distinguishes dry deposition (gases and PM onto vegetation) and wet deposition (precipitation and occult deposition to vegetation).
  - Provides grid-averaged deposition across five land-cover categories and downscales 5x5 km results to 1x1 km using bilinear interpolation.
  - Useful for total deposition load assessments (e.g., catchments) and for habitat- or ecosystem-specific analyses.

- Deposition types and ecosystem mapping
  - Dry deposition includes SO2, HNO3, NO2, NH3, and PM onto vegetation.
  - Wet deposition covers sulphate, ammonium, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, and acidity, including cloud droplet deposition ('occult' deposition).
  - Critical loads: moorland/short vegetation values applied to non-woodland habitats; forest values applied to woodland habitats.
  - Grid-average deposition is not habitat-specific but informs total deposition loads.

- Data inputs, modelling, and calibrations
  - Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 from Position-Continuous Mapping (PCM) model, combining rural measurements with point/line-source modeling.
  - Ammonia concentrations (3x3 km) from EMEP4UK (EMEP MSC-W model); UK NH3 emissions from NAEI at 1x1 km; non-UK emissions from CEIP-provided 0.1° grid.
  - EMEP4UK year outputs are per-year; the most recent year uses the previous year’s emissions with that year’s meteorology due to data lags.
  - Meteorology driven by WRF v4.4.2 with ERA5 reanalysis (0.25° grid, 6-hour updates).
  - Ammonia concentrations calibrated to NAMN measurements via linear regression, using stations with ≥70% annual coverage and excluding non-representative sites.
  - Orographic enhancement applied to precipitation concentration in upland regions (seeder-feeder effect).
  - Inter-annual variability: deposition estimates averaged over a three-year period to smooth variability; data are annual but supplied as rolling 3-year means.

- Time, resolution, and data presentation
  - Annual deposition values presented as rolling 3-year means.
  - Ecosystem types provided per grid cell: short vegetation and forest/woodland.
  - Deposition rates expressed per area: keq ha-1 yr-1.

- Data structure and files (examples)
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2020-2022.csv: easting, northing, and moorland oxidised nitrogen, reduced nitrogen, non-marine sulphur, non-marine base cations (keq ha-1 yr-1).
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2020-2022.csv: easting, northing, and forest oxidised nitrogen, reduced nitrogen, non-marine sulphur, non-marine base cations (keq ha-1 yr-1).
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2020-2022.csv: easting, northing, and grid-average oxidised nitrogen, reduced nitrogen, non-marine sulphur, non-marine base cations (keq ha-1 yr-1).
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2020-2022.csv: easting, northing, ammonia concentration (μg m^-3).
  - Each row uses 1x1 km grid center coordinates (OS Great Britain grid) in metres.

- Units, conversions, and interpretation
  - All deposition values: keq ha-1 year-1.
  - Conversions to kg S ha-1 year-1, kg N ha-1 year-1, or kg Ca ha-1 year-1 are provided (e.g., multiply by 16 for S, by 14 for N, by 20 for Ca+Mg).
  - Data tailored for habitat- or ecosystem-specific analyses, with separate moorland and forest/woodland deposition and a grid-average proxy.

- Quality control and validation
  - Subject to extensive peer review and part of Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
  - Method developments sanctioned by senior officers; documented with version control and central code storage.
  - Mass-balance checks and comparisons against previous years to ensure numerical consistency.
  - Broad publication in peer-reviewed literature.

- Access and references
  - Resource links include CBED-related UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Atmospheric Pollutants data portals and supporting information.
  - References cover RoTAP, NAMN, UKEAP, EMEP4UK, PCM, ERA5/WRF, and related atmospheric chemistry and deposition modeling literature.

- Practical notes for analysts
  - CBED provides habitat-relevant deposition estimates at 1x1 km resolution, with robust QA and three-year smoothing to reduce inter-annual noise.
  - Downscaling from 5x5 km to 1x1 km introduces interpolation assumptions; grid-averaged values remain suitable for whole-catchment assessments.
  - Calibrated ammonia concentrations improve alignment with ground measurements, enhancing deposition estimates in ammonia-influenced regions.
  - Data accessibility includes structured CSV datasets and metadata, facilitating integration with other environmental datasets and modelling workflows.
