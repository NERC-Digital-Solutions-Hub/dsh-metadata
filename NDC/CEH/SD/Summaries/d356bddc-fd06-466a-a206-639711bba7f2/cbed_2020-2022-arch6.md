# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- Produces 1x1 km gridded deposition data for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations at UK scale.
- Combines measured gas/particle concentrations, ions in precipitation, and spatial patterns of ammonia; uses UKEAP data as input.
- Outputs include wet deposition, dry deposition, and grid-average deposition, with downscaling from 5x5 km to 1x1 km resolution.

## Data Outputs and Structure

- Three ecosystem-specific deposition data files per period (2020–2022):
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2020-2022.csv
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2020-2022.csv
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2020-2022.csv
- Each file includes:
  - Easting and northing (center of 1x1 km grid square)
  - Deposition components in keq ha-1 year-1:
    - Moorland: oxidised nitrogen (nox_m), reduced nitrogen (nhx_m), non-marine sulphur (nms_m), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_m)
    - Forest: oxidised nitrogen (nox_f), reduced nitrogen (nhx_f), non-marine sulphur (nms_f), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_f)
    - Grid average: oxidised nitrogen (nox_ga), reduced nitrogen (nhx_ga), non-marine sulphur (nms_ga), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_ga)
- Additional file:
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2020-2022.csv (ammonia concentration, μg m-3, 3 km grid resolution, landcover-independent)
- 3-year means are provided (rolling) for annual data, with deposition given on a per-area basis (kg ha-1 yr-1 when converted).

## Modelling, Data Inputs, and Calibration

- Nitric acid concentrations: interpolated from ~30 measurement sites.
- NO2 and SO2: from the PCM model (interpolation of rural measurements plus point/line source contributions).
- Ammonia: concentrations from EMEP4UK (3 km) with UK emissions from NAEI (1 km when UK), and non-UK emissions from CEIP data.
- Meteorology: WRF v4.4.2 driven; ERA-5 reanalysis data used for assimilation every 6 hours.
- Calibration: EMEP4UK ammonia outputs calibrated to NAMN measurements via linear regression; stations with poor representativeness or insufficient data excluded.
- Orographic enhancement: applied to wet deposition in upland regions based on observed altitude effects.
- Temporal variability: significant inter-annual variation due to weather; CBED deposition for exceedance calculations is averaged over a 3-year period; outputs are annual values but presented as rolling 3-year means (short vegetation vs forest/woodland per grid cell).

## Resolution, Habitat Assignment, and Use

- Wet deposition incorporates precipitation data with an upland enhancement factor; dry deposition accounts for gases (SO2, HNO3, NO2) and PM (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, Ca, Mg) onto vegetation.
- 5x5 km estimates are downscaled to 1x1 km by bilinear interpolation.
- Habitat-specific deposition:
  - Moorland data used for all non-woodland habitats (bogs, heaths, semi-natural grasslands).
  - Forest data used for woodland habitats.
  - Grid-average deposition serves general load assessments (e.g., catchment-scale analyses); not suitable for habitat-specific deposition.

## Data Quality and Documentation

- CBED data and calculations have undergone extensive peer review and inter-comparison (Defra-related QA practices).
- Methods are published in peer-reviewed literature; developments are version-controlled; central storage for code and documentation.
- Mass-balance checks ensure numerical consistency and comparability with previous years.

## Conversions and Units

- All deposition values are in keq ha-1 yr-1.
- Conversions:
  - Keq to kg S ha-1 yr-1: multiply by 16 (for sulphur)
  - Keq to kg N ha-1 yr-1: multiply by 14 (for oxidised/reduced nitrogen)
  - Non-marine base cations: keq ha-1 yr-1 multiplied by 20 (to kg Ca ha-1 yr-1)

## Practical Use and Access

- Outputs enable broad data exploration, self-service analysis, and creation of dashboards or reports for stakeholders.
- Useful for total deposition load assessments (catchment level) and habitat-specific deposition analyses (critical-load exceedance context).
- Supports monitoring, policy planning, and communications around atmospheric deposition and ecosystem impacts.
