# Overview

- The Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology (e.g. RoTaP, 2012) produces 1x1 km gridded data of deposition for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations in vegetation.
- Data are derived from measured air concentrations and precipitation ions, combined with modelled ammonia concentration patterns, using a 5x5 km precipitation map downscaled to 1x1 km.
- Deposition is separated into dry deposition (gases and PM onto vegetation) and wet deposition (precipitation deposition plus occult deposition).

## What CBED outputs and how it is used

- For each grid cell, a Grid Average deposition is computed by weighting dry deposition by land-cover areas (forest, moorland, fertilised grassland, arable, urban).
- Habitat-specific deposition: moorland/short vegetation values applied to non-woodland habitats; forest values applied to woodland habitats.
- Wet deposition includes precipitation deposition and occult deposition onto vegetation; maps cover sulphate, ammonium, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, and acidity.
- Outputs are provided as rolling 3-year means (annual values averaged over a 3-year period) to smooth inter-annual weather variability.
- Deposition data are presented as 3-year means for two ecosystem types within each grid cell and as grid-average deposition. Units are keq ha-1 year-1.

## Data inputs, modelling and calibrations

- Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 measurement sites.
- NO2 and SO2 concentrations from the PCM model (combines rural measurements with point/line source contributions).
- Ammonia concentrations (3 km x 3 km) from EMEP4UK; UK NH3 emissions from NAEI (1x1 km); non-UK emissions from EMEP at 0.1° resolution (CEIP for 0.1° data).
- Most recent year uses meteorology from ERA-5 with emissions from the previous year due to data lags.
- WRF v4.4.2 drives EMEP4UK with ERA-5 data assimilation; ammonia model outputs are calibrated to observed NAMN measurements via linear regression (stations with ≥70% annual coverage; some exclusions for non-representative sites).
- Orographic enhancement for wet deposition uses a factor derived from Great Dun Fell and HOLME Moss measurements.
- Inter-annual variability is acknowledged; three-year averaging is used to produce CBED outputs.

## Data outputs and file structure

- Three 3-year mean, ecosystem-specific deposition CSVs:
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2020-2022.csv
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2020-2022.csv
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2020-2022.csv
- One 3-year mean ammonia concentration CSV:
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2020-2022.csv
- Each file includes:
  - easting and northing (metres; OS Great Britain grid centre for each 1x1 km cell).
  - Deposition columns by type:
    - Moorland: nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m, nm_ca_m
    - Forest: nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f
    - Grid average: nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga
  - Ammonia concentration column in the ammonia file: nh3_c (μg m-3)
- Nature of the values: all deposition values are keq ha-1 year-1; conversions to kg S, N, or Ca are provided.

## Units, conversions

- keq ha-1 year-1 for all deposition values.
- To convert:
  - Sulphur deposition: keq ha-1 year-1 × 16 = kg S ha-1 year-1
  - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition: keq ha-1 year-1 × 14 = kg N ha-1 year-1
  - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg): keq ha-1 year-1 × 20 = kg Ca ha-1 year-1

## Quality control and governance

- CBED data and calculations have undergone extensive peer review and participated in Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
- Method development is overseen by senior responsible officers; documentation uses consecutive version numbers; code stored in a central file system.
- Mass balance checks are routinely performed; deposition estimates are compared to previous years for consistency.
- Outputs and methods are documented in peer-reviewed literature and project reports (e.g., RoTAP, UKEAP NAMN, etc.).
