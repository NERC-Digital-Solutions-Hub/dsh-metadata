# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- The CBED methodology produces 1x1 km gridded data of deposition for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations, using measured air concentrations, precipitation ions, and modelled ammonia patterns.
- Deposition is separated into wet and dry components and mapped for five land cover categories (forest, moorland, fertilised grassland, arable, urban); dry deposition includes gases (SO2, HNO3, NO2, NH3) and particulate matter onto vegetation, while wet deposition includes precipitation and occult deposition (cloud droplets) onto vegetation.
- Outputs are provided as annual values but averaged over rolling 3-year means to dampen inter-annual variability; results are given per grid cell for two ecosystem types (short vegetation/moorland and forest/woodland) and as a grid-average for total deposition load (e.g., catchments).
- Grid-downscaling: 5x5 km grid estimates are downscaled to 1x1 km using bilinear interpolation.

## Data inputs, modelling and calibrations

- Nitric acid concentrations: interpolated from ~30 monitoring sites.
- NO2 and SO2: from the Pollution Concentration Mapping (PCM) model, combining rural measurements with emissions from point/line sources.
- Ammonia concentrations: from EMEP4UK (3x3 km resolution); UK NH3 emissions from NAEI (1x1 km); non-UK emissions from CEIP (0.1° grid).
- Emissions for current year: meteorology from ERA5-based WRF driving model; latest year uses current meteorology with previous year’s emissions due to data lag.
- Meteorology: WRF v4.4.2 with ERA5 reanalysis assimilation (0.25° resolution, 6-hour updates).
- Calibration: ammonia model outputs scaled to measured concentrations using NAMN stations with at least 70% data coverage; stations with non-representative locations are excluded.
- Orographic enhancement: wet deposition includes a seeder-feeder related factor derived from upland observations (Great Dun Fell and Holme Moss).
- Inter-annual variations: CBED deposition data are averaged over a 3-year period to smooth variability.

## Data values, units and interpretation

- All deposition values are expressed as kilo-equivalents per hectare per year (keq ha-1 yr-1).
- Conversion to standard mass units:
  - Sulphur deposition (S): keq ha-1 yr-1 × 16 = kg S ha-1 yr-1
  - Oxidised and reduced nitrogen (N): keq ha-1 yr-1 × 14 = kg N ha-1 yr-1
  - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg): keq ha-1 yr-1 × 20 = kg Ca ha-1 yr-1
- Data include deposition to moorland (short vegetation), forest/woodland, and grid-average across each 1x1 km grid cell.
- Dry deposition includes gases and PM onto vegetation; wet deposition includes deposition from precipitation and occult deposition to vegetation.

## Data structure and files

Three-year mean deposition data are provided for:
- CBED-deposition-moorland-2020-2022.csv
  - Columns include easting, northing (grid centre in metres) and deposition for oxidised nitrogen (nox_m) and reduced nitrogen (nhx_m), non-marine sulphur (nms_m), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_m).
- CBED-deposition-forest-2020-2022.csv
  - Columns include easting, northing and deposition for oxidised nitrogen (nox_f), reduced nitrogen (nhx_f), non-marine sulphur (nms_f), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_f).
- CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2020-2022.csv
  - Columns include easting, northing and grid-average depositions: nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga.
- CBED-ammonia-conc-2020-2022.csv
  - Columns include easting, northing and ammonia concentration (nh3_c) at 3x3 km resolution (μg m-3).

Note: Each row corresponds to the centre coordinates of a 1x1 km grid cell, with ecosystem-type specific values and grid-average values.

## Quality control and governance

- CBED has undergone extensive peer review over multiple years and participated in Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
- Methods are published in peer-reviewed literature; method developments are overseen by senior responsible officers.
- Documentation, version control, and central storage of code are maintained; mass-balance checks ensure numerical consistency; outputs are compared with historical data.
- Data and method developments follow QA standards for government analytical models.

## Practical considerations and limitations

- The grid-average deposition is suitable for total deposition load (e.g., catchments) but not appropriate for habitat-specific deposition rates.
- Inter-annual weather variability can be high; rolling 3-year means help mitigate this.
- The most recent year’s outputs rely on the most recent meteorology with emissions from the previous year, due to data lags; emissions patterns change slowly, so this is not expected to greatly affect accuracy.
- Data sharing and metadata completeness can affect data usability; CBED includes extensive metadata and documentation to support data governance.
