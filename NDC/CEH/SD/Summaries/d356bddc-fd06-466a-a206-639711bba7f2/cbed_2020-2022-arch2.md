# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- Purpose and outputs
  - Produces 1x1 km gridded deposition data for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations.
  - Integrates measured gas/PM concentrations and precipitation ions with modelled ammonia patterns to estimate wet and dry deposition.
  - Wet deposition derived from annual precipitation maps; dry deposition from gas/PM concentrations and habitat-specific deposition velocities across land cover types (forest, moorland, fertilised grassland, arable, urban).
  - For each grid cell, a Grid Average deposition is calculated; habitat-specific deposition is used for critical load exceedance assessments (moorland/short vegetation vs forest).

- Data inputs and modelling
  - Nitric acid concentrations: interpolated from ~30 monitoring sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 concentrations: from the PCM model (interpolated rural measurements plus sources).
  - Ammonia concentrations: from EMEP4UK at 3x3 km resolution; UK NH3 emissions from NAEI at 1x1 km; non-UK emissions from CEIP at 0.1° resolution.
  - Emissions and meteorology: yearly EMEP4UK outputs driven by emissions data and meteorology; most recent year uses current meteorology with previous year’s emissions due to data lag.
  - Meteorology: WRF v4.4.2 with ERA-5 reanalysis (0.25°) and data assimilation.
  - Ammonia model calibration: linear regression against NAMN measurements; stations with at least 70% coverage used after outlier checks.
  - Orographic enhancement: applied to precipitation concentration in upland regions (Holme Moss and Great Dun Fell observations).
  - Inter-annual variability: deposition averaged over a three-year period to smooth variability; data are produced as rolling 3-year means.

- Deposition calculation and downscaling
  - Dry deposition: combines gas/PM concentrations with habitat-specific deposition velocities to compute deposition to each land cover type (forest, moorland, fertilised grassland, arable, urban).
  - Wet deposition: includes deposition from precipitation and occult deposition to vegetation (cloud droplets); mapped for sulphate, ammonium, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, and acidity.
  - Downscaling: 5x5 km outputs are bilinearly interpolated to 1x1 km grid resolution.
  - Habitat-specific application: critical load calculations apply moorland deposition values to non-woodland habitats and forest deposition values to woodland habitats.

- Data products and structure
  - Four 2020–2022 3-year mean CSV files:
    - CBED-deposition-moorland-2020-2022.csv (moorland deposition: NOx, NHx, NMS, NM_ca)
    - CBED-deposition-forest-2020-2022.csv (forest deposition: NOx_f, NHx_f, NMS_f, NM_ca_f)
    - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2020-2022.csv (grid-average deposition: NOx_ga, NHx_ga, NMS_ga, NM_ca_ga)
    - CBED-ammonia-conc-2020-2022.csv (ammonia concentration: nh3_c)
  - Each row includes easting and northing (metres, OS GB grid center) and deposition values in keq ha-1 year-1 for the relevant ecosystem type.
  - Deposition values expressed as kilo-equivalents per hectare per year (keq ha-1 year-1); conversion factors to kg units provided (S: x16; N: x14; Ca: x20).

- Units, conversions, and interpretation
  - All deposition values: keq ha-1 year-1.
  - Conversions:
    - Sulphur deposition to kg S ha-1 year-1: keq ha-1 year-1 × 16
    - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition to kg N ha-1 year-1: keq ha-1 year-1 × 14
    - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg) deposition to kg Ca ha-1 year-1: keq ha-1 year-1 × 20

- Quality control and validation
  - Extensive peer review and participation in Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
  - Methods published in peer-reviewed literature; development approved by senior officers.
  - Version control and central storage of code; mass balance checks to ensure numerical consistency with previous years.

- Temporal scope and data handling
  - Annual calculations, provided as rolling 3-year means to reduce inter-annual variability.
  - Two ecosystem types per grid cell: moorland and forest/woodland; grid-average values available for total deposition assessments (e.g., catchment scale).

- Accessibility and use
  - Data are stored for formal repository use and uploaded to appropriate data portals; underlying data inputs and methods support transparency and reuse by others.
