# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- A quality assurance (QA) exercise to quantify consistency and reliability of the CS2000 field programme.
- Conducted on 38 of 519 squares from the 1998 survey; in each square, one quarter was resurveyed.
- Assessed 234 plots across nine plot types to evaluate plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, cover estimates, landcover mapping, and recording of changes.
- Aimed to relate CS2000 QA findings to the CS1990 survey for cross-time consistency.

## Aims
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording and change statistics.
- Examine plot relocation efficiency and observer-related biases.
- Explain recording differences in terms of location, orientation, management, season, and plot type.
- Relate QA findings to CS1990 outcomes to gauge overall reliability of the CS2000 data.

## Methods (at a glance)
- Selected 38 squares (of 519); 234 plots recorded across seven main plot types (including quadrats and linear plots).
- Relocation tests used buried plates, original sketches, photographs, and metal detectors; assessed four relocation categories.
- Compared CS2000 survey data with QA reassessment to derive:
  - Species concordance and mis-matches
  - Vegetation cover differences
  - Landcover and boundary code concordance (primary and qualifying codes)
  - Change in landuse codes (between CS1990/CS2000 and QA)
- Used DECORANA ordination to evaluate directional bias in axis scores.
- Annexed data provide per-square efficiency and dates.

## Key Findings

### Plot Relocation
- Of 210 CS2000 plots, 86.7% were satisfactorily relocated; 60% accurately relocated, ~25% approximately relocated, ~15% inadequately relocated.
- QA assessors located 69.3% of plates; overall plate recovery across CS2000 vs 1991 CS1990 was ~40–45% (reflecting new/duplicate plates and locator challenges).
- Eight-year relocation challenges existed (difficulty with small 4 m habitat plots). Some relocation errors included placing plots on the wrong side of streams or hedges.
- Conclusion: ~60% of CS2000 plots were accurately relocated; ~25% reasonably relocated; ~15% poorly relocated. No single major bias identified, but relocation and plate-search practices varied.

### Species Concordance
- CS2000 mean species per plot: 17.9; QA mean: 20.4.
- 71% of CS2000 records were confirmed by QA; 2% non-concordance due to real management/seasonal changes.
- Overall initial recording efficiency ~73%, comparable to CS1990 QA when adjusted for plot relocation differences.
- Species mis-matches concentrated in grasses and certain genera (e.g., Poa, Agrostis, Rumex, Ranunculus, Stellaria); many instances of “overlooked” species and mis-identifications.
- Same assessors used across QA cycles; indicates similar search efficiency; seasonal effects influenced some differences.

### Vegetation Cover
- Visual cover estimates compared between CS2000 surveyors and QA assessors for principal species.
- Overall mean cover agreement varied by species; several grasses showed significant differences (e.g., Holcus lanatus and Dactylis glomerata had notable contrasts; Poa trivialis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Elymus repens showed variability).
- In general, grass-like species dominated cover-discrepancy signals; some broad agreements for other taxa were stronger.
- Informative finding: cover estimates were reasonably consistent but sensitive to species and timing.

### Landcover Mapping and Codes
- Landcover coding grouped into primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes.
- Agreement: Primary landcover codes ~88%; BAP (broad habitat) codes ~77%; overall primary landcover agreement ~87.5%.
- BAP mapping highlighted some boundary-delineation issues and boundary type misclassifications.
- Primary boundary features showed high concordance (~92% code concordance; ~85–89% overall).
- Hedge/hedge shape coding had limited success; some wall boundary codes varied (e.g., wall condition classifications varied between codes 306 vs 307 depending on regional conventions).
- Changes in landuse between CS1990 and CS2000 were inconsistently recorded; many changes observed in QA were not noted by CS2000, and some surveyor-recorded changes were not substantiated by QA assessors.

### Change Recording (CS1990/CS2000 vs QA)
- Overall change concordance: ~51.4%.
- Changes not noted by CS2000: ~33.9%.
- Changes noted but not substantiated by assessors: ~14.7%.
- If real changes were present but missed by QA, true concordance would be still under 60%.
- Tendency for CS2000 to retain original 1990 codes or omit new codes; some miscodings of hedges and boundaries observed.
- Conclusion: change detection reliability was limited; many real changes since 1990 may have been missed, underscoring the importance of careful change-capture in longitudinal surveys.

### Additional Mapping and Boundary Details
- Hedge textures, wall boundaries, and boundary heights were examined; overall mapping and boundary coding were robust but with notable discrepancies in hedge shapes and wall condition classifications.
- The QA emphasized maintaining consistent metadata on land features, with clear documentation of changes and the rationale for code changes.

## Data Quality and Bias Assessment
- Across plot types, there was no significant directional bias between CS2000 and QA axis scores; mean axis scores were not significantly different.
- No single factor (location, orientation, cover grading, etc.) emerged as the sole driver of discrepancies; multiple interacting sources (location/orientation errors, mis-recording of cover, and occasional mis-identifications) contributed.
- The QA demonstrated strong potential for data correction and improvement when QA feedback is integrated into field protocols and data coding practices.

## Implications for Data Leaders (Data Systems Perspective)
- The CS2000 QA demonstrates the value of rigorous QA to quantify data reliability, identify error sources, and guide improvements in data collection and coding standards.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Robust plot-marking and plate-based relocation to improve spatial reproducibility.
  - Clear, standardized coding schemes for landcover, boundaries, and hedge types, with explicit handling of changes.
  - Regular, staged QA checks to monitor observer performance, especially for complex plot types and boundary features.
  - Documentation of change as a separate, verifiable data stream, with explicit criteria for what constitutes a real change.
  - Metadata capture on observer identity, season, and plot conditions to enable bias and variance analyses.
- The exercise shows strong data discoverability potential if QA results, codes, and change logs are maintained with full provenance.

## Recommendations for Data Management and Governance
- Strengthen data governance around field codes and classifications:
  - Maintain a centralized, versioned codebook for primary, secondary, and cover codes; document any regional adaptations.
  - Include explicit change-tracking rules and audit trails for code updates.
- Improve data collection practices:
  - Use durable plot markers and standardized relocation protocols; consider dual-marking or GPS corroboration where feasible.
  - Deploy staged QA checks during field campaigns to reduce drift between survey and QA.
- Enhance change-detection workflows:
  - Implement a structured process for capture of change signals, with mandatory substantiation steps for any change code.
  - Include a reconciliation step between CS1990/CS2000 codes and QA assessments to minimize miscodings.
- Strengthen metadata and data discovery:
  - Publish QA metrics (e.g., relocation efficiency, species concordance, cover agreement, code concordance) alongside main datasets.
  - Maintain per-square efficiency tables (as Annex B showed) to enable users to gauge reliability by area.
- Plan for targeted follow-up:
  - For arable margin plots, consider a design with multiple visits across seasons to reduce misclassification risk.
  - Invest in targeted training for grasses and problematic taxa to improve identification and consistency.

## Annex (Dates and Efficiency)
- Dates and efficiency data are provided per square and plot type, illustrating varying levels of efficiency in CS2000 vs QA across different land classes (LC, LG, MA, UP) and new squares.
- These data underscore the practical variability encountered in large-scale field surveys and the value of per-square QA reporting for transparency and data use planning.
