# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and GIS relevance
  - Provides standardized, field-collected data for GIS-ready map products and time-series analysis.
  - Outputs are designed to integrate with OS 1:10,000 base maps, theme maps, and Broad Habitat (BAP) reporting frameworks for policy and biodiversity monitoring.
  - Data are organized to support both map-based (Mappable BAPs) and plot-based (Plottable BAPs) outputs, enabling policy-relevant spatial analysis.

- Sampling framework and scope
  - Builds on CS1990 with re-survey of existing squares and addition of new squares to represent new land classes; emphasis on standardization to minimize observer variation.
  - Approximately 508 re-surveyed squares plus additional squares; coordinated by ITE Research Stations; typical field effort per square around four days.
  - Linked time-series datasets to assess changes in land cover and landscapes.

- Data collection framework (FAB)
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) capture data across five themes and map to GIS-ready formats.
  - Two-tier mapping approach:
    - Mappable Broad Habitats (BAPs) for mapped changes in lowland/enclosed landscapes.
    - Plottable Broad Habitats (BAPs) for upland/unenclosed landscapes tracked via plots.
  - FAB pages record: physiography/inland water/coastal, agriculture/vegetation, forestry/woodland/trees, boundaries, buildings/structures/ recreation land; each page links to prior CS1990 codes.

- Plot types and field procedures
  - X PLOTS (large plots, 200 m²; nested subplots) for detailed vegetation recording; permanent markers; GPS/photography recommended.
  - Y PLOTS (2 m × 2 m; five per square) to establish baselines for vegetation change.
  - U PLOTS (2 m × 2 m; upland plottable habitats) to capture unenclosed vegetation changes.
  - B PLOTS (boundary plots; hedges/walls/fences) to sample adjacent boundaries.
  - A, H, D, S, W, R, V PLOTS for arable margins, hedgerows, hedgerow diversity, streamside/ waterside, roadsides/verges.
  - All plots record all species with cover estimates; precise positioning and orientation documented.

- Data quality, standardization, and workflows
  - Strong emphasis on standardized field procedures, training, and quality control to minimize observer variation.
  - Plot relocation via permanent markers and GPS; ground plans and aerial guidance used for GIS traceability.
  - Data linked to FABs and theme maps to enable reliable change detection and policy outputs.

- Permissions, access, and field logistics
  - Landowner consent required; formal letters precede visits; access confirmed on-site.
  - Survey teams carry ITE credentials; field logistics coordinated by station coordinators.

- Annexes and supplementary aspects
  - Annexes cover GPS data collection, pond datasets, species nomenclature, and specialized habitat/vegetation keys.
  - Ponds and pond-definition notes reference prior surveys for consistency.

- End-to-end GIS workflow
  - Prepare OS base maps and theme maps; link FAB pages to map features via parcel numbers.
  - Conduct field surveys in both old and new squares; map changes for old squares and features in new squares.
  - Organize outputs using Mappable vs Plottable BAPs; relate field codes to broad habitat classifications for policy outputs.
  - Relocate plots with permanent markers; capture GPS coordinates; photograph plots with reference features.
  - Compile data into GIS-ready databases and reports with traceability between new parcels, old parcels, and their codes.

- Section 10 – Sampling
  - Soil sampling
    - In each X-plot, three soil cores are collected per square using specified pipes; five replicate samples per 1 km square.
    - Samples analyzed for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status; processed at ITE Merlewood.
    - Detailed procedural steps cover point selection, coring, labelling, packaging, and posting of samples.
  - Calluna sampling
    - Collect current year growth (CYG) Calluna vulgaris shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) for nitrogen analyses to assess deposition impacts.
    - Randomized sampling from multiple plants; careful bagging and posting to ITE Merlewood.
  - Freshwater sampling
    - Conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff; scheduling coordinated with CS2000 field teams.

- Section 11 – Photography
  - One camera per team; use print film and stock; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position.
  - Include square/plot IDs on a prominent board; compose with reference features visible; avoid excessive sky in frames.
  - Photos provide verifiable spatial context for GIS mapping and field notes.

- Section 12 – Procedures after survey
  - Post-survey data checks to ensure no features are omitted; avoid re-transcribing data unless necessary.
  - Transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly for processing and archival.

- Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data
  - Guidelines for ensuring adequate satellite visibility (minimum four satellites; PDOP < 6 preferred).
  - Distinctions between stationary (plot location) and moving (boundary) recording.
  - File naming conventions to ensure GIS traceability (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4).
  - Logging controls, data rate, and procedures for starting/stopping logging; navigation of equipment and error handling.
  - Battery management, almanac updates, and obstruction mitigation (e.g., elevating the antenna to improve reception).
  - Attribute reference sheets assist quick entry of plot IDs and features for GIS integration.

- Equipment and distribution
  - Standard field equipment and items distributed to teams; organization of envelopes, pipes, and sample packaging for lab submission.
