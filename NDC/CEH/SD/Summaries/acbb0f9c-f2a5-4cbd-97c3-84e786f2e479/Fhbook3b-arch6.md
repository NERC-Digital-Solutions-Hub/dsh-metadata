# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- A comprehensive guide for updating Britain’s land-use, land-cover, and vegetation data as part of the Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000), building on CS1977/1984/1990 to enable time-series analysis and cross-temporal comparability.
- Emphasises standardisation to minimise observer variation and to align data with CS1990 for robust change detection.

## Data collection scope and sampling framework

- Conducted across Britain in 1 km square units, re-surveying core CS1990 squares and adding new squares for country-specific estimates and new land-class representation.
- Three main data streams:
  - Soil sampling (CS2000 field surveyors): five replicate soil samples per square for chemistry, fauna, and microbiology; processed at ITE Merlewood.
  - Calluna sampling (soil-plant interaction focus): current year’s Calluna vulgaris growth collected (30–50 g fresh weight) to study foliar nitrogen and deposition effects.
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff in coordination with CS2000 teams).
- Plot types (nine variants) define sampling geometry and vegetation recording:
  - X PLOTS (200 m2 with nested 4 m2 subplots)
  - Y PLOTS (2 m × 2 m)
  - U PLOTS (2 m × 2 m, unenclosed habitats)
  - B PLOTS (200 m2 at field boundaries)
  - A PLOTS (arable field margins, up to 5 per square)
  - H PLOTS (hedgerows, 10 m)
  - D PLOTS (hedgerow diversity, 30 m)
  - S & W PLOTS (streamside and waterside, linear)
  - R & V PLOTS (roadsides and verges, linear)

## Planning, relocation, and data integrity

- Location and relocation procedures ensure repeatability with:
  - Plate markers, GPS, and photographs to relocate old and new squares accurately.
  - Permanent markers and mapped plant communities with standardized nested plots.
- Parcel-based change management for time-series consistency:
  - New Parcel Numbers enable renumbering or creation of new features when changes occur.
  - Processes for no change, minor code changes, and major changes (splits/merges) to keep theme maps and data forms aligned.

## Data collection and recording standards

- Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) are the core data-recording package per square, combining maps and coded data.
- Vegetation data:
  - Presence/absence and percent cover for up to 200 common species; unlisted species recorded by Latin names.
  - Bryophytes/lichens recorded from restricted lists with defined cover values.
  - 5 dominant codes per mosaic; combinations used for complex vegetation.
  - Special keys for taxa such as bracken, mosses, calcareous/acid grasslands; aims for CS1990 comparability.
- Linkage between field data and maps is preserved through clear parcel, code, and description linkages (parcel numbers, CS1990 codes, primary codes, and BAP translations).

## Mapping framework and coding systems

- Three mapping approaches to balance old and new survey areas:
  - Old squares mapped with CS1990 codes; new squares mapped de novo.
  - Broad Habitat (BAP) framework for widespread habitats; uplands mapped with Plottable/Broad Habitats plus additional plots.
  - Plottable vs. Mappable Broad Habitats: upland unenclosed areas use broader plot-based approaches due to boundary complexity.
- Output products:
  - OS 1:10,000 base maps
  - Thematic maps: Physiography, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Forestry/Trees, Boundaries, Buildings/Communications/Recreation
  - BAP maps
- Data-recording forms maintain explicit linkages between map features and coded descriptions (parcels, CS1990 codes, primary codes, and BAP translations).

## Data collection workflow: field procedures

- Ground-truth and data collection occur within 1 km squares (old CS1990 squares retained where possible).
- Detailed procedures for new square mapping, cross-referencing with aerial photographs, and guidance for resolving feature mosaics and boundaries.
- Mapping new squares uses standard data codes for areas, lines, and points; contingency handling for conflicts with aerial imagery.

## Plot-level sampling and vegetation recording details

- Plot locations and relocation are documented with precise coordinates and reference features.
- Standardised vegetation recording across plots includes:
  - Plot sketches and measurement data
  - Systematic recording of species presence/absence and cover
  - Use of predefined coding schemes to ensure cross-square comparability with CS1990 data

## GPS, photography, and data capture annexes

- Annex 1: guidance for collecting GPS data, including battery checks, satellite visibility (PDOP), file naming conventions, and log procedures.
- Photography section:
  - One camera per team; photographs of every vegetation plot with reference features.
  - Photographs must show square/plot numbers on a visible board; reference features should be obvious and permanent.
  - Composition guidelines to ensure future usability under varying conditions.

## Post-survey procedures and data management

- End-of-day checks to ensure no features are omitted; avoid transposing data unless absolutely necessary.
- FABs and samples are transported to ITE Stations promptly for processing and storage.
- Documentation supports integration with later analyses and policy applications, including potential links to top-down remote sensing for enhanced ground-truthing.

## Annexed guidance and data integrity notes

- Collecting GPS data requires attention to battery life, satellite availability, PDOP, and file naming to maintain traceability.
- The attribute reference/sheet provides quick access to plot identifiers for efficient GPS data entry.
- Documentation acknowledges atypical field circumstances and emphasizes thorough qualitative notes to accompany data entries.
