# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Aims of QA: quantify accuracy of CS2000 field recording, assess plot relocation efficiency, explain observer effects, and relate findings to CS1990/CS2000 changes; evaluate mapping and boundary coding.
- Scope: 38 of 519 squares sampled; one quarter of each square resurveyed (234 species plots across 9 plot types); comparison between CS2000 field survey and QA assessment.

## Methods and Scope

- Sample and plots:
  - CS2000: 170 plots analyzed for relocation/recording.
  - QA: 210 plots assessed (including 38 squares; many CS2000 squares repeated).
- Plot relocation and plate location:
  - Attempted relocation of buried plates marking quadrats; evaluation of plate and plot relocation success.
- Data types evaluated:
  - Species presence/absence and percentage cover for principal species.
  - Landcover mapping using primary, secondary, and cover codes; boundary feature coding; hedge/wall conditions.
  - Change in landcover codes since 1990; hedge/wall boundary changes.
- Analytical approaches:
  - DECORANA ordination to assess directionality of changes.
  - Concordance and efficiency metrics to compare CS2000 vs QA outputs.
  - Tabular comparisons by plot type, landclass, and code group.

## Key Findings

- Plot relocation and plate recovery
  - Plot relocation recovery: 86.7% of full searches successfully relocated; ~60% accurately relocated; ~25% relocated with approximate accuracy; ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - Plate/plot recovery: QA located 69.3% of plates (vs. 65.2% in CS1990 QA); overall, relocation of eight years on is feasible, but CS2000 search performance varied.
  - 60% accurate relocation, 25% more or less relocated, ~15% poorly relocated; some relocations mislocated relative to features (e.g., road verges, hedges).
- Species concordance and recording accuracy
  - 71% of CS2000 records were confirmed as present by QA; ~2% non-concordances due to real management/seasonal changes.
  - Estimated initial field recording accuracy around 73%; approximately 5% of discrepancy attributed to plot location errors.
  - Between 1990 CS and 1998 CS2000 QA, improved agreement in several cover estimates but persistent mis-matches among grasses and some forbs.
- Vegetation cover and key species
  - Comparison of cover for 30 most frequent species showed six species with significantly different cover levels between CS2000 and QA; some differences likely seasonal.
  - Overall cover agreement for principal species around 74%; some species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Elymus repens) showed significant disparities.
  - Fine-scale discrepancies often linked to plot location/orientation and judgments of cover rather than species identity alone.
- Change in vegetation and axis scores
  - DECORANA analysis: overall axis shift between CS2000 and QA was insignificant; no directional bias detected when grouped by plot type and landclass.
  - Mean axis scores: CS2000 = 387.8; QA = 392.0; no significant difference (ANOVA, Bartlett p = 0.847).
  - Plot-type and landclass variation: no consistent directional bias across landclasses.
- Landcover mapping and codes
  - Primary landcover code concordance: 88% (concordance); primary boundary codes 85%; BAP (broad habitat) concordance 77%; overall primary landcover agreement 87.5% (higher than CS1990).
  - Boundary features: high agreement for boundary codes overall; stockproof boundary assessment around 74–76% depending on measure; boundary height coding performed well (around 89–92% code concordance).
  - Hedge/wall coding: moderate concordance (around 67.5%); omissions contributed notably to mismatches.
- Change in landuse and boundaries
  - Change concordance: overall ~51.4% agreement; ~33.9% of changes not noted by CS2000; ~14.7% changes recorded but not substantiated by QA.
  - A notable portion of change detected by CS2000 was not corroborated by QA; many changes appeared to be miscodings or omissions rather than real landscape change.
- Hedge diversity and arable plots
  - Hedge diversity (19 samples): total species recorded 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%; mean species per hedge plot 5.89 (QA higher than CS2000).
  - Arable margin plots (limited data): five plots; overall agreement around 30.6%; high seasonal variability and field-plot familiarity issues; several misidentifications in ruderal species.
- Arable plots and seasonal effects
  - Arable margins showed substantial seasonal variability; many mis-matches linked to season, unfamiliarity with ruderal species, and boundary changes.
  
## Data Quality Metrics (Overall)

- Species data
  - Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4; QA generated longer species lists (approx. 13–14% increase over CS2000).
  - Species concordance (TI vs T2): 73% initial concordance when accounting for plot location differences; 2% real change between times.
- Cover estimates
  - Overall cover concordance for principal species ≈ 74%; several species showed significant cover differences; some agreements improved vs. earlier QA cycles.
  - Species cover coding concordance around 74%; higher when omitting rare/discrepant notes; high 89% concordance when both CS2000 and QA used the same code strings but with omissions considered.
- Landcover and boundaries
  - Primary landcover concordance ≈ 88%; overall primary landcover agreement ≈ 87.5%; BAP concordance ≈ 77%.
  - Primary boundary code concordance ≈ 92%; overall boundary features concordance ≈ 85%; hedge-wall boundary discrepancies more common in hedges (67.5%).
- Change concordance
  - Overall change concurrence ≈ 51.4%; a substantial portion of changes observed by CS2000 not substantiated by QA; reliance on plot data for change evaluation emphasized due to high misclassification risk in coding changes.
  
## Implications for Data Use

- Data robustness:
  - CS2000 data are broadly reliable for mapping and change detection, but care is needed in interpreting changes due to under-recorded or misclassified changes.
  - High-quality mapping codes and boundary data generally dependable; boundary-height and stockproof status are strong, while hedge-type coding benefited from improved codes but still shows omissions.
- Location and orientation sensitivity:
  - Plot relocation and orientation errors contribute significantly to non-concordances; accurate plot placement remains a critical factor for data quality.
- Seasonality and species identification:
  - Seasonal effects influence species presence/absence and cover; arable margins particularly affected; extensive identification of grasses and some forbs remains challenging in vegetative states.
- Change analysis caution:
  - Given the low overall change concordance, future analyses should emphasize robust field validation and consider multiple visits for certain plot types (notably arable margins).

## Practical Takeaways for Data Support

- Emphasize improved plot location/orientation accuracy in field protocols and data entry.
- Maintain robust plate/plot recovery strategies and consider permanent markers to improve relocation in follow-up surveys.
- Enhance training and reference materials for grass and ruderal species to reduce mis-identifications.
- Use multiple field visits for arable margins to better capture seasonal change and reduce mis-matches.
- Continue systematic mapping verification, with particular attention to hedge and boundary coding and to the interpretation of boundary changes.
- Treat change data with caution; distinguish real landscape change from coding omissions or miscodings, and consider cross-validation with supplementary data sources.
