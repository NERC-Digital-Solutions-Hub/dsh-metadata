# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Document describes the field survey sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year development of the ITE Land Classification.
  - Emphasises that understanding the full methodological lineage is essential to interpret time-series results.

- Core concepts: stratified sampling and land classification
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure samples represent the population and reduce bias.
  - ITE Land Classification groups land into classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to create strata for sampling.
  - Early approach used a 1 km square sample; sampling units and classes underpin national, regional, and country-specific estimates.
  - Classification and sampling decisions have historically evolved with computing power and data availability.

- Early development and Key methods
  - 1978: First large-scale GB survey used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on environmental data to define 32 Land Classes from 1,228 centre squares (plus surrounding squares) and surveyed 256 squares (8 per class).
  - 1984: Second field survey expanded to 384 squares (12 per class) but still based on the original Land Classification; aims shifted toward land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping.
  - 1990 (CS1990): All GB squares classified using a revised Land Classification; 508 squares surveyed; linked with first Land Cover Map from satellite data.
  - 1990 framework highlighted need for regional/local estimates and planning for broader geographic coverage.

- Developments leading to CS2000
  - Recognition that some classes were under-represented in the newer classification; steps were taken to re-balance sampling.
  - Separate country estimates were introduced to allow reporting for England & Wales together and Scotland separately, affecting class subdivision and aggregation.
  - Changes included subdividing Land Classes into country-unit versions, adjusting class counts (to 40), adding new squares (including 19 for England & Wales balance, and extra to maintain representation across new classes), and targeted upland habitat sampling.

- Wales-focused updates and England/Scotland considerations (CS2007)
  - Post-devolution, Wales required Wales-only reporting, necessitating further adjustments.
  - Welsh-specific class subdivisions created five new Welsh classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional sample squares to ensure adequate representation (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class); some English classes were slightly reduced to maintain balance.
  - An uplands module added to CS2000/CS2007 sampling to improve accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
  - England adjustments did not necessarily add English squares proportionally and some classes in England had as few as 4 squares.

- Survey design and outputs
  - Tables and maps outline how many sample squares were allocated per class and per country across surveys (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - Emphasizes the need to maintain consistency in national estimates when using different Land Classifications; recommends using the latest classification for country estimates while understanding historical classifications for cross-survey comparability.
  - Outputs include main country reports and national summaries (e.g., Countryside Survey 1990, 2000, 2007 reports).

- Data governance and management implications for data leaders
  - Changes in classification impact national estimates; clear documentation of classification versions and their geographic applicability is essential.
  - Historical time-series require careful handling of class definitions and sampling frames to maintain comparability.
  - The approach demonstrates robust data governance: documented lineage, explicit stratification logic, and transparent updates to accommodate policy needs (e.g., Wales-only reporting).
