# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides guidelines for the CS2000 field survey to update land-use and landscape datasets, monitor changes, and support policy and biodiversity objectives.
  - Builds on CS1990 with enhanced data capture, standardization, and time-series consistency.
  - Aims to link field data with policy frameworks (biodiversity, sustainable development) and to combine ground-truth data with remote sensing for landscape-wide understanding.

- Data standards, coding, and governance
  - Extensive standardized coding for taxa across Ferns, Forbs/Woody Species, Mosses/Lichens, etc., illustrating the need for a centralized, consistent data dictionary.
  - Emphasis on minimizing new, surveyor-created codes; clearly document translations between CS1990 and CS2000 codes.
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) consolidates data recording forms and mapping; strict, neat completion required.
  - Aerial photography conventions (API) guide field usage, but ground truth remains authoritative; codes and boundaries standardized.
  - Importance of provenance, metadata, and traceability for long-running time-series datasets; procedures to reconcile changes across CS1990 and CS2000.

- Sampling design and core data elements
  - Core sampling framework: three data elements — mapping, plots (vegetation and soils), and sampling events.
  - Mapping approaches: two modes for change detection
    - Mappable Broad Habitats (lowland/enclosed landscapes) using CS1990-style codes with added plot data.
    - Plottable Broad Habitats (upland/unenclosed landscapes) where changes are monitored via plots rather than exact map changes.
  - Broad habitat reporting to align with biodiversity action plan needs; emphasis on standardization and comparability across time and space.
  - Time-series goals: maintain re-surveys of established squares while adding new squares to reflect changing distributions; CS2000 expands coverage to strengthen representation.

- Plot design and vegetation sampling
  - Plot types and roles
    - Areal plots (large 200 m2)
    - Nested plots (4 m2 core)
    - Y plots (small plots across land-cover types)
    - X plots (Wally plots): five large 200 m2 plots per square for baseline and change monitoring
    - U plots: unenclosed plots in plottable broad habitats
    - B plots: boundary plots for perimeter habitat changes
    - A plots: arable field margin plots
    - H plots: hedgerow plots for woody vegetation
    - D plots: hedgerow diversity plots
    - S/W plots: streamside/waterside vegetation
    - R/V plots: roadside/verges vegetation
  - Plot relocation and permanent marking with standardized procedures (metal plates, GPS where possible) and clear relocation rules for old vs new squares.
  - Standardized data collection practices to support long-term comparability and cross-square aggregation.

- Field governance, access, and permissions
  - Access to all square components requires landowner permission; advance notices and on-site verification to minimize wasted effort.
  - Clear procedures for partial or complete access refusal, with guidance for handling old vs new squares and vegetation plots.
  - Ownership and landowner information captured to support context, engagement, and future data collection.

- Data quality, standardization, and training
  - Strong emphasis on standardizing observer technique and incorporating quality control throughout CS2000.
  - Training and references to Field Handbook definitions are essential prerequisites to ensure data reliability.
  - Procedures to identify genuine changes vs recording errors and to reconcile discrepancies between CS1990 and CS2000 datasets.

- Data management, outputs, and policy integration
  - Data designed to support national datasets, policy planning, and biodiversity action plans; pathways to translate field codes into broad habitat maps and monitor trends over time.
  - Framework supports linking top-down remote-sensing outputs with bottom-up field data to validate and calibrate satellite-derived maps.
  - Annexes provide templates and references to ensure consistent data recording, mapping, and GIS compatibility.

- Section 10: Sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater)
  - Three sampling types: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, freshwater biota sampling; freshwater sampling conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE).
  - Background: CS2000 builds a national, spatially referenced soil dataset to support soil quality indices and baseline standards; sampling follows the 1978 square framework for representativeness.
  - Soil sampling protocol (in each square, within X-plots)
    - Five replicate soil samples per square; three cores per sample (two short, one long) sent to Merlewood for processing.
    - Spatial arrangement: samples taken at center plot of each X-plot (three offsets: north, east, west, each 15 cm from the center point).
    - Packaging and transport: sealed bags, labeled envelopes, and post as required; urgency for short-lived samples (soil fauna and microbiology) to be processed quickly.
  - Equipment distribution and field logistics: specified packing lists and per-square allocation; attention to timing, labeling, and transport of samples.
  - Calluna sampling: collect CYG (current year growth) shoots from Calluna vulgaris; 30–50 g fresh weight per sample; careful drying and packing; dispatch according to survey schedule.
  - Freshwater sampling: coordinated with IFE to avoid conflicts and ensure synchronized sampling windows.
  
- Section 11: Photography
  - One camera per team; use print film to photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and landmark references.
  - Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and within frame; include square and plot identifiers on a board visible in photos.
  - Photographs should balance plot coverage and reference visibility; minimize sky in frame; training examples provided.

- Section 12: Procedures after survey
  - Post-survey data checks: review data sheets to ensure no features are omitted.
  - Re-transcription of data into new maps/forms is discouraged and only used if original materials are damaged.
  - Arrangements to transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations should be made promptly.

- Annex 1: Collecting GPS data
  - Steps for satellite readiness, stationary vs moving feature recording, and file naming conventions.
  - Each plot/feature requires its own data file named to reflect square and plot (e.g., 501X4.PSE); guidelines for adding new feature references (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
  - Data logging controls, sampling rates, and attributes to capture; PDOP guidance (<6 is good for 3D fixes).
  - Troubleshooting tips (obstructions, antenna extension, battery management) and usage notes for the Magellan keypad.
  - Recording stationary plot locations requires a clear sky view for 3–5 minutes; guidance on best practices for GPS logging.

- Appendix: Attribute references and mapping
  - Detailed attribute reference and mapping schemes to streamline quick input of plot identifiers and associated features.
  - Reference sheets provide shortcuts to rapidly access specific plots or feature identifiers (e.g., D1, X1, Y5, etc.).

- Practical takeaways for data leadership and strategy
  - Build and maintain a centralized, authoritative data dictionary for taxa and habitats to ensure consistent coding across teams and time.
  - Design data models that capture multiple data streams (mapping, plots, sampling) with clear provenance and traceability.
  - Implement standardized field workflows, rigorous QA, and comprehensive training to minimize observer variability in long-running time-series datasets.
  - Integrate field data with GIS and remote-sensing outputs to enable scalable, policy-relevant analyses and robust ground-truth validation.
  - Ensure robust data sharing, transparency, and documentation of coding decisions, methodological changes, and data lineage.
  - Plan for end-to-end data management: from field collection (GPS, photos, samples) through to central repositories, metadata, and policy-ready outputs.
