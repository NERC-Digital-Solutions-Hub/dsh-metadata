# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose and scope
  - QA exercise to assess consistency and reliability of the Countryside 2000 field programme due to multiple recorders and surveyors.
  - Sample: 38 of 519 squares from CS1998; resurvey of one quarter per square; 234 vegetation plots across nine plot types.
  - Aims: quantify field-recording accuracy and change statistics; assess plot relocation efficiency; explain recording differences (observer error, location/orientation, management, season); relate findings to CS1990/CS1998 benchmarks; evaluate data quality for monitoring and policy decision-making.

- Methods and scope
  - Selection and resurvey protocol described in Annexes; 34 of the 38 squares had CS1990 counterparts; includes plots types: quadrats, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, etc.
  - Plate-based relocation: buried metal plates used to locate plot corners; assessment compared CS2000 relocation against QA findings eight years on.
  - Data items: plot location, land cover mapping, boundary features, and changes since 1990; primary and descriptive landcover codes; hedge and boundary codes; vegetation cover estimates.

- Key findings

  - Plot relocation efficiency
    - 60% of CS2000 plots accurately relocated by surveyors; ~25% relocated approximately; ~15% inadequately relocated.
    - QA assessors located 69.3% of plates; overall recovery comparable to 1991 QA (65.2%), indicating eight-year relocation feasibility.
    - For CS2000, many relocated plots were mispositioned (e.g., wrong boundary side, wrong bank of a stream); some plots required new plates, complicating future resurvey.

  - Species concordance and recording accuracy
    - Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9; QA 20.4; high level of agreement (roughly 71% concordance), with ~2% additional changes due to management/season.
    - Overall efficiency of species recording (TI vs T2) and mis-matches analyzed by type (mis-ID couplet, mis-ID no couplet, wrong box, overlooked, orientation, etc.).
    - Main sources of non-concordance: location/orientation errors and overlooked species; seasonal effects also contributed to differences.
    - Cover estimates: several species showed significant cover differences between CS2000 and QA (e.g., Holcus lanatus; Dactylis glomerata; Anthoxanthum odoratum), but many species showed non-significant differences. Overall cover concordance by species reached about 74%; some under- or overestimation observed in grass-dominated swards.
    - Change assessment across plots: axis-based ordination (DECORANA) indicated no systematic directional bias between CS2000 and QA; mean axis scores not significantly different (no directional bias; p = 0.847). However, 51.4% of recorded changes were concordant between time-one and time-two, with 33.9% not noted by CS2000 and 14.7% noted but not substantiated by assessors, suggesting substantial under-recording of change.

  - Landcover mapping and boundary coding
    - Primary landcover code concordance CS2000 vs QA: 87.5% overall (excluding BAP codes); BAP concordance 77.4%; including BAP codes, primary landcover agreement remained strong at 87.5%.
    - Overall agreement for primary boundary features: high (Total concordance 85.0%; code concordance 92.0%); most common boundary discrepancy involved hedge types (code 323: mixed hedge).
    - Hedge and wall coding: boundary shapes and hedge-related codes showed lower concordance (67.5%); some mis-match attributed to new codes (374–380) and differences in codifying hedge vs boundary features.
    - Boundary height and stockproofness: high efficiency in recording boundary height (74.3%–75.6% agreement) and stockproofness (83.8%–89.4% code concordance).

  - Hedge diversity and arable margins
    - Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species 124; common species 92; overall concordance 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%; hedge data tended to be treated as optional, leading to some overlooked woody species.
    - Arable margin plots (five plots): very limited data; concordance extremely poor, largely attributed to seasonal variation and lesser familiarity with ruderal species; recommendation for at least two visits to arable margins in future.

  - General change and monitoring implications
    - Change detection contributed modestly to overall data quality; substantial under-recording of changes since 1990 suggests that future monitoring should rely more on plot-based change data and ensure robust documentation of changes.

- Annexes and protocol highlights

  - QA methodology and scoring
    - Detailed categorization of relocation success (plate and plot), TI/T2 variation types (mis-ID, overlooked, orientation, incorrect location, management changes, etc.), and the treatment of changes.
    - Annex B presents timing and efficiency metrics across squares; Annex A outlines QA procedures and measurement approaches.
  - Data coding and mapping conventions
    - Use of primary land cover codes, land use qualifiers, boundary codes, and hedge/wall condition codes; emphasis on maintaining metadata, standardization, and alignment with CS2000 protocols.
  - Change and mapping monitoring guidance
    - Emphasis on documenting broad habitat changes, refined land cover changes, and boundary modifications; cautions about distinguishing real change from re-coding or mis-location errors.

- Implications for monitoring and policy

  - Strengths
    - High concordance in landcover mapping and boundary coding indicates robust data collection and clear coding protocols.
    - Landcover and boundary datasets demonstrate reliable comparability with prior surveys and QA exercises.
  - Challenges
    - Plot relocation and plot-location/orientation errors remain a significant source of mismatch, affecting species concordance and change statistics.
    - Change detection performance is limited; considerable under-recording of true changes implies the need for stronger emphasis on explicit change capture, possibly via repeated visits or enhanced field protocols.
    - Data sharing and metadata quality are crucial; addressing data governance, access, and comprehensive metadata would support better reuse for monitoring and policymaking.
  - Recommendations
    - Maintain and improve plate-based relocation methods and documentation to facilitate future re-surveys.
    - Improve training and field protocols to reduce mis-location/orientation errors and improve consistent recording of species and cover.
    - Increase frequency and coverage for arable margin plots or adapt sampling to account for strong seasonal effects.
    - Strengthen data governance, metadata completeness, and sharing of underlying data to enhance transparency and policy utility.

- Overall takeaway for monitoring frameworks
  - The CS2000 QA demonstrates the importance of rigorous, structured QA to quantify data reliability across location, identification, and change measurements.
  - Mapping and boundary coding tend to be robust, while change detection and fine-scale species recording are more susceptible to observer and location-related errors.
  - For policy-informing monitoring, prioritize clear error taxonomy, robust relocation strategies, and governance around metadata and data sharing to reduce silos and barriers.
