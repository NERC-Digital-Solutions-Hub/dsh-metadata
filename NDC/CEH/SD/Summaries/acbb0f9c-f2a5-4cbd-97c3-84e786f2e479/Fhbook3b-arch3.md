# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Detailed methodologies for large-scale field monitoring across England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man.
- Covers soil sampling, Calluna (heather) foliar sampling, freshwater biota sampling, photography, post-field procedures, and GPS data collection.
- Aims to provide baseline, spatially referenced data to support soil sustainability assessments, vegetation surveys, and policy-relevant evaluation.

## Monitoring design and data structures
- Three main sampling streams: soil chemistry/diversity, Calluna foliar nitrogen, and freshwater biota; freshwater sampling coordinated by Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff.
- Soil sampling targets five replicates per 1 km square, drawn from the same squares used in earlier surveys for continuity.
- Plot-based data capture uses standardized FABs (Field Activity Books) and a structured plot system (X-, Y-, U-, B-, A-, H-, D-, S/W-, R/V-plots) to quantify vegetation, habitat, and boundaries.
- Data integration emphasizes standardized codes, metadata, and linkage between themes (physiography, vegetation, boundaries, buildings, recreation, etc.).

## Soil sampling protocol
- Purpose: establish baseline soil quality metrics (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status.
- In each 1 km square, five replicate soil samples are collected from each X-plot center using three cores (two short white pipes and one long black pipe).
- Samples prepared and sent to ITE Merlewood for processing; rapid processing of the two shortest cores due to short shelf-life.
- Sampling locations are standardized relative to the center plot: 15 cm north, 15 cm east, and 15 cm west of the centre, all within the 2 x 2 m plot.
- Documentation and packaging requirements include labeled envelopes, specific pipe lengths, and post/posting procedures for timely transit.

## Calluna sampling protocol
- Objective: assess foliar nitrogen concentrations to infer potential nitrogen deposition impacts against defined critical loads.
- In every square containing Calluna vulgaris, collect current year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants, randomised selection, and label samples clearly.
- If samples are wet, allow partial drying before sealing; use addressed envelopes for mailing to ITE Merlewood.
- Samples despatched either from a research station or posted directly, with receipts retained for T&S (travel and subsistence) claims.

## Freshwater sampling coordination
- Freshwater sampling conducted by accredited IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 field surveyors.
- Scheduling arranged to avoid conflicts with field teams; ensures synchronized data collection across domains.

## Photography and field records
- One camera per field team; photography of every vegetation plot to document appearance and spatial context.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and clearly visible in photos; each image must display square/plot identifiers on a board placed at the plot edge.
- Photos should concentrate on vegetation and reference features, with limited sky to avoid light-reading interference; training materials illustrate proper/ improper setups.

## Procedures after survey
- Daily data review to ensure completeness; avoid transcribing data to new maps unless absolutely necessary.
- Arrange prompt transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations for processing and storage.

## GPS data collection and annexed guidance
- Annex 1 provides detailed GPS data collection procedures to ensure precise plot and feature geolocation.
- Steps include validating satellite availability (minimum four satellites, PDOP ideally below 6), choosing stationary vs moving data collection modes, and creating explicit file names (e.g., 501X4.PSE) tying square numbers to plot IDs.
- File naming conventions differentiate standard plots from newly recorded features (e.g., 501F1.MOB for a new feature).
- Data logging controls cover start/stop procedures, sampling rate, and immediate handling of data to preserve accuracy.
- Guidance on managing PDOP, obstructions, equipment use (Magellan keypad), and accumulating stationary position data for plot locations.

## Equipment, data handling and distribution
- Equipment lists include specialized soil sampling pipes, trowels, aluminum plates, and basic field gear; certain items distributed via regional coordinators (denoted by asterisks and hashes) to match square allocations.
- FABs and envelopes are prepared to streamline sample transport to ITE Merlewood, with corresponding plot and square identifiers clearly recorded.
- Data integrity emphasized through standardized coding, consistent observer input, photographic records, and rigorous plotting accuracy.

## Plot types and coding (summary)
- Plot types used to capture landscape and habitat variation:
  - X PLOTS (Areals): large plots centered on stock for vegetation
  - Y PLOTS (Small/Habitat): smaller plots across habitat types
  - U PLOTS (Unenclosed): plots for unenclosed habitat variation
  - B PLOTS (Boundary): plots at field boundaries
  - A PLOTS (Arable Field Margin): plots along arable margins
  - H PLOTS (Hedgerow): hedgerow plots
  - D PLOTS (Hedgerow Diversity): longer hedgerow transects
  - S & W PLOTS (Streamside/Waterside): linear plots along water bodies
  - R & V PLOTS (Roadside/Verge): plots along roads and verges
- These plots feed into a comprehensive data capture system with cross-referenced maps, forms, and parcel codes to support change detection and biodiversity assessments.
