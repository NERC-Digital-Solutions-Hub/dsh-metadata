# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- A field guide for Countryside Survey 2000 data update, expanding the 1990 programme with time-series focus, policy alignment (biodiversity, sustainable development), and standardized data capture across 1 km squares.

## Data scope and outputs
- Three sampling domains:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling ( conducted by IFE staff)
- Core outputs and records:
  - Field Assessment Books (FABs)
  - Vegetation plots data
  - Broad Habitat (BAP) maps and related reporting
  - Time-series capability through standardized methods and cross-year comparability
- Photography as a data product to document plots and context.

## Data model, standards, and metadata
- Field data captured on FABs using structured mappings, with species codes and habitat classifications.
- Coding schemes include vegetation, land cover, boundaries, and uses; unique parcel and alpha-prefix identifiers to manage changes across CS1990/CS2000.
- Emphasis on traceability between maps, FABs, plots, and metadata; GPS-enabled data linked to plots for robust georeferencing.
- Annexed guidance (Annex 1) formalizes GPS data collection for repeatable location reference.

## Planning, sampling, and governance
- Sampling plan structured around six ITE stations with square assignments; typical field cycle ~4 days per square.
- Re-sampling strategy for core squares to maintain time-series continuity; expanded square set and upland site proposals in CS2000.
- Permissions and provenance: landowner consent required; documented refusals and contingencies (relocation or abandonment).

## Field procedures and data collection
- Three square types:
  - Old squares (repeat measurements)
  - New squares (de novo mapping)
- Fieldwork components:
  - Mapping and boundaries: annotated 1:10,000 maps with standard and optional codes; focus on changes and broad habitat classes
  - FABs consolidate field sheets, maps, and codes; recording of boundaries, vegetation, land use, and features
  - Plots: multiple plot types for habitat sampling; permanent markers where feasible
  - Vegetation data: standardized forms; nested plot structure; GPS relocation for upland plots
- Aerial photography and API conventions used to support ground-truthing; reconciliation with field observations.

## Data quality, standardization, and change management
- Minimize observer variation through robust training and a comprehensive Field Handbook.
- Change detection in CS2000 differentiates old vs. new squares and Mappable vs. Plottable Broad Habitats; detailed FABs documentation and cross-referencing with CS1990 data.
- Re-location practices and renumbering rules to preserve data lineage; explicit procedures for handling split/relocated features.

## Data management, storage, and accessibility
- Core data organization around FABs, theme maps, and BAP maps with square-level traceability.
- Comprehensive metadata requirements: square identifiers, dates, surveyors, ownership/access details; owner information sheets accompany field data.
- GPS data collection Annex supports geospatial rigor and future re-use; emphasis on versioning and long-term accessibility of field data products.

## Design, mapping, and reporting considerations
- Mapping approach accommodates landscape changes: full inventories in new squares; change-focused recording in old squares.
- Rich boundary and feature coding (hedges, walls, fences, banks, verges) to support boundary change analysis and urban-rural delineation.
- Data products tailored to national reporting and biodiversity policy objectives with clear code mappings from CS1990 onward.

## Challenges and issues
- Incomplete understanding of user needs for some products.
- Timely receipt of field data and metadata completeness.
- Interoperability across diverse systems and legacy databases; maintaining coherent time-series.
- Handling large data volumes, complex codes, and accurate change attribution.

## Annexes and supplementary materials
- Annex 1: GPS data collection guidelines (field location and relocation)
- Comprehensive codification schemes for vegetation, land cover, boundaries, and land use
- Detailed field plotting, recording, and vegetation/bryophyte data procedures
- Attribute reference lists and reference sheets to streamline data entry

## Key governance takeaways for data stewards
- Enforce standardized field procedures, coding schemes, and FAB formats to ensure data quality and comparability over time.
- Maintain provenance and change-tracking mechanisms (parcel numbers, alpha-prefix changes, cross-references to CS1990).
- Ensure complete metadata and clear data lineage for all field data products.
- Align outputs with biodiversity and statutory policy frameworks via consistent mapping (e.g., Broad Habitats).
- Plan for data longevity and accessibility, including versioned datasets and robust storage of FABs, maps, plots, and GPS-derived data.
