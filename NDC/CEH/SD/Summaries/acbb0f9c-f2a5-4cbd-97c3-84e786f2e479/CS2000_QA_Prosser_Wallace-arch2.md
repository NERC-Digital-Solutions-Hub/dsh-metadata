# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Aim and scope
- Purpose: measure consistency and reliability of the CS2000 field programme across its major components (Quality Assurance).
- Scope: QA of 38 of 519 squares (selected from 1998 survey) with one quarter rerecorded; involved 234 species plots across nine plot types.
- Key focus areas: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, reliability of percent cover, detection of directional bias in CS2000, comparability with CS1990, landcover mapping accuracy, and recording of changes.

## Methods and design
- Sampling: One quarter of each selected square rerecorded; 34 of the squares had also been included in CS1990 for cross-comparison.
- Plot types: Seven main plot types (quadrats of various sizes, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins) analyzed; new plot types introduced for certain habitats.
- Plate relocation: Attempted relocation of buried plates; comparison with 1990/1991 QA exercises to gauge long-term relocatability.
- Data comparison: Direct comparison of CS2000 field data (TI) with QA reassessments (T2); analysis of concordance, mis-matches, and causes (identification errors, overlooked species, plot location/orientation, management changes, etc.).

## Major findings

### Plot relocation
- Relocation success: 86.7% of plots fully relocated; 60% accurately relocated, ~25% approximately relocated, ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate recovery: 69.3% of plates recovered by assessors; surveyors’ relocation success lower (about 40–45% considering potential overlaps with assessors’ findings).
- Time-interval effect: Eight years on, relocation success comparable to 12 months after burial, indicating long-term viability of the relocation approach.
- Difficulties: Small 4 m habitat plots (Y-plots) most challenging to relocate.

### Species concordance
- Overall recording accuracy: ~73% (CS2000 records confirmed by QA; 71% confirmed; ~2% non-concordances due to real changes between surveys).
- Trend vs CS1990: Similar efficiency to CS1990 (CS1990 ~78%); differences largely attributed to plot relocation errors.
- Species mis-matches: Detailed breakdown shows mis-identifications, overlooked species, and location/orientation errors as major contributors to non-concordance.

### Estimates of vegetation cover
- Five to six frequent species showed significant cover differences between CS2000 and QA, partly due to seasonal effects.
- Overall cover agreement improved relative to CS1990, with notable improvement in landuse sample points (about 74% agreement in cover levels for some species).
- Some taxa (e.g., grasses) showed more discrepancies, often linked to seasonal timing and identification difficulty.

### Direction of vegetation change
- DECORANA ordination axis shifts between CS2000 and QA were generally insignificant; no consistent directional bias detected overall or by plot type/landclass.

### Landcover mapping
- Code groups and agreement:
  - Primary landcover codes: 88% agreement
  - BAP codes: 77%
  - Primary boundary codes: 85%
  - Principal qualifying landcover codes: 73%
  - Principal qualifying boundary codes: 83%
  - Species-awarded cover: 63%
  - Species cover codes: 74%
- Overall primary land cover concordance (excluding BAP): 91.6%; including BAP: 87.5% (comparable or better than CS1990 QA).
- BAP code concordance highlighted some mismatch patterns, notably between certain barren/heath types and boundaries.

### Recording of change
- Change concordance: 51.4% overall; 33.9% of CS2000 changes not noted by CS2000; 14.7% changes recorded but not substantiated by QA.
- Indication: Substantial proportion of changes since 1990 may have been missed; surveyors often did not mark changes when 1990 codes were incorrect or omitted.
- Implication: Plot data are likely more reliable for change evaluation than the original survey codes in some cases; improved change detection requires more rigorous field verification and coding.

### Hedge diversity and arable plots
- Hedge diversity (19 samples): Total species 124; common species 92; overall concordance 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%; mean species per plot: CS2000 5.16 vs QA 5.89.
- Arable plots: Only five plots; concordance extremely poor, largely due to seasonality and unfamiliarity with ruderal species; recommendation for two well-spaced visits for future arable-margin plots.

### Changes in frequency of the most prevalent species
- Despite ~35% mis-matches in some plots, common species showed broad similarity in frequency and ranking between CS2000 and QA.
- Notable issues: mosses recording generally poor; Poa trivialis often over-recorded; some grasses under-recorded or misidentified; certain species frequently confused (e.g., Taraxacum and Galium aparine).

### Change in boundary and landuse codes (qualifications)
- Boundary and land-use qualifiers: Overall strong performance with high concordance for boundary-related codes; some ongoing issues with hedge shapes and wall condition coding.
- Stockproof/height data: High concordance (boundaries) with minor omissions; boundary height and stockproof status recorded consistently across CS2000 and QA.

## Overall interpretation and implications
- CS2000 fieldwork demonstrates strong consistency with QA in mapping and boundary coding and reasonable reliability in plot relocation and species recording.
- The QA reveals areas for improvement:
  - More frequent or strategic revisits for arable margins and season-dependent species.
  - Enhanced emphasis on plot relocation accuracy and exact orientation to reduce mis-location errors.
  - Better recording of changes between survey cycles to minimize missed changes.
- The QA supports using CS2000 data as a robust environmental monitoring dataset, while highlighting specific reliability considerations for change assessment and some taxa.

## Practical notes for Analysts Monitoring Environmental Health
- QA confirms that standardized protocols yield high concordance with independent assessment, reinforcing confidence in CS2000 outputs for long-term environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
- When integrating datasets, consider potential biases from plot relocation and plant identification, especially for grasses and episodic vegetation.
- Ensure data portals reflect QA-adjusted reliability, particularly for change data and hedge/boundary classifications, to maintain transparent, comparable time-series analyses.
