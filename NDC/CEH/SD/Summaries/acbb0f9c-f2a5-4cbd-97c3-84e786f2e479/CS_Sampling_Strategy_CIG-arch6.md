# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose: Describe how Countryside Survey (CS) field sampling has been designed and revised since its inception to produce representative, national habitat estimates for Great Britain, with emphasis on data stratification, data collection, and country-specific reporting.

## Core concepts and data model

- ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework: stratifies land into discrete classes (land classes) based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to ensure representative sampling across GB.
- Stratification rationale: reduces bias that could arise from purely random sampling by ensuring all ecological settings are represented.

## Evolution of the Land Classification

- 1978 (Initial): 1 km square sampling using 32 Land Classes derived from central squares of a 15x15 km grid; quadrats and soils surveyed; 8 samples per class (256 total).
- 1984 (Second survey): Emphasis on land use and habitat mapping; 12 squares per Land Class (384 total); continued use of the earlier classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares/3rd survey): Extended classification to all GB squares; created Land Classification maps using surrogate climatic/geophysical factors; 508 squares surveyed; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998-2000 (Revised classification for regional reporting): GB-wide classification updated to improve regional and local estimates; introduced separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and increased number of classes to 40; addressed representation imbalances.
- 2007 (Further developments for Wales reporting): Wales-specific reporting strengthened; new country-unit classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total of 45 strata; added 43 Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation; England adjustments limited to maintaining precision in remaining classes.

## Sampling framework and survey design by year

- Sampling unit: 1 km squares; primary unit for classification and habitat estimation.
- 1978 CS1: 256 squares (8 per class); national habitat estimates derived by multiplying mean habitat area per class by total area of the class.
- 1984 CS2: 384 squares (12 per class); based on 1978 classification for national estimates.
- 1990 CS3: All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; retained 1984 data plus repeat quadrats; introduced Land Cover mapping linkage.
- 2000 CS4 (CS2000): Revisions to allow separate England/Wales and Scotland estimates; 40 strata; added 19 extra squares to ensure new classes are well represented; uplands module added (30 extra squares) to improve upland habitat estimates.
- 2007 CS5 (CS2007): Welsh reporting formalized; five new Welsh country-unit classes; 43 additional Welsh squares; England in effect adjusted to compensate for Welsh additions; Wales-specific class sub-divisions implemented (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).

## Country-level reporting and upland module

- Separate country estimates: CS2000 introduced England with Wales and Scotland reporting using country-specific squares; class subdivisions and aggregations created 40-to-45 strata to support country estimates.
- Wales-focused adjustments: additional Welsh samples ensure robust Wales-only estimates; upland habitats module (CS2000) added to improve upland precision in England and Wales.

## Outputs, data products, and interpretation

- Outputs include: land-class maps, distribution statistics by Land Class, and national habitat estimates derived from (a) mean habitat area per square within each Land Class and (b) total area of each class.
- National estimates: Compiled per survey and per country unit, with notes on methodological alignment across surveys to maintain comparability.
- Cross-survey consistency note: Changes in classification affect national estimates; preference given to latest country-specific classification for internal consistency, with original classification used for cross-survey comparisons where needed.

## Practical considerations and challenges

- Balancing precision and representation: need adequate squares per class, especially after devolution and country-specific reporting.
- Data continuity and time-series value: preserving a coherent time series while updating Land Classifications to reflect policy and regional reporting needs.
- Complexity of reporting: Welsh and English reporting requirements driving adjustments in sampling and class definitions.
