# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Standardize field data collection for Countryside Survey CS2000 to enable time-series analysis and scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance.
  - Emphasizes data quality, observer consistency, clear data formats, and comparability with CS1990 methods.

- Sampling framework and design
  - Core sample: 1 x 1 km squares; total expanding to 568 squares with upland and subdivision coverage.
  - Time-series focus: re-survey of prior squares to quantify change; new squares added to capture emerging classes.
  - Country-level reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) with appropriate class subdivisions; aims to maintain comparability across years.

- Planning, site visits, and logistics
  - Six survey teams, each responsible for roughly 95 squares; typical square surveyed in about four days.
  - Flexible scheduling, minimal site revisits, and prioritization of goodwill with landowners; old squares surveyed in the same order as in 1990 to minimize seasonal variation.

- Equipment, safety, and access
  - Comprehensive field equipment lists, safety protocols, GPS/mapping support, and on-site identification requirements.
  - Landowner consent required; procedures for refusals (abandon or adapt survey) and background landowner data maintained.

- Field procedures and data capture
  - Two main square types: old (repeat observations) and new (de novo mapping).
  - Full square survey routes planned for comprehensive coverage; post-survey checks for omissions and clarity.
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) used to aggregate square data, maps, codes, and notes with standardized coding.

- Mapping, data themes, and change reliability
  - CS2000 refinements: change-only approach in old squares; reporting by Broad Habitats with some finer Mappable/Plottable BAPs.
  - Introduction of additional plots to monitor upland and unenclosed landscapes; standardized processes link to CS1990/C S2000 codes.
  - Emphasis on standardization to minimize observer variation and to document genuine changes reliably.

- Plots and vegetation sampling (plot types)
  - X plots (Large/Wally): 200 m2 with nested subplots for species presence and cover; permanent relocation markers.
  - Y plots (Small): 2 m x 2 m, five per square across land-cover types; baseline vegetation sampling.
  - U plots (Unenclosed): 2 m x 2 m in unenclosed habitats; number depends on proportion of plottable broad habitats.
  - B plots (Boundary): 200 m2 plots along boundaries to monitor changes.
  - A plots (Arable margins): 100 x 1 m plots to track arable weed changes.
  - H and D plots (Hedgerows): various hedgerow plots to monitor woody diversity and changes.
  - S/W plots (Streamside/Waterside) and R/V plots (Roadside/Verge): linear plots along watercourses and roads for habitat monitoring.
  - Detailed relocation, layout, measurement, species recording, and permanent-marker procedures to ensure year-to-year comparability.

- Vegetation recording and taxon data
  - Standard vegetation recording sheet: header, list of ~200 common species, space for unlisted taxa; Latin names preferred.
  - Cover estimated in 5% increments; up to three dominant codes per plot for mosaics; aggregations allowed for difficult taxa to preserve consistency with prior surveys.
  - Bryophytes and lichens tracked using a defined list with specific cover values; others not recorded beyond the list.

- Boundary, buildings, and human infrastructure
  - Detailed boundary coding for walls, fences, hedges, banks, gates, and stockproof status; buildings and curtilage; roads, verges, tracks, and related infrastructure.

- Data quality, standardization, and change reliability
  - Strong emphasis on standardized methods to reduce observer variation; quality control measures to ensure consistency across observers and years.
  - Specific codes distinguish genuine change from probable mis-recording; documented processes for change assessment when mapping old vs new data.

- Annexes and practical details
  - Annex 1: Collecting and integrating GPS data (step-by-step guidance).
  - Pond mapping and changes from 1990 data for lowland squares; careful pond definition updates.
  - Calluna sampling and freshwater biota sampling described (methods and logistics) as part of Section 10.

- Section 10- Sampling
  - Three sampling types: soil, Calluna vulgaris foliar nitrogen, and freshwater biota (the latter by IFE staff).
  - Soil sampling: five replicate cores per 1 km square (in X-plots) for chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiological status; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing and storage.
  - Calluna sampling: seasonal growth stage (current-year growth) sampled across squares to assess nitrogen deposition effects; standardized collection, labeling, drying/prioritization for transport.
  - Logistics: distribution lists, post/transport procedures, and timetables to ensure timely processing.

- Section 11- Photography
  - Cameras supplied; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks.
  - Use of reference features that are obvious, permanent, and visible; plots photographed with plot numbers and square identifiers on a marker board.

- Section 12- Procedures after survey
  - Post-survey data verification steps; avoidance of data transcription unless necessary; timely return of FABs and samples to ITE stations.

- Annex- GPS data collection guidelines
  - Step-by-step GPS setup, stationary vs. moving feature logging, custom file naming, sampling rate settings, and navigation of the attribute reference to speed plotting.
  - Tips on achieving good PDOP values, minimizing obstructions, and proper battery management.

- Implications for analysts
  - Provides a rigorous, standardized framework for multi-year, multi-region environmental data collection.
  - Supports robust trend analysis in land use, habitat change, vegetation composition, and boundary management for policy evaluation and biodiversity monitoring.
  - Balances national-scale habitat monitoring with detailed plot-level ecological data to enable both broad and fine-grained analyses.
