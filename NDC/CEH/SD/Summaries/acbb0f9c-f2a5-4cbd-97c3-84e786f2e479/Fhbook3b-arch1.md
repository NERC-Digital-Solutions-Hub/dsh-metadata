# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Purpose and scope (from this portion)
- Provides standardized protocols for vegetation taxon coding, soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling.
- Aims to support robust, time-series ecological data across GB suitable for policy-relevant analyses and monitoring.

## Taxa coding and data standardization
- Detailed, hierarchical coding schemes for taxa to enable consistent data entry on FABs (Field Assessment Books).
- FERNS, FORBS/WOODY SPECIES, and MOSSES/LICHENS sections with explicit code-to-name mappings and placeholders for unlisted taxa.
- Emphasis on using standard codes, ground-truthing where needed, and handling mosaics or boundary changes with linked parcel IDs.

## Sampling types and scope
- Three sampling domains:
  - Soil sampling (CS2000): five replicate soil chemistry, soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status samples per 1 km square; cores taken from specific locations within center plots.
  - Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen-focused sampling to relate deposition to Calluna vitality; cross-square collection within each square containing Calluna.
  - Freshwater biota sampling: conducted by IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 fieldwork.

## Soil sampling procedures
- Five replicates per square in 1 km squares; in each X-plot center, three soil cores collected using three pipes (one long black, two short white) at 15 cm north/east/west from the center corner.
- Immediate posting/shipping of the two white-pipe samples to ITE Merlewood; longer-term storage and transport of the long black pipe sample.
- Detailed field handling instructions (protecting sample integrity, labeling, packing, and posting).

## Calluna sampling
- Within each square with Calluna vulgaris, collect CYG (current year growth) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) randomly from plants.
- Air-dry or partially dry samples as needed before sealing and mailing to ITE Merlewood.

## Freshwater sampling
- Conducted by trained IFE staff; CS2000 field teams coordinate timing and locations to minimize conflicts with fieldwork.

## Field photography
- One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks.
- Include clearly legible square/plot identifiers on reference boards; compose photos to emphasize plot and key features while avoiding excessive sky.

## Data integrity, forms and management
- Emphasis on thorough data verification at day-end; avoid duplicating information on new materials unless necessary.
- FABs, samples, base maps, and metadata are organized for transfer to ITE stations; aim to maintain data provenance and cross-year comparability.

## GPS data collection (Annex 1)
- Pre-checks: ensure GPS power, satellite view, and PDOP at acceptable levels (PDOP ideally below 6 for 3D fixes).
- Record stationary features (plots) and moving features (boundaries) with dedicated file naming per square and feature (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4; 501F1.MOB for a new feature).
- Create a separate data file for each plot or feature; adopt 15 predefined attribute options to classify features.
- Guidance on operating the Magellan keypad, handling obstacles, and ensuring a clear sky view for optimal satellite reception.

## Post-survey procedures
- Review data sheets daily to ensure completeness; avoid retroactively transcribing unless essential.
- Arrange prompt transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations for processing.

## Practical outputs and implications for analysts
- Produces standardized, time-series-ready datasets across GB with explicit coding, sampling, and metadata protocols.
- Enables robust statistical analyses of vegetation composition, habitat change, soil quality indicators, and Calluna nitrogen dynamics in relation to deposition.
- Facilitates data discoverability and comparative analyses across years through consistent parcel coding, change-tracking rules, and GPS-based plot relocation data.
