# THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the sampling framework and evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify and sample field surveys for Countryside Survey from its origins to the 2007 cycle.
  - Emphasises the linkage between stratification (ITE Land Classification) and time-series data, enabling national and country-level estimates of habitats and land use.
  - Highlights the need for representative, unbiased samples and the role of stratification in reducing sampling error.

- Core concepts: stratification and sampling units
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure samples represent different land types and ecological conditions.
  - Primary sampling unit: 1 km square (land-class unit). For classification, a centre square was initially classified, with surrounding squares allocated to the class via the classification key.
  - Early practice used eight 1 km squares per Land Class to derive national estimates (256 total).

- Development of the ITE Land Classification (basics)
  - Origin in the 1970s: classify land areas by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) rather than raw species data.
  - Initial approach used the Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on a subset of squares and extended to larger scales (e.g., 1 km squares) to create 32 Land Classes.
  - The Land Classification served as the sampling framework, ensuring sampling across the ecological diversity of Great Britain.

- Survey milestones and sampling frameworks
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and first field survey)
    - ISA-based 32 Land Classes from 1 km squares (centre squares) and four surrounding squares, totaling classification of about 6,039 km squares.
    - Field survey: 8 squares per Land Class (256 total).
    - National estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class.
  - 1984 (Second land use survey)
    - Used the same sampling framework; increased total squares to 384 (12 per class), including eight previously visited.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Countryside Survey 1990)
    - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB squares (not just the classified subset); 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked with first Land Cover Map of GB; retained field-collected features and vegetation data.
    - Resulted in a shift to a broader, all-squares framework; some squares reclassified, urban/seas corrections applied.
  - Developments through CS1990–CS2000
    - Recognition that national/regional estimates required a consistent framework across all squares; attempts to classify every square using surrogate variables and various multivariate approaches.
    - Comparisons showed limited exact matches (about 62%), but class means remained stable; misclassifications typically fell into neighboring classes.
    - CS2000 introduced country-based reporting (England with Wales, Scotland) with 40 strata by subdividing Land Classes into country-unit versions, aggregating where necessary, and adding squares to ensure representation of new classes.
    - Additional uplands module introduced to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Wales-focused reporting)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further Wales-specific subdivisions (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure adequate representation; England adjustments were kept minimal (some classes with only four squares).
    - Wales and England/Scotland frameworks updated to reflect devolution and policy needs; revised maps show England with Wales and Scotland classifications.
  
- Country-specific and reporting considerations
  - Separate country estimates approach: estimates are calculated by country using only squares within that country.
  - UK-wide consistency requires documenting changes in Land Classification across survey cycles; comparability can be affected by reclassification between cycles.
  - Modules and sub-divisions (e.g., country-unit classes, uplands module) enhance precision for Wales and upland habitats but introduce complexity for cross-country comparisons.

- Summary of sampling and scale (highlights)
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per Land Class across 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares; shifted to all-squares land classification framework; national estimates aligned to 1990 classification.
  - CS2000: expanded to 40 strata; country-unit subdivision; additional squares to improve representation; uplands module added.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused refinements; 45 strata; additional Welsh squares; country-unit sub-divisions implemented to support Wales reporting; England adjustments kept minimal.

- Data governance and interpretation implications
  - Changing the underlying Land Classification impacts national estimate consistency; preferable approach for individual surveys is to use the latest classification, while older classifications may be used for cross-survey comparability.
  - Documentation of class definitions and sampling allocations is essential for reproducibility and for understanding shifts in estimated habitat areas over time.
  - The framework supports time-series analysis with country-specific reporting but requires careful handling of reclassifications and additions of new country-unit classes.
