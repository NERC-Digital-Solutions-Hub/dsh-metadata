# HUMBER CATHCMENT

## Aim
- To support others in exploring data and obtaining useful insights by finding, combining, analysing data, and creating data products for others to explore readily.
- Leverages data analysis and communication skills to support data use across a broad range of topics.
- Often work for organisations with less specialised remits (e.g., local councils or private companies).

## Who they are
- Have data analysis and communication skills, supporting a broad range of topics rather than specialising deeply.
- Often work for less specialised organisations like local councils or private companies, supporting policy work and sometimes communicating data publicly.

## How they meet their aims
- Understand the ask: figure out what is needed and why, and the best way to meet those needs.
- Find and verify sufficient data, potentially seeking help from topic experts.
- Quality assure, clean, and transform data into appropriate formats, combining datasets.
- Analyse patterns to identify significant features.
- Create products like dashboards or pivot tables to enable end users to self-serve, or create reports and charts, providing guidance on using these tools.
- Promote outputs and gather feedback to develop products further, potentially sharing early prototypes.
- Advocate for better data creation.

## Context in Humber Catchment
- Applied in environments such as catchment management, local government, or private organisations to support environmental management, policy development, and stakeholder communication through data-enabled insights and self-serve tools.

## Particular Challenges
- Time spent understanding the ask due to a lack of data consideration in wider teams.
- Working with patchy data in a wide range of formats.
- Accessing different systems to find and access data.
- Difficulty communicating complex information simply.
- Promoting outputs to ensure they are used; concerns that outputs are not being as widely shared and re-used as they could be.
