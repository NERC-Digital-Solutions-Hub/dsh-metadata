# Triazine, organophosphate and pyrethroid (TOP) pesticide data LOIS Core Programme

## Aim and context
- Monitoring the occurrence, fate, and flux transfer of micro-organics in LOIS rivers to assess environmental pollution and background information for specialized research.
- Focus on Humber Rivers draining to the North Sea; key study sites include Aire, Calder, Trent, and Don; Ouse used as a rural control.

## Data and measurements

- Analytes and units
  - Atrazine, Cyanazin, Desmetryn, Fenitrothion, HCH gamma, Malathion, Parathion, Prometryn, Simazine, Terbutryn
  - Permethrin (cis and trans)
  - All concentrations reported in micrograms per litre (ug/l)
  - Measurements refer to whole water (unfiltered) samples

- Sampling sites (site code, location)
  - S1: Swale at Catterick Bridge (SE225994)
  - S2: Swale at Thornton Manor (SE433715)
  - U3: Ure at Boroughbridge (SE395671)
  - N4: Nidd at Skip Bridge (SE482561)
  - W5: Wharfe at Tadcaster (SE487435)
  - O6: Ouse at Clifton Bridge (SE589528)
  - D7: Derwent at Bubwith (SE706364)
  - A8: Aire at Beal Bridge (SE534255)
  - C9: Calder at Methley Bridge (SE409258)
  - D10: Don at Sprotborough Bridge (SE538014)
  - T11: Trent at Cromwell Lock (SK807612)
  - O12: Ouse at Acaster Malbis (SE594445)
  - A20: Aire at Allerton Bywater (SE417274)

- Temporal coverage
  - Regular weekly sampling with intensified collection during high-flow storm periods
  - Timeframe: 1994–1996

- How samples were collected and processed
  - Collected in presolvent washed 1 L borosilicate bottles from channel midpoints
  - Transported to LOIS York Laboratory for SPE separation using Isolute cartridges (120-1008F) and C18 SPE (Isolute 221-0100-C)
  - Overnight storage at ~5°C; transported to IFE Wareham for elution with ethyl acetate
  - Combined eluates from filtered solids and water, dried, and concentrated with nitrogen
  - Analysis methods:
    - Triazines and organophosphorus pesticides: nitrogen-phosphate bead detector (GC/NPD)
    - Pyrethroids: GC/MS in single ion mode

## Quality control and data quality

- Field blanks: ultrapure water collected and analyzed identically to samples
- Spiked samples: included in each batch to assess pesticide recoveries
- Internal standards: ametryn for GC/NPD; Decachlorbiphenol for GC/MS
- Compound identification
  - Triazines and organochlorines: identified by relative retention time (RRT) against ametryn ±0.002
  - Pyrethroids: identified by RRT and matching base ion plus a second fragment (GC/MS)
- Data quality outputs
  - Zip file containing box-and-whisker plots for each determinant, showing range, median, interquartile range, and outliers to help prospective users assess data quality

## Data handling and producers

- Field sampling and extraction: LOIS team, York University
- Elution and sample preparation for GC analysis: IFE, Wareham

## Outputs and references

- Purpose of data: provide background information for LOIS special topics and enable broader data use
