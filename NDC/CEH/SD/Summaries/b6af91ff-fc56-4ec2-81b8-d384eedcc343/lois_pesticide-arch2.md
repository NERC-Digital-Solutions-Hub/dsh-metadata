# Triazine, organophosphate and pyrethroid (TOP) pesticide data LOIS Core Programme

## Purpose and scope
- LOIS rivers programme aims to determine levels of micro-organics in Humber Rivers and assess their flux transfer to the estuarine environment.
- Focus on major industrial rivers (Aire, Calder, Trent, Don) with the Ouse as a rural control.
- The TOP pesticide dataset provides background data to support broader LOIS research and future specialized studies.

## Data coverage (what and where)
- Analytes and units:
  - Atrazine, Cyanazin, Desmetryn, Fenitrothion, HCH gamma, Malathion, Parathion, Prometryn, Simazine, Terbutryn; Permethrin (cis and trans).
  - Units: micrograms per litre (ug/l).
  - Measurements refer to whole (unfiltered) river water.
- Sampling sites (examples of study sites and codes):
  - Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1)
  - Swale at Thornton Manor (S2)
  - Ure at Boroughbridge (U3)
  - Nidd at Skip Bridge (N4)
  - Wharfe at Tadcaster (W5)
  - Ouse at Clifton Bridge (O6)
  - Derwent at Bubwith (D7)
  - Aire at Beal Bridge (A8)
  - Calder at Methley Bridge (C9)
  - Don at Sprotborough Bridge (D10)
  - Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11)
  - Ouse at Acaster Malbis (O12)
  - Aire at Allerton Bywater (A20)
- Time frame:
  - Data collected regularly weekly and intermittently during high-flow periods, 1994–1996.

## Methods (how measurements were made)
- Sample collection and handling:
  - Collectors used presolvent-washed 1 L borosilicate bottles from mid-channel.
  - Samples returned to LOIS York Laboratory for SPE-based processing; SPE cartridges stored at 4°C overnight; transported to IFE Wareham for elution and prep.
  - Elution with ethyl acetate; eluates combined with filtered solids and water; extracts dried and concentrated with nitrogen.
- Analytical techniques:
  - Triazines and organophosphorus pesticides: analyzed by nitrogen-phosphorus detector (GC/NPD) after concentration.
  - Pyrethroids: analyzed by GC/MS in single ion mode.
- Quality control and quality assurance (QA/QC):
  - Field blanks: ultrapure water processed in the field and analyzed with samples.
  - Spiked water samples: included in each batch to assess pesticide recoveries.
  - Internal standards in GC analysis: ametryn (GC/NPD) and Decachlorbiphenol (GC/MS).
  - Identification criteria:
    - Triazines/organophosphorus: identified by retention time relative to ametryn (+/- 0.002 RRT); some confirmations by concentration and GC/MS.
    - Pyrethroids: identified by RRT and base ion plus a second fragment ion.
- Data products regarding data quality:
  - Zip file containing box-and-whisker plots for each determinand, displaying range, median, IQR, 1.5x IQR, and outliers by site to help users gauge data quality.

## Data handling and accessibility
- Data collection and extraction conducted by LOIS team (York University) with elution and GC prep by IFE, Wareham.
- Box-and-whisker plots provided as a data-quality aid to prospective users.
- The dataset is framed to support broader environmental monitoring and evaluation against standards and time series analyses.

## Outputs and context for use
- The data provide background levels and site-specific variability of TOP pesticides in various LOIS River sites, enabling:
  - Assessment of environmental health and pollutant flux within the Humber River system.
  - Baseline context for more specialized LOIS topics and policy relevance.
