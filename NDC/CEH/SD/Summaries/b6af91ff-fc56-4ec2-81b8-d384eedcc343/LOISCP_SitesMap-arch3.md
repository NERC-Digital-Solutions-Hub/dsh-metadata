# HUMBER CATHCMENT

- Content status: The provided text contains only the document title with no sections, findings, or descriptions to summarize.
- If expanded, a Humber Catchment monitoring framework would typically address:
  - Identification of environmental health measures to scrutinise policy and inform decisions
  - Stakeholder engagement to determine useful measures and avoid duplication
  - Data discovery and verification, including obtaining metadata and contacting data originators to fill gaps
  - Metadata enhancement, data openness, and public sharing of underlying data (where appropriate)
  - Commissioning new data to fill gaps, with quality assurance and data management standards set at the source
  - Data processing: cleaning, transformation, analysis, and clear presentation via reports, charts, or dashboards
  - Dissemination to stakeholders, consultation, and governance processes for data sharing and management
- Common challenges for authors of monitoring frameworks (relevant to the Humber catchment context):
  - Data scarcity or data that does not meet required standards
  - Limited access to data or delays in access
  - Silos within and between organizations hindering collaboration
  - Barriers to using data due to requirements to publicly share datasets
  - Keeping data up to date and maintaining timely data sharing
  - Inadequate metadata making verification difficult
  - Data formats requiring effortful transformation to be usable
  - Communicating complex findings clearly
  - Establishing data governance to ensure standards, storage, sharing, and ongoing updates
