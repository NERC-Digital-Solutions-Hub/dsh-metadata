# Triazine, organophosphate and pyrethroid (TOP) pesticide data LOIS Core Programme

## Overview
- LOIS rivers programme monitors micro-organics to assess environmental pollution, focusing on Humber Rivers and flux to the estuary.
- Study emphasis: determine levels in key rivers, provide background for specialized topics, with Humber as primary focus; rural control via the Ouse.
- Data collection period: weekly samples and storm-period samples during 1994–1996.
- Sample handling: unfiltered (whole water) samples collected in presolvent-washed 1 L borosilicate bottles; processed the day of collection via solid-phase extraction (SPE), cartridges stored at 4°C overnight, then transported for analysis.

## Variables and units
- Target analytes (concentrations in ug/L): Atrazine, Cyanazin, Desmetryn, Fenitrothion, HCH gamma, Malathion, Parathion, Permethrin (cis and trans), Prometryn, Simazine, Terbutryn.
- All concentrations refer to whole water (unfiltered) samples.

## Sampling sites and metadata
- Multiple LOIS sites with codes and NGR references, e.g.:
  - S1: Swale at Catterick Bridge
  - S2: Swale at Thornton Manor
  - U3: Ure at Boroughbridge
  - N4: Nidd at Skip Bridge
  - W5: Wharfe at Tadcaster
  - O6: Ouse at Clifton Bridge
  - D7: Derwent at Bubwith
  - A8: Aire at Beal Bridge
  - C9: Calder at Methley Bridge
  - D10: Don at Sprotborough Bridge
  - T11: Trent at Cromwell Lock
  - O12: Ouse at Acaster Malbis
  - A20: Aire at Allerton Bywater
- Coordinates (NGR) provided for each site; variables monitored include all determinations for each site.

## Data collection timeframe and methods
- Measured at regular weekly intervals with intermittent high-flow sampling during 1994–1996.
- Field collection: mid-channel sampling using presolvent-washed bottles; samples returned to LOIS York Laboratory.
- Laboratory processing: separation via frits and SPE (Isolute 120-1008F; Isolute 1 g C18) per SOPs; elution with ethyl acetate; combined with water; dried and concentrated by nitrogen.

## Analytical methods
- Triazines and organophosphate pesticides: analyzed by nitrogen-phosphate bead detector (GC/NPD).
- Pyrethroids: analyzed by GC/MS in single ion mode.
- Internal standards: ametryn (GC/NPD) and Decachlorbiphenol (GC/MS).

## Quality control and data quality
- Field blanks: ultrapure water treated on-site and analyzed with samples.
- Spiked samples: batches include spiked water to assess recoveries.
- Internal standards used in GC analyses.
- Compound identification: based on retention time (RRT) relative to ametryn (±0.002 RRT) and corroborated by ion data; pyrethroids confirmed by base ion and additional fragment ions; some samples validated by GC/MS concentration comparisons.
- Data presentation: box-and-whisker plots per determinand by site, showing range, median, interquartile range, and outliers; provided as a ZIP file to help users assess data quality.

## Data custodians and provenance
- Field sampling and pesticide extraction conducted by LOIS team (York University); elution and GC preparation performed at IFE, Wareham.

## Accessibility and documentation
- Box-and-whisker plot ZIP file supplied for each determinand to aid prospective users in understanding data quality.
- SOP references for sampling and analysis: SOP 17/14.11.93 (field/sample prep) and SOP 24/20.4.94 (elution/prep).
