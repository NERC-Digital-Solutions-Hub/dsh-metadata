# Triazine, organophosphate and pyrethroid (TOP) pesticide data LOIS Core Programme

## Overview and aims
- Part of the LOIS rivers programme focusing on occurrence, fate, and flux transfer of micro-organics to estuarine environments, with emphasis on Humber Rivers and industrial rivers (Aire, Calder, Trent, Don) and rural Ouse as a control.

## Data scope
- Analytes: Atrazine, Cyanazin, Desmetryn, Fenitrothion, HCH gamma, Malathion, Parathion, Permethrin (cis and trans), Prometryn, Simazine, Terbutryn.
- Units: micrograms per litre (µg/L).
- Samples: unfiltered whole-water samples from river channels.
- Time period: 1994–1996, collected weekly and during high-flow/storm events.

## Sampling and analytical methods
- Collection: presolvent-washed 1 L borosilicate bottles from mid-channel; field blanks included.
- Extraction: solid-phase extraction (SPE) using Isolute cartridges; cartridges stored at 4°C overnight; transported to IFE Wareham.
- Processing: elution with ethyl acetate, combination with solids/water, drying and concentration under nitrogen.
- Instrumentation: 
  - Triazines and organophosphorus pesticides analyzed by nitrogen-phosphate bead detector (NPD) GC.
  - Pyrethroids analyzed by GC-MS in single ion mode.
- Protocols: SOP 17/14.11.93 (IFE, Wareham) for extraction; SOP 24/20.4.94 for elution and preparation.

## Quality control and data quality
- Field blanks: ultrapure water sampled at collection site and analyzed identically.
- Spiked samples: batched with all pesticides to assess recoveries.
- Internal standards: ametryn (GC/NPD) and decachlorbiphenyl (GC/MS).
- Identification: retention time with ametryn (±0.002 RRT) and GC/MS confirmation; pyrethroids identified by base ion and a second fragment.
- Data quality aid: zip file of box-and-whisker plots per determinand showing ranges (median, IQR, 1.5 IQR, outliers) for site-level context.

## Temporal coverage and workflow
- Sampling cadence: weekly with intensified sampling during high-flow periods.
- Overall workflow: field collection → SPE extraction → elution and preparation → GC/NPD and GC/MS analysis → QA checks → data products and accessibility.

## Data products and accessibility
- Box-and-whisker plots (zip file) provided for each determinand to help prospective users assess data quality and variability across sites.

## Data stewardship and contributors
- Field sampling and extraction: LOIS team, York University.
- Elution and sample preparation for GC analysis: IFE, Wareham.
- Reference framework: House et al. 1997, Micro-organic compounds in the Humber Rivers.
