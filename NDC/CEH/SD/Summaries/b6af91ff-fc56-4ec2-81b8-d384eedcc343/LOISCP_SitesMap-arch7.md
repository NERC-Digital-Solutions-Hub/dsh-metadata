# HUMBER CATHCMENT

- Overview
  - The document content is limited to the title; no further text is available to extract key points.

- GIS Specialist Perspective
  - If this document concerns Humber Catchment, anticipate a focus on map-based data products to support understanding and exploration of the catchment area for policy, planning, or public information.

- Data and Data Management
  - Identify and verify data sources for catchment boundaries, river networks, land use, hydrology, rainfall, and water quality.
  - Clean, transform, and integrate datasets of varying resolutions; reconcile differences between sources.

- Visualization and Outputs
  - Produce map-based visualisations showing catchment extent, sub-catchments, hydrological features, infrastructure, and land cover.
  - Develop interactive or static maps suitable for policymakers, clients, or public audiences.

- Data Quality and Standards
  - Implement quality assurance and metadata practices; ensure consistent data standards and interoperability across datasets.

- Stakeholder Engagement
  - Engage end users early, test prototypes, and iterate designs based on feedback.

- Challenges and Considerations
  - Data availability and resolution gaps; information scattered across multiple locations.
  - Lack of consistent data standards and potential data quality issues.
  - Large or complex datasets requiring careful packaging and processing.
  - Need for skilled teams to perform cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

- Suggested Next Steps (if applicable)
  - Gather and harmonise data; establish a common coordinate reference system.
  - Define initial catchment boundary and produce a prototype map.
  - Collect user feedback and refine data products accordingly.
