# Triazine, organophosphate and pyrethroid (TOP) pesticide data LOIS Core Programme

## Introduction
- Investigates occurrence, fate, and flux transfer of micro-organics in LOIS rivers, with a focus on Humber Rivers.
- Aims to determine levels in key rivers and assess flux to the estuarine environment.
- Major sites include industrial rivers (Aire, Calder, Trent, Don) and Ouse as a rural control.
- Supports broader LOIS programme and background for specialised topics.

## Summary
- Water samples collected weekly and during storm periods from 1994–1996.
- Unfiltered samples extracted on collection day using solid-phase extraction (SPE); SPE cartridges stored at 4°C and shipped for elution, drying, and GC analysis.
- Analytes measured in whole water (unfiltered) samples.

## When it was measured
- Regular weekly intervals and intermittent high-flow periods during 1994–1996.

## How it was measured
- Field: samples collected in presolvent-washed 1 L borosilicate bottles from the channel midpoint.
- Lab workflow: LOIS York Laboratory performed SPE (Isolute cartridges) and concentration; elution and preparation at IFE Wareham; extracts dried and concentrated.
- Instrumentation: Triazines and organophosphorus pesticides analysed by nitrogen-phosphate bead detector (NPD) after GC; pyrethroids analysed by GC/MS in single ion mode.

## Quality Control
- Field blanks (ultrapure water) collected on-site and processed identically.
- Spiked water samples included in each batch to assess recoveries.
- Internal standards used in GC analysis: ametryn (GC/NPD) and Decachlorbiphenol (GC/MS).

## Data Quality
- Compound identification via relative retention time (RRT) with respect to ametryn (±0.002 RRT).
- GC/MS verification for selected samples; confirmation also via ion fragments and co-elution.
- Box-and-whisker plots (zip file) provided for each determinand to show data range, median, quartiles, and outliers.

## Who measured it
- Sampling and extraction by LOIS team at York University.
- Elution and sample preparation for GC analysis conducted at IFE, Wareham.

## Data products and access
- Box-and-whisker plots zip file available for each determinand, illustrating data quality and distribution by site.

## GIS relevance and potential data products
- Map-based visualization of concentrations by site for each compound and across time.
- Temporal GIS analyses: weekly vs storm-period patterns; seasonal or high-flow effects.
- Spatial comparisons among rivers and sites to identify pollution hotspots.
- Integrated datasets with coordinates (NGR) support precise geocoding and spatial joins.
- Quality context visualization via included QC plots and RRT-based identifications.
- Consider data standardization and resolution challenges when combining multiple sites and analytes for GIS dashboards.
