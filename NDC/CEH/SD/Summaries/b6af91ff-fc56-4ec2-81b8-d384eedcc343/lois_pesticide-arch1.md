# Triazine, organophosphate and pyrethroid (TOP) pesticide data LOIS Core Programme

- Aim
  - Assess occurrence, fate, and flux transfer of micro-organics in LOIS rivers.
  - Determine levels in key Humber River sites and estimate flux to the estuarine environment.
  - Provide background data for LOIS special topics and support research on specific compounds.
  - Focused monitoring on Humber Rivers with industrial rivers (Aire, Calder, Trent, Don) and a rural Ouse site as control.

- Scope and data characteristics
  - Timeframe: 1994–1996
  - Frequency: weekly sampling, plus additional collections during high-flow/storm events
  - Sample type: unfiltered, whole-water samples (measured concentrations in ug/l)

- Measured compounds (determinants)
  - Atrazine, Cyanazin, Desmetryn, Fenitrothion, HCH gamma, Malathion, Parathion, Permethrin (cis and trans), Prometryn, Simazine, Terbutryn
  - Units: micrograms per litre (ug/l)

- Measurement locations (sites and codes)
  - Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1; SE225994)
  - Swale at Thornton Manor (S2; SE433715)
  - Ure at Boroughbridge (U3; SE395671)
  - Nidd at Skip Bridge (N4; SE482561)
  - Wharfe at Tadcaster (W5; SE487435)
  - Ouse at Clifton Bridge (O6; SE589528)
  - Derwent at Bubwith (D7; SE706364)
  - Aire at Beal Bridge (A8; SE534255)
  - Calder at Methley Bridge (C9; SE409258)
  - Don at Sprotborough Bridge (D10; SE538014)
  - Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11; SK807612)
  - Ouse at Acaster Malbis (O12; SE594445)
  - Aire at Allerton Bywater (A20; SE417274)

- How measurements were made (methods)
  - Field: collect 1 L presolvent-clean bottles from the midpoint of the channel
  - Lab workflow: LOIS York Laboratory – separation by frits and SPE (Isolute 1 g C18) per SOPs; storage at ~4–5°C; elution with ethyl acetate; combine eluates with water, then concentrate with nitrogen
  - Instrumental analysis: 
    - Triazines and organophosphorus pesticides analyzed by GC with nitrogen-phosphorus detector (NPD)
    - Pyrethroids analyzed by GC/MS in single ion mode
  - Quality assurance SOPs referenced (SOP 17/14.11.93; SOP 24/20.4.94)

- Quality control and data quality
  - Field blanks: ultrapure water collected and processed identically
  - Spiked samples: included in each batch to assess recoveries
  - Internal standards: ametryn (GC/NPD) and Decachlorbiphenol (GC/MS)
  - Compound identification: relative retention time (RRT) to ametryn ±0.002; GC/MS confirmation via base ion and a second fragment
  - Data products: box-and-whisker plots (zip file) for each determinand across sites to convey data quality and distribution

- Data management and personnel
  - Sampling and extraction: LOIS team, York University
  - Elution and GC preparation: IFE, Wareham
  - Documentation and reference: House et al., 1997 (micro-organic compounds in the Humber Rivers)
