# Triazine, organophosphate and pyrethroid (TOP) pesticide data LOIS Core Programme

## Overview
- LOIS rivers programme aims to determine levels of micro-organics in Humber Rivers and assess flux transfer to the estuary.
- Focuses on industrial rivers (Aire, Calder, Trent, Don) with the Ouse as rural control.
- Data underpin background information for broader research and policy evaluation within LOIS topics.

## Monitoring scope and targets
- Target chemicals: Triazines, organophosphorus pesticides, and pyrethroids (TOP pesticides).
- Variables measured: Atrazine, Cyanazin, Desmetryn, Fenitrothion, HCH gamma, Malathion, Parathion, Permethrin (cis), Permethrin (trans), Prometryn, Simazine, Terbutryn.
- Units: Micrograms per liter (ug/l).
- Sample type: Whole water (unfiltered) from rivers.

## Sampling design and locations
- Temporal coverage: Weekly sampling with additional collection during high-flow (storm) periods.
- Timeframe: 1994–1996.
- Sites: Multiple LOIS core stations across major rivers, including:
  - Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1)
  - Swale at Thornton Manor (S2)
  - Ure at Boroughbridge (U3)
  - Nidd at Skip Bridge (N4)
  - Wharfe at Tadcaster (W5)
  - Ouse at Clifton Bridge (O6)
  - Derwent at Bubwith (D7)
  - Aire at Beal Bridge (A8)
  - Calder at Methley Bridge (C9)
  - Don at Sprotborough Bridge (D10)
  - Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11)
  - Ouse at Acaster Malbis (O12)
  - Aire at Allerton Bywater (A20)
- Site metadata: Each site includes a unique user code and National Grid Reference (NGR); variable set to All variables at each site.

## Sampling and laboratory methods
- Sampling procedure: Presolvent-washed 1 L borosilicate bottles collected from the channel midpoint by immersion.
- In-field handling: Samples returned to LOIS York Laboratory; separation via filtration through frits and C18 SPE (Isolute).
- Storage and transport: Overnight at ~4–5°C; transported to IFE Wareham for elution and preparation.
- Extraction and analysis:
  - SPE elution with ethyl acetate; extracts dried and concentrated under nitrogen.
  - Triazines and organophosphorus pesticides analyzed by GC with nitrogen-phosphorus detection (NPD).
  - Pyrethroids analyzed by GC/MS in single ion mode.
- Documentation: SOPs referenced (SOP 17/14.11.93; SOP 24/20.4.94).

## Quality control and data quality
- Field blanks: Ultrapure water blanks collected and analyzed identically.
- Recoveries: Spiked water samples included in each batch to assess pesticide recoveries.
- Internal standards: Ametryn for GC/NPD; Decachlorobiphenyl for GC/MS.
- Identification and verification: 
  - Triazines and organochlorines identified by retention time relative to ametryn (±0.002 RRT) and confirmed by GC/MS in some samples.
  - Pyrethroids identified by matching retention times and ion fragments (base ion plus another fragment).
- Data quality presentation: Box-and-whisker plots (zip file) provided for each determinand to convey ranges, medians, IQR, and outliers at each site.

## Data governance, sharing, and outputs
- Data management and sharing: Outputs include reports and charts; underlying data are intended to be shared appropriately, with a note on data governance and transparency.
- Accessibility aids: Zip file of quality plots to help prospective users assess data quality and suitability.
- Roles and responsibilities: 
  - Sampling and extraction conducted by LOIS team (York University).
  - Elution and sample preparation for GC analysis performed at IFE, Wareham.
