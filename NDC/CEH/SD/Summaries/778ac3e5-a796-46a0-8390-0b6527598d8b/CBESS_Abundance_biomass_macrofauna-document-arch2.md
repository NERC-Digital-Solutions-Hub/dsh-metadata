# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) mobile macrofaunal abundance, biomass and species richness from Fyke netting in mudflat habitats.

## Overview
- Dataset measuring abundance, biomass, and species richness of larger mobile macrofauna using fyke netting in mudflat habitats.
- Part of Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) initiative.
- Collected during Winter and Summer 2013.

## Data scope and sampling design
- Locations: Essex and Morecambe Bay mudflats.
  - Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Habitat descriptions:
  - Essex: protected estuarine mudflats with cohesive clays, mud, and silt.
  - Morecambe Bay: mudflats with coarse, mobile sediments; more exposed with larger tidal ranges.
- Sampling method:
  - Larger mobile macrofauna caught with five double hoop fyke nets (mesh 22 mm knot to knot; 8 m leader; 0.5 m hoop).
  - Nets deployed at the outer edge of each quadrat over two tidal cycles; catches processed the following day.
- Temporal coverage: Winter and Summer 2013 as part of a general field campaign.
- Quality control: All values double-checked against field and laboratory notebooks after digitisation.

## Measured variables
- Abundance: total number of individuals per fyke net deployment (per species and per site/quadrat).
- Biomass: total catch wet weight (grams) per fyke net deployment (per species and per site/quadrat).
- Species richness: number of species caught per fyke net deployment.
- Data structure includes per-species abundance (A suffix) and biomass (B suffix) measurements, e.g., Carcinus maenas_A (abundance), Platichthys flesus_B (biomass).

## Location and site details
- Coordinates and site identifiers provided for all locations ( Essex: AH, FW, TM; Morecambe: CS, WS, WP).
- Location descriptors differentiate mudflat characteristics between Essex and Morecambe Bay.

## Data structure and file formats
- Primary file format: Excel workbook.
- Dataset fields include:
  - Row Number, Season (Winter W, Summer S), Location (Morecambe M, Essex E), Site (CS, WS, WP, AH, FW, TM), Habitat (Mudflat MF), Quadrat Number (1–22), Scale (A-D representing 1 m, 1–10 m, 10–100 m, etc.).
  - For each listed species, separate entries for abundance (Number) and biomass (Number, in g) with suffixes _A (abundance) and _B (biomass).
- NA cells indicate missing data.

## Access, reuse, and data quality
- Data are accompanied by site descriptions, sampling details, and species-specific measurement methods to facilitate reuse.
- Quality control carried out by cross-checking against field/lab notebooks after digitisation.
- Clear documentation of units and measurement approach to support integration with other environmental monitoring datasets.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy performance
- Provides a standardized, site-specific baseline of coastal macrofaunal biodiversity, biomass, and species diversity.
- Enables temporal and spatial comparisons within CBESS and with other monitoring datasets.
- Supports assessment of ecosystem service potential linked to macrofaunal communities in mudflat habitats.
- Aligns with aims to verify data quality, enable data sharing, and enhance the value of monitoring datasets through broader data integration.
