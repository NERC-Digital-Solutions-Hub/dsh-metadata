# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) mobile macrofaunal abundance, biomass and species richness from Fyke netting in mudflat habitats.

## Overview
- Dataset capturing abundance, biomass, and species richness of larger mobile macrofauna in mudflat habitats.
- Methods: fyke netting across quadrats; data collected at multiple Essex and Morecambe Bay sites during Winter and Summer 2013 as part of a general field campaign.
- Purpose aligned with environmental health monitoring to inform policy and future decisions.

## Study locations and habitats
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Habitat descriptions:
  - Essex mudflats: protected estuarine sites with cohesive clays, mud, and silt.
  - Morecambe mudflats: dominated by coarse, mobile sediments; greater tidal ranges; more exposed.

## Sampling design and methods
- Target taxa: larger mobile macrofauna; measured by abundance and biomass per fyke net deployment; species richness also recorded.
- Netting apparatus: five double-hoop fyke nets per deployment (mesh size 22 mm; 8 m leader; 0.5 m hoop).
- Deployment: nets positioned at the outer edge of each quadrat; deployed over two tidal cycles; catches processed the following day.
- Data collected: 
  - Abundance (number of individuals per fyke net)
  - Biomass (wet weight in grams, per species)
  - Species richness (number of species per fyke net)
- Season and site identifiers: Winter (W) and Summer (S); locations M (Morecambe) and E (Essex); sites CS, WS, WP (Morecambe) and AH, FW, TM (Essex).

## Data structure and content
- Dataset format: Excel workbook.
- Key fields described:
  - Row Number (sorting index)
  - Season (Winter W or Summer S)
  - Location (Morecambe M or Essex E)
  - Site (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex)
  - Habitat (Mudflat MF)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22)
  - Scale (A: 1 m; B: 1–10 m; C: 10–100 m; D: 100–upper limit)
  - Species columns with suffixes A or B indicating abundance (A) or biomass (B)
  - Examples of species included: Carcinus maenas, Clupea harengus, Crangon crangon, Anguilla anguilla, Pollachius virens, Dicentrarchus labrax, Pomatoschistus sp, Platichthys flesus, Asterias rubens
- Data content per quadrat and deployment: per-species counts (A) and wet-weight biomass (B) when present.
- Metadata notes: NA cells indicate no data; all values double-checked against field/lab notebooks after digitization.

## Data quality, formatting, and governance
- Quality control: data values double-checked with field and laboratory notebooks.
- Data format: Excel workbook with structured, coded fields for location, site, habitat, season, and species measurements.
- Documentation of limitations: None for calibration or statistical treatment; no explicit calibration or statistical analyses described.
- Data accessibility and openness: dataset metadata indicates a standard structure but does not specify public sharing policies beyond the Excel format; data quality and governance considerations noted in general monitoring framework context (data sharing can be a barrier in practice).

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Provides concrete, policy-relevant indicators:
  - Abundance and biomass of key macrofauna in coastal mudflat habitats.
  - Species richness as a measure of biodiversity health.
- Supports trend analysis across seasons and sites (Essex vs. Morecambe Bay) and informs management of estuarine/coastal ecosystems.
- Demonstrates a replicable field protocol and data schema for environmental health monitoring data, including explicit metadata fields for site, habitat, and scale.

## Challenges and considerations for implementation
- Metadata and data standardization: comprehensive field descriptions and coded site/scale identifiers support comparability, but potential inconsistencies (e.g., minor typos in species names) require careful curation.
- Data sharing and governance: barriers related to publicly sharing underlying datasets highlighted in broader monitoring framework aims; this dataset emphasizes open data potential through structured metadata but does not explicitly state sharing status.
- Data gaps and accessibility: NA entries indicate missing data in some cells; ongoing efforts needed to fill gaps and ensure timeliness.
- Communication of results: clear per-quadrat and per-deployment measurements support transparent reporting to stakeholders, though translating complex biodiversity metrics into policy-relevant summaries remains a consideration.
