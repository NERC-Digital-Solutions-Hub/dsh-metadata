# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) mobile macrofaunal abundance, biomass and species richness from Fyke netting in mudflat habitats.

## Overview
- Dataset measuring mobile macrofauna abundance, biomass, and species richness from fyke netting in mudflat habitats as part of CBESS.
- Geographic coverage: Essex and Morecambe Bay mudflats (sediment types differ between regions).
- Field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013.
- Staff responsible: Mark Emmerson.
- Habitat descriptions: Essex mudflats with cohesive clays, mud and silt; Morecambe mudflats with coarser, mobile sediments and greater tidal ranges.
- Data structure includes per-species abundance and biomass, and overall species richness.

## Methods and content
- Sampling method: five double hoop fyke nets (mesh size 22 mm; 8 m leader; 0.5 m hoop) deployed perpendicular to shore at the outer edge of each quadrat; deployed over two executive tidal cycles; catches processed the following day.
- Observed variables: 
  - Abundance (total individuals per fyke net deployment)
  - Biomass (total wet weight in grams per fyke net deployment, by species)
  - Species richness (number of species per fyke net)
- Temporal and spatial structure: data collected across Winter (W) and Summer (S) seasons; sites in Essex (AH, FW, TM) and Morecambe Bay (CS, WS, WP); quadrats numbered 1–22; spatial scales labeled A–D (1–10 m, 10–100 m, etc.).
- Data formatting: Excel workbook; NA cells indicate no data.
- Data quality: values double-checked against field/lab notebooks after digitization.

## Location, habitat, and site details
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM); coordinates provided.
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP); coordinates provided.
- Habitat context:
  - Essex: mudflats with cohesive clays, mud, and silt.
  - Morecambe: mudflats with coarse, mobile sediments; more exposed with larger tidal ranges.

## Data structure and content
- Core measures per fyke net deployment: abundance, biomass (by species), and species richness.
- Site and location coding: Site codes (AH, FW, TM, CS, WS, WP) and location (Essex, Morecambe).
- Species covered (examples): Carcinus maenas, Clupea harengus, Crangon crangon, Anguilla anguilla, Pollachius virens, Dicentrarchus labrax, Pomatoschistus sp., Platichthys flesus, Asterias rubens, among others.
  - Abundance fields labeled with suffix _A; biomass fields labeled with suffix _B.
- Dataset field descriptions provided to support interpretation and reuse, including Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Quadrat Number, Scale, and per-species measurements.

## Data quality, governance, and reuse notes
- Quality control: all values confirmed against field and laboratory notebooks after digitization.
- Documentation: explicit dataset field descriptions included to aid understanding and interoperability.
- Potential considerations for data stewards:
  - Data completeness and presence of separate Pardo field with unclear description.
  - Temporal relevance: dataset corresponds to a single campaign from 2013; consider updates or additional campaigns for ongoing governance.
  - Formatting and interoperability: data stored in an Excel workbook; ensure consistent metadata and, if needed, porting to a metadata-rich data portal.
