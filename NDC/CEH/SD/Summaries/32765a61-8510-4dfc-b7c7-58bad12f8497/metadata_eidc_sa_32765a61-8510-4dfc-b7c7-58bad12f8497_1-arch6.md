# Itogon Landslide Inventory (v11) in WGS84 UTM Zone 51N

- Purpose and scope
  - Inventory of landslide polygons mapped after a typhoon, using satellite imagery and visual evidence of change.
  - Mapping performed in a GIS environment to identify landslide areas for analysis and potential public sharing.
- Data collection and mapping methods
  - Polygons mapped by a single mapper using high- to very high-resolution satellite imagery.
  - Visual observation of pre- and post-typhoon changes used to identify landslides.
  - All measurements and mapping conducted within a Geographic Information System (GIS).
- Temporal coverage
  - Imagery time window: February 2018 to March 2019 (1 year).
  - Analysis and processing conducted January–May 2020.
- Data content and structure
  - Data format: Shapefile bundle consisting of:
    - itogon_inventory_v11_wgs84utm51.shp (main polygon data; 1101 features with FID)
    - itogon_inventory_v11_wgs84utm51.dbf (attribute table)
    - itogon_inventory_v11_wgs84utm51.cpg (UTF-8 encoding)
    - itogon_inventory_v11_wgs84utm51.prj (projection: WGS 1984 / UTM Zone 51N)
    - itogon_inventory_v11_wgs84utm51.shx (spatial indexes)
    - itogon_inventory_v11_wgs84utm51.xml (version/changes metadata)
  - Version: Inventory version 1.0 (XML notes changes/updates between geodatabases and external systems)
- Spatial characteristics
  - Projection: WGS 1984 UTM Zone 51N
  - Polygon count: 1101
  - Polygon areas: 25–120,000 m²
  - Source imagery resolution: 0.5 m to 10 m (high to very high resolution)
- Data quality and validation
  - Post-mapping quality control: independent reviewer conducted quality checks.
- Data provenance and references
  - Location: Itogon (implied by file naming)
  - Documentation includes a metadata file set describing sampling, methods, and data structure
- Notes on use and limitations
  - Mapping relied on a single person; potential for user interpretation variance.
  - Data coverage reflects a specific event period and may be patchy across the region.
  - No sample storage/treatment details provided (N/A).
