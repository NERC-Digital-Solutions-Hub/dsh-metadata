# Metadata

- Overview
  - Inventory of landslide polygons mapped after a typhoon using satellite imagery; polygons mapped by a single mapper via visual evidence of change before/after the event; all measurements performed within a Geographic Information System (GIS).

- Sampling, observation locations, and methods
  - Mapping conducted from high to very high-resolution satellite imagery (0.5 m to 10 m).
  - Detection based on visual interpretation of evidence of change within a defined time window.

- Temporal coverage
  - Imagery window: February 2018 to March 2019.
  - Analysis date: January–May 2020.

- Data scope and scale
  - 1101 polygons representing landslide inventory.
  - Polygon areas range from 25 to 120,000 m².

- Data structure and file format
  - Main dataset stored as shapefile: itogon_inventory_v11_wgs84utm51.* (shp, dbf, prj, shp.xml, shx, cpg, etc.).
  - Attribute data contained in the accompanying .dbf file.
  - Encoding: UTF-8 (described in .cpg).
  - Projection: WGS 1984 UTM Zone 51N.

- Quality control and provenance
  - Inventory independently checked after creation.
  - Version 1.0; .xml file documents changes/updates between geodatabases and external systems.

- SOPs and data collection notes
  - No standard operating procedures (SOPs) available for the techniques used.
  - No physical sample storage; all measurements are GIS-based.

- Reuse notes and governance
  - Dataset is structured for GIS use; explicit versioning and metadata enhance discoverability and provenance.
  - Potential limitations to consider: single mapper, absence of documented SOPs, and reliance on imagery-based interpretation.
