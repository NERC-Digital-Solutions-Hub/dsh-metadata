# CHAR_Jun_Nov_2020_Camera_Trap_Image_Cat alogue_Supporting_Document

- This document describes the CHAR project camera-trap dataset collected in the Ukrainian nuclear exclusion zone after the 1986 Chernobyl incident, focusing on large mammals in 2020 during a period of severe wildfires.
- Study design: three sites (Site 1 northeast, Site 2 western plume, Site 3 south) each covering ~80 km2, using 13 camera traps per site (total images catalogue from setup 1: June–November 2020; deployment extended to Aug 2021 for broader study).
- Camera model and setup: Ltl Acorn 6210MC, PIR-triggered, 940 nm infrared flash, ~0.6–0.7 m above ground, mainly aimed at medium/large mammals, mostly north-facing to reduce sun glare; no bait used.
- Image capture: three-image bursts per triggering event, ~0–1 s between frames, ~2–4 s recovery; new triggering event starts after ~90 s without activity; some fast-moving animals may have been missed.
- Privacy: images containing people or vehicles were catalogued but not included in the dataset to protect privacy; service visits are flagged in the data.

- Data management and QA: images and metadata downloaded November 2020; catalogued by UKCEH staff with quality control by two team members and Chornobyl Center staff; data provided in JPEG images and Excel files; consistent naming and folder structure documented.

- Outputs and usage: a comprehensive image catalogue enabling self-served analysis of species presence, counts, and event-based activity; suitable for cross-site comparisons and temporal patterns, with accompanying site descriptions and deployment details to support contextual analyses.

- Data scope and files (Setup 1, June–November 2020):
  - Image catalogue and metadata describing each image, including species, counts, triggering events, and notes.
  - Site descriptions with camera locations, coordinates (WGS84), habitat notes, ambient dose rates, deployment dates, and duration.
  - Camera details and image summaries including serial numbers, folder paths, start/end deployment times, and image totals.
  - Private/public considerations: images with people/vehicles excluded from the dataset to protect privacy; disturbance caused by human presence is flagged in metadata.
