# Topographic survey conducted at the Rigg Foot plot, Sourhope

## Overview
- Purpose: Topographic survey of the Rigg Foot plot, Sourhope.
- Team: Mick Whelan and Stuart Bradley, Department of Environmental Science, University of Stirling.
- Dates: April 4–6, 2000 and May 11–12, 2000.

## Methods and data products
- Instrument: Leica Geosystems Total Station EDM.
- Data processing: Interpolation and contouring performed using Liscad Plus Surveying and Engineering Environment v4.0.
- Data captured and indicated on maps:
  - Treatment boundary (+)
  - Sub-plot marker pegs (-); some peg locations may be missing if the peg was difficult to locate
  - Smaller dots: individual survey points that will be removed from definitive versions
- Spatial reference: Superimposed grid with 0.5 m cells to approximate sample point locations.
- Sample points: Identified by numbers 01–40, with at least one gap in the sequence (e.g., 31 appears absent).

## Data quality and notes
- Potential gaps where peg locations are missing due to locating difficulty.
- Distinction between temporary survey points and elements to be retained in definitive outputs, indicating a data cleaning/versioning step.

## Data governance considerations for Data Leaders
- Ensure clear documentation of field tools, dates, and processing software to support reproducibility.
- Maintain separation between temporary survey observations and final, publishable data products.
- Plan for versioned data outputs (field records vs. definitive datasets) and metadata about markers, boundaries, and sample points.
