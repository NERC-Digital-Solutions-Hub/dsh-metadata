# Topographic survey conducted at the Rigg Foot plot, Sourhope

- Overview
  - Purpose: Topographic survey of the Rigg Foot plot in Sourhope.
  - Dates: April 4–6, 2000 and May 11–12, 2000.
  - Researchers: Mick Whelan and Stuart Bradley, Department of Environmental Science, University of Stirling.
  - Instruments and processing: Leica Geosystems Total Station EDM; interpolation and contouring with Liscad Plus Surveying and Engineering Environment v4.0.

- Data content and structure
  - Features and annotations:
    - + Treatment boundary
    - -  Sub-plot marker peg (some peg locations may be missing if peg was not easy to locate)
    - - Smaller dots: individual survey points (will be removed from definitive versions)
  - Grid and sampling:
    - NB: Overlaid grid with 0.5 m cells to allow approximate location of sample points.
  - Identifiers: Points labeled 01–40, with 31 not shown in the provided sequence (01–30 and 32–40 are listed).
  - Definitive versions: Smaller dots indicating survey points are temporary and will be removed in final releases.

- Provenance and processing
  - Field collection conducted over two sessions in 2000.
  - Data processed through interpolation and contouring software to produce the topographic surface.

- Data quality and limitations (governance implications)
  - Potential gaps: some sub-plot peg locations may be missing or hard to locate.
  - Non-interpolated points: temporary survey points will be removed in final versions, affecting reproducibility between versions.
  - Approximate sampling: use of a 0.5 m grid provides approximate locations rather than exact point-by-point measurements in the final dataset.
  - Missing metadata in this summary: coordinate reference system, datum, and units are not specified here and should be captured in accompanying metadata for reuse.

- Metadata and governance considerations for Data Stewards
  - Documented provenance: creators, dates, instruments, and software used.
  - Data lineage: distinction between field observations and final, publishable dataset.
  - Versioning plan: clearly distinguish interim vs. definitive versions; plan for updating with removal of temporary markers.
  - Metadata enhancements to capture: spatial reference (coordinate system, datum, projection), measurement uncertainties, data collection methods, and a data dictionary for feature types (boundary, pegs, survey points).
  - Access and reuse: specify licensing, access restrictions (if any), and recommended citation.

- Potential uses and reuse considerations
  - Useful for historical topography, boundary delineation, and environmental analyses within the plot.
  - Users should be aware of potential incomplete peg locations and the existence of temporary survey points that may be absent in finalized datasets.
