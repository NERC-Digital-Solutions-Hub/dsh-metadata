  - Outputs include species totals per plot and occurrences for dominant species; data show diverse herb and grass species with varying presence across plots.
  - Data capture supports linkage to soil properties for vegetation-soil relationships.

- Ecotron soil site (Block 5 context)
  - Included as a comparative component with linked soil analysis and vegetation data to support longer-term ecological experimentation.

- Data management and provenance (as context across blocks)
  - Barcoded sample tracking (MLURI barcodes) used to maintain traceability from field collection through laboratory analysis.
  - Data are organized by blocks, horizons, and sample types (profile vs auger vs ecotron), with metadata captured in laboratory records.
  - Documentation and appendices (e.g., Twinspan, associations analyses) referenced for community and soil-chemical data interpretation.
  - Archiving at -80°C for soil samples and integration into MLURI/CEH data systems.

- Practical takeaways for data stewardship
  - Enforce a consistent data model across blocks: uniform horizon naming, measurement units, and sample identifiers.
  - Preserve complete provenance: capture collection metadata, barcodes, QA steps, and data lineage from field to analysis.
  - Maintain robust archiving workflows: physical samples (-80°C), digital datasets, and clear metadata linking blocks, horizons, and sample events.
  - Document data limitations and coverage: note incomplete horizons or blocks with anomalous site characteristics to guide interpretation.
  - Link datasets (vegetation and soil) at the block- and horizon-level to enable integrated analyses and long-term ecological insights.

- Appendix and datasets reference (high-level)
  - Block-level soil and vegetation data for Blocks 1–3 (and partial coverage for Blocks 4–5) with horizon- and plot-level metrics.
  - Key datasets and references include: Twinspan documents, Association datasets, and Soil Ecology datasets produced by MLURI and CEH collaboration.
  - Appendices provide block-wise data tables, site details, horizon descriptions, and corresponding measurements.

- Overall implications
  - The Block 4 (and adjacent Block 5) datasets provide a comprehensive, multi-faceted view of soil-vegetation interactions at Sourhope, suitable for long-term ecological analyses, while illustrating the importance of rigorous data governance and provenance for reuse by researchers and networks such as ECN/SERAD Micronet.
