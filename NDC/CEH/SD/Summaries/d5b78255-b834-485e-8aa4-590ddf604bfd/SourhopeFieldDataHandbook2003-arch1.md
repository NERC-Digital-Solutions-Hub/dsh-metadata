# Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003

## Overview and Context
- Documents soil and vegetation data from Sourhope Field Site (Rigg Foot, Blocks 4 and 5) to relate soil properties, moisture regimes, and plant communities under long-term perturbations and ECN coordination.
- Includes detailed soil profiles, horizon descriptions, chemical/audit data, auger samples, vegetation surveys, and Ecotron/ECN contextual data.
- Data are intended for cross-site comparisons, data sharing with metadata, and informing interpretation of grassland responses to management and environmental change.

## Site and Sampling Design
- Location: Rigg Foot, Sourhope; Block 4 and Block 5 sites within Sourhope, with altitudes around 309–315 m; grid reference for Block 5: NT8544019520.
- Site characteristics: Imperfect drainage in Block 5; soils described as Brown forest soils with gleying; largely igneous-derived parent materials; bedrock tendencies include undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
- Layout and sampling:
  - Block 4: Profiles and auger cores across multiple horizons (0–95 cm+ in various horizons: LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx).
  - Block 5: Deeper horizon sequence (LF to Cg) with horizon-specific sampling.
  - Auger sampling: Series 4A–4F (Block 4) and 5A–5F (Block 5) for detailed horizon-level chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2).
  - Vegetation: Plot-level surveys (e.g., 4A–4F in Block 4; multiple subplots per plot) capturing species presence/absence andTotals per subplot/plot.
  - Ecotron component: Separate, dedicated soil analyses and vegetation surveys for Ecotron plots, enabling controlled perturbation comparisons.

## Block 4: Soil Profile, Analysis, and Vegetation
- Soil profile and horizons:
  - LF (0–1 cm): Fibrous, moist; no mineral grains; smooth boundary.
  - FH (1–4 cm): Fibrous, moist; abundant fine roots; sharp boundary.
  - H (4–8 cm): Black, moist; amorphous; fibrous roots; sharp boundary.
  - Ah (8–29 cm): Dark reddish brown, sandy silt loam; friable; many roots; contains igneous stones; sharp boundary.
  - Abg (29–40 cm): Pinkish grey to brown mottling; coarse sandy silt loam with stones; sharp boundary.
  - B sg (40–61 cm): Brown, structured; igneous stones present; moist; firm.
  - C gx (61–95 cm): Reddish brown; sandy clay loam; distinct mottles; massive to platy structure.
- Soil chemical/physical properties (selected highlights):
  - Overall acidity: pH(H2O) ~ 4.76–5.02; pH(CaCl2) ~ 3.88–4.19 in measured horizons.
  - Organic content indicators: %Moisture loss and LOI show very high organic content in shallow horizons (e.g., LOI up to ~73% in FH; Ah and AB also elevated but lower than surface horizons).
  - Carbon and nitrogen: %N ~0.42–2.14 across horizons; %C ~6.41–38.12 (noting FH often shows higher %C in some horizons); C:N ratios commonly in the 12–20 range.
  - Base cations: Ca and Mg present with varying meq/100 g; Ca often higher in upper horizons (e.g., FH Ca ~10.05 meq/100 g); Mg ranges ~3–5 meq/100 g in several horizons.
  - Other elements: K and Na present in smaller amounts; Na frequently low; moisture loss values vary by horizon.
- Vegetation association (within Block 4 plots, e.g., 4A–4F):
  - Dominant grasses generally include Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta with Poa pratensis and other forbs also present.
  - Community patterns identified: primary Festuca ovina–Agrostis capillaris–Galium saxatile (U4d) grassland with Luzula multiflora–Rhytidiadelphus loreus subcommunity; moister variants (Nardus stricta–Galium saxatile, U5b) in blocks 4–5; edge plots frequently host Deschampsia flexuosa; interior zones show broader distribution of typical upland grasses.
  - Species richness increases downslope; edge vs interior microhabitat effects observed on species distribution.
- Data notes:
  - Vegetation results are partly based on subsampled subplots; described as descriptive/indicative due to subset sampling.
  - Interpretations link vegetation patterns to soil properties and moisture gradients.

## Block 5: Soil Profile, Analysis, and Vegetation
- Soil profile and horizons:
  - LF (0–1 cm): Fibrous; moist; no stones; smooth boundary.
  - FH (1–5 cm): Fibrous/semi-fibrous; roots abundant; smooth boundary.
  - H (5–7 cm): Black, moist; angular blocky structure.
  - Ah (7–25 cm): Very dark brown; sandy silt loam; friable; extensive roots; many andesite stones.
  - AB (25–35 cm): Grey; coarse sandy silt loam; friable; abundant fine roots.
  - Bg (35–49 cm) and BCg (49–70 cm): Mottled horizons; red/yellow mottling; clay loam to clayey textures; abundant small stones.
  - Cg (70–100 cm): Light reddish brown; clay loam; massive structure; very abundant igneous stones.
- Soil chemical/physical properties (highlights):
  - pH: H2O typically around 4.4–5.2; CaCl2 generally between 3.6–4.4 (varies by horizon).
  - Organic matter and LOI: LOI values in Ah and deeper horizons indicate substantial organic content, with LOI ranging roughly 40–70% in upper horizons depending on horizon and sub-layer.
  - Total carbon and nitrogen: %N often ~0.6–2.2; %C frequently ~9–33% in surface horizons (Ah/H), declining with depth.
  - Base cations: Ca and Mg present with notable values in Ah and Ah-like horizons; Ca often >6–12 meq/100 g in shallower horizons; Mg values generally 1–5 meq/100 g deeper down.
  - Moisture and ignition: %Moisture loss and %Loss on Ignition vary by horizon, consistent with organic-rich upper horizons and increasing mineral content with depth.
- Auger samples (Block 5, 5A–5F):
  - N ~0.53–0.62%; C ~7.01–9.07%; C:N ~12.62–14.74.
  - Ca (meq/100 g) ~1.01–5.08; Mg ~0.58–3.50; K ~0.58–0.83; Na typically very low.
  - pH(H2O) ~4.45–4.95; pH CaCl2 ~3.53–4.14.
  - LOI ~14–20% across auger samples; %Moisture loss ~2.97–9.43% depending on horizon.
- Vegetation (Block 5 plots):
  - Similar upland grassland assemblages as Block 4 with plot-level species totals ranging across plots; community patterns driven by microhabitat moisture and soil chemistry, with consistent presence of grasses and forbs typical of upland acid soils.
  - Subplot-level totals indicate variable species richness across plots, reflecting fine-scale habitat heterogeneity.

## ECOTRON SOIL SITE
- ECOTRON Plot soil (Block 4/ECOTRON context):
  - Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76 meq/100 g; Mg 1.7; K 0.62; Na 0.15; %Moisture loss 4.79; %LOI 17.42; pH(H2O) 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82.
- ECOTRON vegetation data:
  - Plot-level species counts indicate a limited but characteristic assemblage consistent with Ecotron-aligned grassland communities; supports comparisons under controlled perturbations.

## Data Management and Analysis Context
- Data are organized with horizon-specific soil and plot-level vegetation data, including multiple tables and appendices; long-term archiving (including -80°C samples) and metadata alignment with Sourhope ECN/Micronet programs.
- Analyses emphasize cross-site comparisons, linkages between soil properties (pH, C/N, LOI, Ca/Mg/K) and vegetation patterns, and interpretation of how moisture and substrate influence community composition.
- Limitations acknowledged:
  - Vegetation results for Block 4 and Block 5 are partly based on sampled subplots; some plots show anomalous soil responses requiring cautious interpretation.
  - Data support long-term understanding of grassland responses to impediments and management, rather than a single-plot definitive inference.

## Key Findings and Implications
- Soils at Rigg Foot are acidic with substantial organic matter in surface horizons; Ah and AB horizons show notable stone content and mixed mineralogy, consistent with igneous parent material.
- Vegetation communities align with moisture and soil property gradients; primary upland grassland community is Festuca ovina–Agrostis capillaris–Galium saxatile (U4d) with Luzula and Rhytidiadelphus associations; moister variants (U5b) appear in Block 4–5.
- Edge effects and microhabitat variation influence species distributions, with Deschampsia flexuosa more common at edges and interior plots supporting broader grasses.
- ECOTRON data provide baseline comparisons for controlled perturbations, supporting future analyses of how soil chemistry and moisture mediate vegetation responses under management or climate-related changes.
