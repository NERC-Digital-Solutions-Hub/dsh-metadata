# DATA GOVERNANCE, QUALITY, AND LEADERSHIP IMPLICATIONS

- Data system architecture:
  - Multilayer data ecosystem: plot-level treatments, subplots, horizon-scale soil data, complete vegetation inventories, and long-term archives.
  - Integration with broader networks (ECN, Micronet) and centralized repositories to enable discoverability and cross-site analyses.
- Data quality and standards:
  - Rich metadata and detailed tabular outputs (horizon codes, chemical variables, pH metrics, LOI, moisture loss, species inventories).
  - The breadth of data types (soil profiles, auger samples, vegetation surveys) highlights the need for harmonized metadata schemas and data dictionaries to facilitate cross-site synthesis and re-use.
- User needs and co-ownership:
  - Outputs include soil profiles, horizon descriptions, horizon-wise chemical data, vegetation inventories, and plot classifications (NVC-equivalents), useful for soil science, ecology, agronomy, and policy-related activities.
  - Design supports collaborative use across soil scientists, ecologists, data managers, and researchers within ECN and partner networks.
- Gaps and opportunities for data leadership:
  - Opportunities to align data schemas with other ECN sites, establish centralized metadata registries, enable versioning and provenance tracking, and formalize external data access protocols.
  - Potential to extend longitudinal treatment-effect data, enhance replication, and standardize metrics for improved cross-site comparability.
- Accessibility and archiving:
  - Archival storage of samples and long-term data storage in institutional repositories; links to BC-level data programs (ECN, Micronet) for cross-site comparisons and longitudinal studies.
