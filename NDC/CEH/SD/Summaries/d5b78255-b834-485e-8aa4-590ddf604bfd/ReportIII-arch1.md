# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Field experiment at Sourhope, Scotland, under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Purpose: monitor a broad set of variables to contextualise detailed studies; compare across years and treatments.
  - Experimental design includes six main treatments: Control 1 (C1), Control 2 (C2), Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), and Biocide (B).
  - Key measurements: Above-ground biomass, soil pH (top 5 cm), botanical composition (Point Quadrat survey), and automatic weather data. Data collected 1998–2001; comprehensive 2001 sampling and analyses reported.

- Introduction highlights
  - Site management described, including periodic sampling and a shift in site personnel in 2001.
  - Two notable 2001 events: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limiting access Feb–May; changes in site officer.
  - Baseline context and data collection schedule referenced (Table 1).

- Results
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather overall unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after a very wet 2000 year.
    - Radiation similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than prior years.
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Across treatments, biomass followed a consistent hierarchy with peak production in July–August.
    - 2001 showed a substantial rise in biomass vs. previous years, likely due to staff changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Biomass normalized to C1 showed nitrogen and/or lime treatments most beneficial; significant treatment effects (improved plots vs. non-improved) and a significant year-by-treatment interaction; blocks not significant.
  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime addition raised surface soil pH; by Oct 2001: limed plots ~6.19 and N&L plots ~6.38.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent; control plots remained near baseline.
  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 point quadrat survey replicated 2000 protocol; surveyors’ results not significantly different.
    - 2001 hits were 58% higher than 2000 across all treatments, indicating greater sward density (likely due to grazing removal since 1998).
    - Treatment differences in dominant species:
      - Agrostis capillaris most abundant in 2000, declined in 2001 across treatments (except Control 1 and Limed plots).
      - Festuca spp. increased across all treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen (Festuca ovina) and Nitrogen& Lime (Festuca rubra) plots.
      - Improved plots (N and/or L) favored Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in untreated controls.
    - Species richness: unimproved plots harbored 24 species; improved N&L plots had 18 species, suggesting a possible early diversity decline with strong fertility improvements.
    - Multivariate pattern: PCA separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; improved plots showed more extreme scores with higher contact with Festuca rubra and related species.
    - Biomass vs. species abundance: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis tended to decline as biomass increased.
    - Litter increase observed in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, reflecting faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

- Site heterogeneity
  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) tended to be more acidic; underlying pattern partially linked to plot type distribution (more Controls/Biocide in some columns).
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass varied by location; central plots often exhibited higher biomass (e.g., N&L 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant biomass difference between blocks (statistical note: ANOVA results provided in text).

- Additional notes
  - Appendix and tables provide detailed annual biomass values, ANOVA results, and species abundance rankings.

- Takeaways for data-informed interpretation
  - Fertiliser-related treatments (Nitrogen and Lime, individually or combined) consistently boosted above-ground biomass and altered soil chemistry (pH), with clear interactions across years.
  - Botanical composition shifted toward species associated with higher fertility (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) in improved plots; native/less fertile species persisted more in unimproved plots.
  - Biomass and pH are positively linked; spatial heterogeneity influences biomass distribution across the site.
  - Data handling approaches (ANOVA, PCA) support robust interpretation of treatment effects, inter-year dynamics, and multivariate plant community responses.
