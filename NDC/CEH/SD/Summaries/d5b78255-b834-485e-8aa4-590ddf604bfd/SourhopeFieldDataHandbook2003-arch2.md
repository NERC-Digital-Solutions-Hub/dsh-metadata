## Block 4: Soil Analysis of Rigg Foot, Sourhope: Block 4 Auger Samples

- Samples 4A–4F provide soil chemical and physical properties from auger cores (0–30 cm) and related horizons.
- Key ranges (4A–4F):
  - %N: 0.51–0.58
  - %C: 6.80–8.02
  - C:N: 12.62–14.26
  - Ca (meq/100 g): 1.01–2.96
  - Na (meq/100 g): 0.12–0.15
  - K (meq/100 g): 0.58–0.81
  - Mg (meq/100 g): 0.58–1.59
  - %Moisture loss: 4.29–5.15
  - %Loss on Ignition: 14.60–17.96
  - pH(H2O): 4.45–4.82
  - pH(CaCl2): 3.64–4.05
- General interpretation:
  - Soils are acidic with relatively low base cations; organic matter (LOI) moderate to high in surface horizons.
  - C and N contents show typical upland soil organic layers; C:N ratios indicate substantial organic matter.
- Vegetation survey (Plot 4A, 4B, 4C, from Block 4):
  - Vegetation sampled in subplots using point quadrats; data compiled as presence/absence (and totals by subplot/plot).
  - Dominant/detected taxa and community patterns align with upland grassland/moorland assemblages; results support later classification and association analyses (e.g., NVC-style groupings and indicator species).
  - Data structure suggests clear block- and slope-position effects on species composition.

## Block 5: Soil and Vegetation Data

- (a) Site details (Block 5):
  - Grid reference: NT8544019520; Altitude: 315 m; Slope ~5°; Imperfect drainage.
  - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; Parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
- (b) Soil profile (Block 5):
  - Depths and horizons described from 0–100 cm: FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg.
  - Horizon descriptions indicate a well-developed, mottled, stone-rich profile with textures ranging from sandy silt loam (Ah) to clay loam (Cg); strong mottling and blocky structures in some horizons.
- (c) Soil analysis (Block 5) – profile-wide:
  - Across horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg: %N and %C vary with depth; C:N ratios commonly in the mid-teens.
  - Ca, Mg, K, and other cations present with horizon-dependent variation; Na generally low or not reported in all horizons.
  - %Moisture loss and %LOI show substantial organic matter in surface horizons, decreasing with depth.
  - pH(H2O) typically in the acidic range (approximately 4.3–5.2); pH(CaCl2) slightly lower.
- (d) Auger samples (Block 5): Analysis of auger samples 5A–5F:
  - %N: ~0.53–0.62
  - %C: ~7.01–9.07
  - C:N: ~10.20–14.74
  - Ca (meq/100 g): ~0.35–5.08
  - Na (meq/100 g): mostly ~0.12–0.17
  - K (meq/100 g): ~0.59–0.83
  - Mg (meq/100 g): ~0.58–3.50
  - %Moisture loss: ~2.79–9.43
  - %Loss on Ignition: ~4.83–67.00
  - pH(H2O): ~3.53–5.20
  - pH(CaCl2): ~3.53–4.48
- (e) Vegetation survey (Block 5) – plots 5A–5F:
  - Subplots and species totals recorded; data show varying species richness and composition by plot, consistent with upland grassland and moorland vegetation gradients.
  - Across plots, presence of common upland grasses and forbs; variation reflects microhabitat differences and soil profile characteristics.
- Key context for monitoring:
  - Block 5 data provide complementary soil-plant information to Block 4, enabling assessment of vertical soil gradients and their influence on vegetation community structure over time.
  - Data formats align with long-term monitoring goals: standardized soil chemistry, profile descriptions, and vegetation inventories suitable for multivariate analyses and trend detection.

## ECOTRON PLOT

- (a) Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT 1):
  - Wt: 6.089 mg
  - %N: 0.59
  - %C: 8.22
  - C:N: 13.83
  - Ca: 2.76 meq/100 g
  - Na: 0.15 meq/100 g
  - K: 0.62 meq/100 g
  - Mg: 1.70 meq/100 g
  - %Moisture loss: 4.79
  - %Loss on Ignition: 17.42
  - pH(H2O): 4.79
  - pH(CaCl2): 3.82
- (b) Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT):
  - Subplots A–F with presence/absence and species totals; data indicate typical ECN-like plant communities under controlled conditions.
  - Counts reflect community structure across subplots, enabling comparison with non-ecotron plots and assessment of treatment effects.

## Data management and monitoring relevance

- The augmented data from Block 4, Block 5, and ECOTRON plots feed into standardized formats (chemistry, moisture, LOI, pH; horizon descriptions; vegetation presence/absence with totals).
- Outputs support long-term monitoring of soil health, vegetation responses, and ecosystem change by providing consistent, comparable datasets across plots, blocks, and transects.
- The data are organized to facilitate mapping, statistical analyses (e.g., Twinspan, NVC classification, association analyses), and accessibility for policy-relevant environmental health evaluation.
