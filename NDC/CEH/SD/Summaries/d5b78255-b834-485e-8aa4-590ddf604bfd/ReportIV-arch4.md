# SUMMARY

## Context and aims
- Four-year summary of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope site, focusing on understanding soil biodiversity and the functional roles of soil organisms, linked to above-ground plant communities.
- Large, multi-project field experiment with five replicate blocks and multiple treatments to study mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and lime), and insecticide effects on plant productivity and diversity, with ongoing data collection since 1999.
- Data collected span above-ground biomass, species composition and abundance, soil chemistry and moisture, weather, and detailed plant community surveys; results feed into cross-project insights about soil-plant interactions and functional types (CSR framework).

## Site management and treatments
- Treatments include: Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Insecticide (formerly Biocide) applied after mowing.
- Management regime: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept); insecticide application on the insecticide plots; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime on designated plots.
- Experimental design: 5 blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m2 cells used for data collection; site activity includes Phase I (1998–2001) and Phase II (2002) projects.
- Data collection framework includes weather data, above-ground biomass estimates, baseline and subsequent plant surveys, soil pH measurements, soil moisture readings, and bryophyte assessments.

## Data collection and management overview
- Weather: continuous atmospheric and soil data via on-site Automatic Weather Station; 1999–2002 data with noted anomalies in 2002 due to station malfunction (some data substituted from Konza station).
- Above-ground productivity: annual biomass estimates from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots, collected prior to each mowing; samples oven-dried and weighed.
- Baselining and tracking: initial 1998 baseline survey; annual/periodic point analysis surveys in 2000–2002 using 0.5 m2 cells and 100-point grid to identify species presence at fine scales.
- Additional measurements: soil pH at multiple depths, soil moisture (theta probe), bryophyte identification, and various small-scale botanical surveys.
- Data products and appendices: detailed species lists, site activity summaries, weather summaries, biomass data by plot, rank analyses, and point-analysis results (Appendices 1–8).

## Key findings by topic

- Biomass productivity and treatment effects
  - Long-term trend: increasing above-ground biomass across all treatments from 1999 onward.
  - 2002 results: overall biomass production fell compared to 2001 across many treatments; the most productive plots remain those with both nitrogen and lime.
  - Spatial pattern: lower productivity on the lower slope blocks; notable reductions in Control 2 plots in 2002.
  - Statistical support: significant effects of Treatment, Year, and Treatment × Year interactions on biomass.

- Mowing effects on plant communities
  - Dominant species shift: decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis (over 40% since 2000); Festuca rubra expansion, especially in more fertile (N and/or Lime) plots.
  - Bryophyte expansion: mosses increase across the site, likely aided by a ~6 cm mowing height and cessation of grazing, contributing to higher bryophyte relative abundance.
  - Implications: mowing creates a more uniform disturbance regime that favors stress-tolerant and moss-dominated communities, with reduced diversity in nutrient-rich plots due to competitive exclusion.

- Fertilisation effects
  - Productivity boost: nitrogen and/or lime consistently increase above-ground biomass; plots with both nitrogen and lime show the strongest productivity.
  - Soil chemistry: liming elevates soil pH toward ~7.0 in upper soil layers; high lime application may reduce moisture and potentially cause stress or chlorosis in some cases.
  - Relationship with pH and moisture: positive overall link between soil pH and biomass across treatments; the relationship weakens or reverses in plots with combined N and lime, suggesting moisture stress or high pH effects.
  - Functional-group shifts: C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species expand in N+L plots; stress-tolerant species persist in unimproved plots.

- Insecticide effects
  - Diversity signals: observations consistent with known insect-plant interaction literature; reduced herbivory may allow more palatable species to persist, potentially supporting higher diversity, but evidence is cautious and not definitive.
  - Management implications: insecticide effects on plant community composition appear context-dependent and align with broader insect-plant interaction theory.

- Trampling and 13CO2 pulse experiments
  - Trampling in C2 plots likely suppressed vegetation growth, contributing to observed productivity declines relative to C1 plots during intense experimental activity periods.

- Bryophytes and habitat structure
  - Bryophyte dominance increased markedly (19.92% of total hits in 2002 vs 10.82% in 2001; 6.5% in 2000).
  - Greater bryophyte abundance particularly in unimproved plots; linked to sward structure, disturbance regime, and moisture conditions.
  - Litter and moss dynamics show treatment-dependent shifts over 2000–2002.

- Point analysis and species diversity
  - Taxa and functional groups: two grass species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) dominate improved plots; Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum more common in unimproved plots.
  - Community structure: PCA reveals clear separation between improved and unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster distinctly; nitrogen-treated samples show mixed affinities, some resembling lime plots.
  - Bryophytes and litter: bryophyte hits increase across years; litter abundance shows treatment-related differences emerging in 2001–2002.
  - Functional group composition: three dominant groups (stress-tolerators S, CSR, SR/CSR) account for the majority of live plant hits; by 2002, treatments show significant differences in the distribution of these groups, with N+L favoring CSR/SR-C S-R and unimproved plots favoring S.

- Diversity indices (Shannon) and responses
  - Baseline diversity differences were not present; after 2000, treatment differences emerged, strengthening through 2001 and 2002.
  - 2002: Shannon diversity index declined by 15% in N+L plots compared with increases in other treatments (up to 29% in some insecticide plots).

## Data governance and quality notes
- Longitudinal, multi-treatment data with yearly measurements and cross-year comparability.
- Data sources and formats are documented in appendices; full datasets and species lists are available via project appendices and Soil Biodiversity site resources.
- 2002 weather data gaps due to a station malfunction; Konza station data substituted for missing intervals; some missing weeks of data affect nutrient–moisture–productivity interpretation.
- Rich metadata available for site layout, plot treatments, sampling protocols, and analysis methods (including ANOVA, PCA, and CSR classification).

## Implications for data strategy and leadership
- Strengths for data leadership:
  - Robust, multi-year, multi-factor experimental design enabling cross-cutting analyses of production, diversity, and functional traits.
  - Rich, multi-source data ecosystem (biomass, species hits, bryophytes, soil chemistry, moisture, weather, litter) with clear metadata references and appendices.
  - Ability to connect above- and below-ground processes through integrated data streams, supporting data-driven strategy for data strategy and sharing across networks.
- Considerations for data governance and scale:
  - Ensure consistent, harmonised metadata standards across years, blocks, plots, and subplots for discoverability and reuse.
  - Maintain versioned data pipelines to handle missing data periods and documentation of data substitutions (e.g., 2002 weather data).
  - Promote cross-project data sharing and integration to support broader soil-biodiversity and ecosystem-function analyses across partners and sites.
  - Leverage long-term datasets to inform policy-relevant insights about nutrient management, disturbance regimes, and biodiversity maintenance.
