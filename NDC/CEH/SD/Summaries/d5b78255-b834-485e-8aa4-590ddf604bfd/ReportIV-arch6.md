# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report

## Overview
- Four years of intensive study at the Sourhope field site as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Focus on linking below-ground soil biodiversity with above-ground plant communities, monitored via above-ground biomass (productivity), species composition, and relative abundance (diversity).
- Site previously grazed by sheep; from 1998 onward fenced off from all grazing; management includes regular mowing and prescribed treatments.

## Methods

- Location and design
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope environmental gradient.
  - Each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated randomly.
  - 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells used for data collection; five mowing events per year from May to September.

- Treatments (plot-level)
  - Control 1: No treatment
  - Control 2: No treatment
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Lime (CaCO3)
  - Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4, applied after mowing)

- Data collection and activities
  - Weather: On-site Automatic Weather Station (since 1999)
  - Above-ground productivity: 0.5 m2 cell samples per plot, collected prior to each mow; dried and weighed
  - Baseline vegetation survey: 0.5 m2 quadrats (July 1998); subsequent annual point analyses (2000–2002)
  - Soil monitoring: soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe, various years)
  - Additional small-scale botanical surveys, biomass sorting, and species lists (Appendices provided)

- Research group activity
  - Phase I projects largely finished by 2002; Phase II ongoing with field campaigns including labelled CO2 pulses and gas measurements.

## Key Findings at a Glance

- Biomass productivity
  - Long-term increase in biomass across all treatments since 1999, with the highest productivity in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.
  - 2002 biomass was generally lower than 2001, with declines ranging from ~14% (N&L) to ~31% (Control 2).
  - Fertilised plots (N and/or lime) showed stronger productivity gains, though some signs of potential peak or stress in highly fertilised plots (e.g., near-neutral pH, drier conditions).

- Soil chemistry and moisture
  - Lime raised soil pH significantly; upper soil around pH 7.0 in limed plots by 2002.
  - Nitrogen had a smaller positive effect on pH.
  - A strong negative correlation between soil moisture and soil pH (r ≈ -0.68).
  - Positive association between higher soil pH and above-ground productivity in aggregate; treatment-level differences modulated by moisture.

- Plant community composition and diversity
  - Dominant grasses shift with treatments:
    - Festuca rubra expands in fertile (N and/or Lime) plots.
    - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline across treatments, with mowing implicated as a key, site-wide factor.
  - Bryophyte expansion observed across the site, especially in unimproved plots; mosses and liverworts contribute a notable fraction of hits and biomass, increasingly so over time.
  - Point Analysis revealed treatment-specific shifts:
    - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) show higher hits for Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots show higher Bryophyte presence.
  - Shannon Diversity Index:
    - Diversity declined in Nitrogen & Lime plots (2002 index down ~15% vs baseline), while other treatments showed increases (up to ~29% in Insecticide plots).

- Functional types (CSR framework)
  - Three main functional groups: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (C-S-R), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR).
  - By 2002, SR/CSR and C-S-R groups became more prominent in fertilised plots; stress-tolerators increased in unimproved plots.
  - Across years, C-S-R and SR/CSR groups expanded in nitrogen and lime plots; stress-tolerant species favored unimproved plots.

- Insecticide and trampling effects
  - Insecticide (Dursban) results on diversity are ambiguous; possible link to higher diversity in some contexts but not conclusive due to limited mechanistic data.
  - Trampling effects largely observed in newly surveyed C2 (Insecticide/Nitrogen/Lime) plots during intense 13CO2 pulse activities, contributing to reduced productivity in that block.

## By-Treatment Interpretations

- Mowing effect
  - Regular mowing around 6 cm height, with no grazing, appears to reduce Agrostis spp. and promote Festuca rubra, especially in fertile plots.
  - General shift toward stress-tolerant species across non-fertilised plots due to reduced disturbance and nutrient loss through cuttings.

- Fertilisation effect
  - Nitrogen and lime improve biomass production; combined N&L yields the strongest productivity.
  - Excess lime raises pH toward 7.0, which may eventually reduce productivity if moisture stress increases or pH continues to rise; potential chlorosis observed in heavily limed plots.
  - Elevated pH benefits C-S-R and related functional groups; however, extreme lime applications may alter moisture, stress dynamics, and plant physiology.

- Insecticide effect
  - Possible enhancement of certain palatable species through reduced herbivory, potentially increasing diversity in some plots, but evidence remains circumstantial.

- Trampling effect
  - 2002 C2-stage surveys suggest trampling during CO2 pulse activities suppressed vegetation growth, contributing to observed productivity declines in some plots.

## Data and Analyses Highlights

- Biomass data
  - Positive long-term trend in biomass across treatments since 1999; 2002 shows decreases but remains above 1999 levels for most plots.
  - Block position on slope influenced productivity: lower parts (e.g., Block 1) showed greater increases in some years earlier, while Block 5 showed declines.

- Statistical findings
  - Split-plot ANOVA indicates significant treatment effects on biomass and significant Year and Treatment×Year interactions.
  - PCA of point analysis data demonstrates clear separation between improved (fertilised) vs unimproved plots, with nitrogen-treated samples sometimes clustering near limed plots.

- Biodiversity metrics
  - Shannon diversity declined in Nitrogen & Lime plots by 2002, while other treatments increased diversity to varying extents.
  - Bryophyte hits increased across years, notably in unimproved plots, contributing to overall shifts in plant community structure.

- Appendices and datasets
  - Detailed species lists, biomass per plot, rank abundances, bryophyte records, and weather data provided for deeper analysis.

## Conclusions

- The Sourhope site demonstrates clear links between management practices and above- and below-ground ecosystem responses.
- Fertilisation (especially N+L) enhances productivity but may reduce diversity over time and shift community structure toward competitive, high-nutrient taxa.
- Removing grazing (via mowing) generally promotes stress-tolerant and bryophyte species, reducing certain grasses and altering overall productivity depending on moisture regimes.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but not definitively established; trampling during experimental campaigns can markedly affect productivity on specific plots.
- The system shows dynamic interactions among soil chemistry (notably pH and moisture), light competition, and plant functional types, with implications for balancing productivity and biodiversity in managed grasslands.
