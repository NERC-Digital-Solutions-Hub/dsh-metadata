# Topographic survey conducted at the Rigg Foot plot, Sourhope

## Overview
- Topographic survey of the Rigg Foot plot, Sourhope.
- Conducted by Mick Whelan and Stuart Bradley, Department of Environmental Science, University of Stirling.
- Dates: April 4–6, 2000 and May 11–12, 2000.

## Data collection and tools
- Instrument: Leica Geosystems Total Station EDM.
- Data processing: interpolation and contouring with Liscad Plus Surveying and Engineering Environment v4.0.

## Data structure and markers
- Key elements:
  - Treatment boundary (+)
  - Sub-plot marker pegs (- ); some peg locations may be missing if not easily located
  - Survey points indicated by smaller dots (to be removed from definitive versions)
- A grid overlay with 0.5 m cells is included to approximate sample point locations.

## Data quality and provisional nature
- Smaller dots represent survey points that will be removed in definitive versions.
- Peg locations may be missing where pegs were difficult to locate.
- Grid overlay provides provisional approximations of sample-point locations.

## Data usage and archiving
- Data intended for standardised environmental monitoring outputs (maps, contours) and for integration with broader monitoring datasets.
- Implicit workflow supports verification, quality assurance, and eventual storage/archiving of the dataset.
