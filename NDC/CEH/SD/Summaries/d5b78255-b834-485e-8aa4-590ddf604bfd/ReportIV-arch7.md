NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme – Sourhope Site Summary

- Purpose and scope
  - Four years of intensive botanical monitoring at Sourhope (Macaulay Institute farm, Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Focus on above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and diversity; links to below-ground processes and soil properties are explored.
  - Data used to assess how management practices alter plant communities and their functions.

- Study site and experimental design
  - Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; five replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
  - Main plots per block: 6, with random treatment allocation; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells used for diagnostics.
  - Treatments (plot-level, with site-wide mowing): 
    - Control 1: no plot treatment
    - Control 2: no plot treatment
    - Nitrogen (N): NH4NO3 fertilizer
    - Lime (L): CaCO3
    - Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
    - Insecticide (formerly Biocide): Dursban 4 OPA (chlorpyrifos)
  - Mowing regime: monthly May–September, to c. 6 cm sward height (1999–2002 consistent).
  - Data collection since 1998–1999; includes automatic weather data, biomass sampling, point quadrat surveys, soil pH, and soil moisture.

- Data collection and methods
  - Above-ground biomass: monthly harvests (May–Sept) per plot sub-plot; samples dried and weighed.
  - Weather data: on-site Automatic Weather Station (rainfall, radiation, temperature).
  - Vegetation surveys: 0.5 m2 point analysis (quadrats) in July–August at multiple years (1998 baseline, 2000–2002 surveys); bryophyte identification improved in 2002.
  - Soil measurements: pH (approx. 5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe) in 2002.
  - Biodiversity metrics: Shannon diversity index calculated from point analyses; Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on species hits by treatment; functional-group classification (CSR framework) into stress tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR).
  - Additional small-scale surveys: litter hits, mosses, biomass per plot, and species lists (Appendices include detailed species lists and survey methods).

- Key results and interpretations
  - Mowing effect
    - Dominant shift from Agrostis spp. to Festuca rubra in fertilised plots; mosses (bryophytes) expanded across the site, aided by a roughly 6 cm sward and loss of grazing.
    - In unimproved plots, stress-tolerant species expanded; disturbance reduction (grazing exclusion) contributes to changes in community structure.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Nitrogen and/or lime increases in above-ground biomass; plots with both N and lime show the strongest productivity, though signs indicate possible peak in these plots by 2002.
    - Lime raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in the upper soil profile; higher pH interacts with moisture to influence productivity.
    - Positive relationship between soil pH and productivity generally, but the relationship varies by treatment; nitrogen-only and lime-only plots show different pH–productivity dynamics than combined N&L plots.
  - Insecticide effect
    - In 2002,  bryophyte abundance increased more in unimproved plots; higher plant diversity (Shannon index) observed in some insecticide-treated plots, though causal links to herbivory levels are not definitively established.
    - If insect herbivory is reduced, certain palatable species may gain, contributing to higher diversity in some contexts.
  - Trampling effect
    - In C2 plots (introduced for 2002 surveys), productivity decline likely linked to trampling during 13CO2 pulse experiments rather than a treatment strength.
  - Biodiversity and functional groups
    - Shannon diversity: 2002 shows declines in N&L plots relative to baseline; other treatments show mixed gains.
    - Point Analysis: stronger representation of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in improved plots; unimproved plots show higher bryophyte and certain dicot trends.
    - Functional groups: SR/CSR and CSR dynamics shift with treatments; C-S-R species dominate in nitrogen and lime plots; stress-tolerators gain in unimproved plots; SR/C-S-R reductions noted in lime and insecticide plots.
    - By 2002, significant treatment effects on functional group composition (S, CSR, SR/CSR) across plots, indicating management alters ecological strategies of the plant community.
  - Spatial and temporal patterns
    - Biomass productivity generally increased from 1999 baseline across treatments, but total 2002 biomass declined relative to 2001 (13.7% in N&L to 31.2% in Control 2).
    - Slope effect: lower productivity in higher blocks (Block 5) compared with lower blocks (Block 1) in 2002, indicating microtopography influences productivity.
    - PCA of point-analysis data separates improved vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots show distinct grouping; some nitrogen-treated plots cluster with limed plots, while others align with controls or insecticide plots.
  - Bryophytes and litter
    - Bryophyte hits rise across treatments (notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) and contribute to overall biomass in unimproved plots.
    - Litter hits show significant treatment differences from 2001 onward, with higher litter in certain treatments.

- Data implications for GIS and data products
  - Spatial mapping opportunities
    - Map of above-ground biomass by plot across years (1999–2002) with treatment overlays and slope position.
    - Soil properties layer: pH (5 cm) by plot and by year; soil moisture by cell for 2002 point surveys.
    - Species distribution maps by treatment and year (dominant taxa: Agrostis, Festuca spp., bryophytes; bryophyte distributions by treatment).
    - Functional-group distribution maps (S, CSR, SR/CSR proportions) by plot and year.
    - Litter and bryophyte cover maps to visualize non-vascular/vascular shifts.
  - Temporal data products
    - Time-series of biomass productivity by treatment and block.
    - Time-series of Shannon diversity by treatment and year.
    - Trend analyses of pH–productivity relationships across treatments.
  - Analytical layers
    - PCA loadings by year to illustrate species groupings and treatment separation.
    - Interaction effects (Treatment x Year) on biomass and diversity to identify non-linear responses.
  - Practical notes
    - Data are organized by blocks, plots, sub-plots, and 0.5 m2 cells; consider rasterization to common grid for GIS use.
    - 2002 data include some missing/interpolated weather data due to on-site station issues; document data gaps in mapped products.

- References and supplementary materials
  - Appendices provide detailed species lists (vascular and bryophyte), biomass per plot, rank analyses, and site activity logs.
  - Key methods and statistical results (ANOVA) support interpretation of treatment effects and interactions.

- Summary takeaway for GIS-focused data products
  - The Sourhope site demonstrates clear spatial and temporal responses of plant communities to mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide treatments.
  - Map-ready products should emphasize biomass productivity, species composition shifts (vascular and bryophyte), soil pH/moisture gradients, and the distribution of functional groups across treatments and years.
  - Understanding slope position and treatment interactions will improve interpretation of spatial patterns in map visualisations and support policy or stakeholder communications.
