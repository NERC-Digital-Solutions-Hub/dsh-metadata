# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for groups conducting more detailed studies, enabling year-to-year comparisons.
  - Monitoring covered weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition using standardized protocols; data intended for integration and cross-study comparisons.

- Monitoring approach and data management
  - Data collection included:
    - Automatic Weather Station measurements (headlines for 2001: rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar; slightly lower temperatures; higher soil moisture).
    - Above-ground biomass through seasonal mowing and Sampling across plot sub-plots with normalization to a reference plot (C1).
    - Soil pH from top 5 cm, tracking lime and nitrogen effects.
    - Botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys and species presence/abundance analyses; separate surveyors used with validated consistency.
  - Data handling:
    - Weather data regularly downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
    - A standardized schedule of measurements and sampling events was maintained (1998–2001 data collection; includes mowing, biomass harvesting, botanical surveys, minirhizotron analyses, and disturbance/nutrient surveys).
  - 2001 site management context:
    - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited site access from February to May 2001; activities were prorated under an agreed timetable.
    - Change of site Officer in Charge occurred in May 2001.

- 2. RESULTS

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 headline data generally unremarkable.
    - Rainfall near long-term average; total annual radiation similar to prior years.
    - Average temperatures slightly reduced; average soil moisture content higher than in earlier years.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments each year; peak biomass typically in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass estimates were substantially higher than previous years, likely due to a change in personnel and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - After normalising against C1, nitrogen and/or lime additions continued to show stronger positive effects on productivity.
    - Split-plot ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots and a significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant differences between blocks.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime addition raised topsoil pH (0–5 cm) to about:
      - 6.19 in limed plots
      - 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime (N&L) plots
    - Nitrogen addition alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Quadrat survey consistent with 2000 methods; surveyor differences statistically insignificant.
    - 2001 total hits were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting greater sward density (potentially from reduced grazing since 1998).
    - Treatment differences in dominant species:
      - Agrostis capillaris decreased across all treatments in 2001 (except remaining most abundant in Control and Limed plots).
      - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (Festuca rubra) plots.
      - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more apparent in fertilised plots, especially N+L.
      - Species associated with less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
    - Species richness: unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) had 24 species; Nitrogen&Lime plots had 18 species, suggesting potential declines in diversity with greater fertility.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots associated with bryophytes and Nardus stricta; improved plots characterized by Festuca rubra and related species.
    - Biomass correlations:
      - Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively correlated with biomass.
      - Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass increased.
      - Litter frequency increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

- 3. SITE HETEROGENEITY

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site (e.g., columns E and F on the right-facing slope showed more acidic plots, partly explained by treatment mix but indicative of underlying spatial variation).
    - Nitrogen and/or Lime improved plots tended to have comparatively lower pH in specific columns, consistent with localized heterogeneity.

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - 2001 biomass values showed outliers with notably low biomass on several plots, while central site plots often had higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
    - There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass overall.
    - No significant difference in biomass between blocks, indicating local heterogeneity rather than block-level effects driving patterns.

- Endnotes
  - The report emphasizes linking large-scale monitoring data (weather, soil chemistry, biomass, plant community) to inter-year comparisons and cross-study analyses.
  - It highlights the impact of management changes, site access restrictions, and spatial heterogeneity on data interpretation and the importance of accounting for these factors in monitoring analyses.
