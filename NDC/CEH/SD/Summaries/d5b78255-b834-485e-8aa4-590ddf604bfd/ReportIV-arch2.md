# SUMMARY

- The document reports four years of monitoring from the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope field site, focusing on above-ground productivity (biomass), plant species composition, and diversity under five prescribed treatments across fertilised and unfertilised plots, plus a mowing regime and an insecticide treatment.
- Primary aim for analysts is to track environmental condition and policy-relevant outputs over time using standardized data streams (biomass, diversity indices, soil chemistry, moisture) and to relate them to management practices.

## Site, design, and management
- Location: Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders; 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; plots subdivided for multiple research groups.
- Treatments (dominant themes):
  - Fertilised vs unfertilised: Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) on designated plots
  - Controls: Control 1 and Control 2 (Control 2 later excluded from some analyses)
- Management actions each year: mowing across the site (~6 cm height) from May–Sept; insecticide applied after mowing on insecticide plots; lime and nitrogen added in spring as specified.
- Data collection: on-site weather station; above-ground biomass sampling from 0.5 m2 cells; baseline vegetation survey in 1998; annual point quadrat analyses (2000–2002); soil pH (5 cm depth) and moisture measurements; periodic small-scale botanical and biomass surveys; extensive appendices documenting species lists and plots.

## Key data and methods tailored for monitoring
- Measurements include:
  - Above-ground biomass (annual, from multiple mowing events)
  - Species composition and abundance via point analyses (0.5 m2 cells; 25–100 point grids)
  - Bryophyte and liverwort identification in 2002 survey
  - Soil pH and moisture (theta probe)
  - Weather data (rainfall, temperature, radiation)
- Analyses used: split-plot ANOVA (Treatment, Year, and interactions); PCA on point analysis data; Shannon Diversity Indices; examination of functional plant groups (CSR framework).

## Major findings and interpretation
- Mowing effect
  - Dominant shift: Festuca spp. increase; Agrostis spp. decline (Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis drop by >40% since 2000).
  - Bryophyte expansion (mosses) across the site, aided by ~6 cm sward height and lack of grazing; bryophyte hits rise from ~6.5% (2000) to ~19.9% (2002).
  - Suggests disturbance regime change (loss of grazing) and mowing height influence species structure and bryophyte proliferation; vasc. productivity dampens this effect in fertile plots.
- Fertilisation effect
  - Persistent productivity boost in fertilised plots, especially where nitrogen and lime are both applied (N&L). Productivity in these plots remains the most productive, though signs of possible peak or stress at high pH and lower soil moisture are noted.
  - Lime markedly raises soil pH toward ~7.0 in upper soil; nitrogen also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Higher pH and reduced soil moisture in fertilised plots may increase vulnerability to drought stress; chlorosis observed in lime-treated plots.
  - Functional shift: C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species expand in N&L plots; SR/C-S-R species decline in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
- Insecticide effect
  - Insecticide plots show highest diversity in Shannon Index trends among some years, though direct causal links to diversity are inconclusive without mechanistic data on herbivory; possible indirect benefit to palatable, competitive species when herbivory pressure is reduced.
  - Bryophyte and vascular plant responses indicate complex plant-herbivore interactions; overall, diversity patterns suggest insecticide may contribute to altered competitive dynamics.
- Trampling effect
  - First-time sampling in C2 plots in 2002 likely contributed to observed productivity drops in those plots, attributed to trampling during 13CO2 pulse activities; indicates trampling and experimental pulses can suppress growth locally.
- Biodiversity and community structure
  - Point analyses reveal clear treatment-driven shifts in functional groups:
    - Improved (fertilised) plots enriched in grasses typical of fertilised pastures (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and dominance by C-S-R types.
    - Unimproved plots show greater bryophyte abundance and stress-tolerant species, with lower overall abundance of typical grasses.
  - PCA of 2002 point data separates lime-treated plots from others; some nitrogen-treated samples cluster with limed plots, indicating fertilisation can mimic lime effects in vegetation structure.
  - Shannon Diversity Index: 2002 shows declines in nitrogen-and-lime plots relative to baseline, while other treatments show increases; diversity trends are significant across years (2000–2002).
  - Bryophytes show increasing relative abundance on unimproved plots; moss contribution to biomass rises markedly in 2002.
- Functional groups (CSR framework)
  - Stress-tolerators (S) expand in unimproved plots; competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and SR/CSR groups dominate in fertilised plots.
  - By 2002, significant treatment differences emerge across CSR-related categories, reflecting environment-driven trait deployment (pH, nutrients, disturbance).

## Data use implications for monitoring and policy
- Value augmentation: The dataset demonstrates how environmental monitoring can be enhanced by combining site-level responses (biomass, diversity) with soil chemistry and moisture data, enabling cross-linkages between above- and below-ground processes.
- Data access: The study highlights the importance of storing and providing access to underlying datasets via portals, to allow broader use and secondary analyses by other groups.

## Conclusions for environmental monitoring
- Disturbance regime (loss of grazing) and mowing height interact with fertilisation to shape productivity, species composition, and functional group structure.
- Fertilisation markedly boosts productivity but may drive functional shifts toward competitive species; pH increases from lime application can influence plant responses and moisture interactions.
- Herbivore interactions (insecticide effects) may indirectly influence diversity, but causal links require more targeted data.
- Trampling and experimental pulses can confound interpretation of productivity metrics in targeted plots.
- For long-term environmental monitoring, standardized data streams (biomass, diversity, soil chemistry, moisture, weather) combined with robust metadata and accessibility will support scrutinizing environmental health and policy performance over time.
