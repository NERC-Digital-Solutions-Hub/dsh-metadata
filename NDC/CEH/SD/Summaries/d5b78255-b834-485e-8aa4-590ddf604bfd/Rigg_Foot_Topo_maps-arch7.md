# Topographic survey conducted at the Rigg Foot plot, Sourhope

## Overview
- Topographic survey of the Rigg Foot plot, Sourhope.
- Conducted by Mick Whelan and Stuart Bradley (Department of Environmental Science, University of Stirling).
- Dates of fieldwork: April 4–6, 2000 and May 11–12, 2000.

## Methods and Equipment
- Instrumentation: Leica Geosystems Total Station EDM.
- Data processing: interpolation and contouring performed using LISCAD Plus Surveying and Engineering Environment v4.0.

## Data Elements and Legend
- Key symbols:
  - + Treatment boundary
  - -  Sub-plot marker peg (some peg locations may be missing if peg was difficult to locate)
  - - Smaller dots indicate individual survey points and will be removed from definitive versions
- Grid overlay: a 0.5 m cell grid superimposed to allow approximate location of sample points.
- Dataset includes a sequence of identifiers (01–40) with some numbers possibly omitted.

## Processing and Grid
- Contour interpolation created from survey points using Liscad Plus v4.0.
- 0.5 m grid included to assist approximate positioning of sample points within the surveyed area.

## Notes and Limitations
- Some sub-plot marker pegs may be missing due to locating difficulties.
- Smaller dots correspond to survey points that are intended to be removed in definitive versions.
- The 0.5 m grid provides approximate locations; precise coordinates may differ in the final dataset.

## GIS Considerations
- Useful as a baseline topographic layer with boundaries, marker positions, and contour information.
- Suitable for map-based visualizations and spatial analyses once finalized and cleaned.
