# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and purpose
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme studying a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Aimed to provide a broad context and context-rich data for groups’ more detailed studies; baseline data from 1998 used for comparisons across years.
  - 2001 events affected management: foot-and-mouth restrictions limited site access (Feb–May 2001); subsequent protocol changes and a change in site officer.

- Data collected and experimental design
  - Automatic Weather Station data (1999–2001): rainfall, radiation, average temperatures, soil moisture; site trends compared year-to-year.
  - Above-ground biomass: five mowing periods per summer (May–Sept); 0.5 m2 plots within each plot; biomass dried and weighed; data normalized to a reference plot (C1) for cross-year comparisons.
  - Soil pH: top 5 cm sampled; effects of lime and nitrogen on pH tracked (limed and N&L plots show the strongest pH increases).
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys in July 2001 (and 2000 for comparison); 100 cells per frame, 25 pins per cell; species hits recorded; data analyzed with PCA and ANOVA; survey consistency checked between two surveyors.
  - Treatments and measures: Control (two plots), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen + Lime, Biocide; data include biomass, pH, and species composition.
  - Data processing and governance: Use of Genstat 5 for ANOVA and PCA; documentation of measurement dates and protocol changes; routine data transmission to data managers; site management and sampling schedules outlined (Table 1).

- Key results
  - Weather and site conditions (2001)
    - Rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to prior years; slight cooling and higher soil moisture compared with earlier years.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Clear hierarchy of treatment effects: nitrogen and/or lime increase biomass; greatest biomass in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to both personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - ANOVA indicates significant treatment effects, especially between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; year-to-year interaction present.
  - Soil pH
    - Lime raises pH substantially; October 2001 averages: limed plots ~6.19; N&L plots ~6.38; nitrogen alone raises pH modestly; controls remain near baseline.
  - Botanical composition
    - 2001: Agrostis capillaris declines across most treatments; Festuca spp. increases, especially in fertilized plots.
    - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) show more species typical of improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis); unimproved plots retain species associated with poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
    - Diversity appears to decline in the most improved plots (24 species in unimproved vs 18 in improved plots).
    - PCA separates nitrogen- and lime-treated plots from controls and biocide plots; biomass positively correlates with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance, while certain other species decline as biomass increases.
    - Increased litter in plots with nitrogen and/or lime indicates faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
  - Site heterogeneity
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns on the right side of the site show more acidic conditions and different species patterns, influenced by plot composition (-controls and biocide-heavy columns).
    - Biomass patterns show central plots often have higher biomass; positive correlation found between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant differences across blocks.

- Data considerations and implications for data leadership
  - Consistency and comparability
    - Inter-surveyor consistency generally good; minor differences mitigated by cross-checks.
    Biomass and species data show meaningful year-to-year and treatment-driven shifts when normalized to C1.
  - Data gaps and challenges
    - 2001 FMD period reduced access and required protocol adaptations; missing one biocide application.
    - Change of site officer during the period; potential impacts on data collection cadence and protocol adherence.
  - Data management recommendations for data leaders
    - Maintain metadata on site heterogeneity, treatment definitions, plot locations, and year-specific protocol changes.
    - Use normalization anchors (e.g., C1) to compare across years and reduce site-specific biases.
    - Employ multivariate approaches (e.g., PCA) alongside traditional ANOVA to capture treatment, year, and spatial effects on community composition.
    - Document data collection schedules, measurement dates, and any deviations (e.g., equipment changes, mowing methods) to support cross-study integration.
    - Ensure data discovery and discoverability by linking biomass, pH, weather, and botanical datasets with clear identifiers for plots, treatments, and years.
