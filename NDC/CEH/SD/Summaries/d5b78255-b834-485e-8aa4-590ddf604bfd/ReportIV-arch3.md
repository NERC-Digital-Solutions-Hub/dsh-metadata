# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, Sourhope Site

## Overview
- Four-year summary of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders).
- Aim: understand soil biota alongside above-ground plant responses and monitor productivity, species composition, and diversity under controlled management treatments.
- Site design: Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients; 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated at random; 0.5 m2 sampling cells used for data collection.
- Projects: 24 Phase I projects and 8 Phase II projects; many Phase II activities in 2002, including labelled 13CO2 pulses and gas measurements.

## Treatments and management
- Site-level: monthly mowing of all vegetation to ~6 cm (May–Sept).
- Plot-level treatments (randomised across plots): Control 1, Control 2 (unfertilised controls), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide (Dursban 4).
- Management inputs:
  - Nitrogen and/or lime applied in spring (varies by year).
  - Insecticide applied after mowing when weather permitted.
- Data collection cadence: ongoing since 1999 for biomass; baseline botanical survey in 1998; annual/seasonal surveys (point analysis) in 2000–2002; soil pH measured since 1998; soil moisture measured in 2002.

## Data collection and measures
- Weather and environment: on-site Automatic Weather Station providing rainfall, radiation, temperature, and moisture data (1999–2002; data gaps noted in 2002).
- Above-ground productivity: yearly biomass estimates from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots; samples dried and weighed.
- Botanical surveys:
  - Baseline 0.5 m2 point quadrat (July–August 1998).
  - Repeated 0.5 m2 point analysis surveys in 2000, 2001, 2002 using 100-hole frame; identification extended to bryophytes in 2002.
  - Additional small-scale surveys and biomass sorting by species (2000–2002).
- Soil measurements: soil pH (5 cm depth) regularly; theta probe for soil moisture in 2002; additional soil sampling since 1998 (total soil samples >11,000 across the project).
- Data analysis: split-plot ANOVA (biomass by treatment and year), PCA of point-analysis species data, calculation of Shannon diversity indices, and functional-group (CSR) classification (stress-tolerators, competitiveness, ruderal).

## Key findings: productivity and treatment effects
- Fertilisation effect:
  - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently boost above-ground biomass; highest productivity in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.
  - Productivity in these fertilised plots may have peaked by 2002, possibly linked to near-neutral pH (~7.0) and reduced soil moisture.
  - Fertilised plots show signs of plant stress (chlorosis) under high lime and nitrogen regimes in 2002.
  - Soil pH rises with lime, nitrogen adds a smaller positive effect; higher pH correlates with lower soil moisture and potentially lower productivity in some plots.
- Mowing effect:
  - Regular mowing coincides with declines in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across most treatments, suggesting a site-level response to mowing rather than to a specific treatment.
  - Festuca rubra expands, particularly in fertilised plots; bryophytes expand across the site, possibly due to maintained sward height (~6 cm) and reduced grazing disturbance.
  - Stress-tolerant species increase across treatments (except where nitrogen and lime are applied together), indicating a shift toward lower disturbance and/or altered resource availability.
- Insecticide effect:
  - Dursban application may influence plant diversity by reducing herbivory, potentially favoring more palatable species; evidence aligns with broader literature, but direct causation is not definitively established from this dataset.
- Trampling effect:
  - 2002 data from C2 plots show notable productivity reductions attributed to trampling during intensive 13CO2 pulse experiments, suggesting disturbance-related suppression of growth in these plots.
- Slope and spatial effects:
  - Productivity declines along the slope from bottom to top (Block 1 to Block 5) in 2002; slope position influences biomass outcomes.

## Functional groups and community composition (CSR framework)
- Dominant functional groups across plots: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and SR/CSR combinations.
- 2000–2002 trends:
  - Nitrogen and lime fertilisation (particularly N&L) promote C-S-R and SR/C-S-R communities, favoring faster-growing, more competitive species under improved growing conditions.
  - Unfertilised plots favour stress-tolerant species; the disturbance-reduction effect (loss of grazing) may promote S-dominance.
  - Lime and nitrogen interactions reduce the presence of SR/CSR species, with CS-R species thriving where lime-induced higher pH dominates.
- Point-analysis results (2002):
  - Improved plots (N, Lime, N&L) show higher abundance of grasses such as Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra; unimproved plots retain dominance of Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp.
  - Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) increase across treatments, most pronounced in unimproved plots; bryophyte presence is negatively associated with high N and/or lime in some species.
  - Functional-group composition differences between treatments become highly significant by 2002.

## Biodiversity and community composition metrics
- Shannon diversity:
  - No significant differences at baseline (1998); significant treatment differences emerge in 2000 and become stronger in 2001 and 2002.
  - By 2002, Shannon diversity declines in the N&L plots compared with other treatments (approximately 15% drop versus increases of 2–29% in other treatments).
- Species composition (point analysis):
  - PCA separates improved (fertilised) plots from unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots forming a distinct cluster.
  - The relative abundance of key grasses shifts with treatments; Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis become more dominant in fertilised plots, while Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp. predominate in unimproved plots.
- Bryophytes:
  - Bryophyte hits rise from 6.5% (2000) to nearly 20% (2002) of total hits; most pronounced in unimproved plots, coinciding with reduced vascular plant dominance and increased moss diversity.
- Litter and dead vegetation:
  - 2001–2002 show significant differences among treatments, with fertilised plots often exhibiting higher litter interactions; remains lowest in some control plots.

## Data quality, analysis, and governance notes
- Data volume and scope:
  - Over 11,600 soil samples collected since the project start; extensive biomass and botanical data, including 1998 baseline and 2000–2002 follow-ups.
- Data integrity and gaps:
  - 2002 weather data includes missing periods due to station malfunctions; substitutions made from nearby stations for several periods.
- Analyses:
  - Use of log transformations for biomass; mixed-model split-plot ANOVA; PCA and diversity indices to explore treatment effects on community structure.
- Metadata and reporting:
  - Appendix materials (species lists, treatment summaries, weather data, biomass records, and PCA plots) accompany the main text, illustrating a structured, multi-dimensional data approach suitable for monitoring frameworks.
- Data sharing and governance considerations:
  - The project generates a broad set of datasets (species lists, biomass, soil chemistry, weather, and survey results) that could be shared with stakeholders; notable challenges include standardizing metadata, ensuring consistent naming (e.g., Control 1 vs Control 2), and maintaining data provenance across years and appendices.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks (relevance to authors of monitoring frameworks)
- Multi-metric, multi-year design:
  - Combines productivity, species composition, and functional-group analyses to capture both above- and below-ground responses to management.
- Standardized, repeatable measures:
  - Repeated biomass harvesting, point analyses, soil pH, and moisture measurements provide a robust, repeatable framework for detecting treatment effects over time.
- Functional-type focus:
  - CSR-based classification adds interpretive power for understanding how communities respond to nutrient status and disturbance regimes.
- Data management considerations:
  - Emphasizes the importance of baseline data, consistent treatment regimes, and transparent data handling (e.g., weather data gaps; documentation in appendices) to support long-term monitoring.
- Communication of complex results:
  - Use of figures (biomass trends, pH vs biomass, PCA plots) and appendix tables supports clear presentation of nuanced, multi-dimensional findings for policy and decision-making.
- Barriers and opportunities:
  - The study illustrates challenges common to monitoring frameworks: data gaps, meta-data quality, cross-year comparability, and the need to publicly share datasets while managing data governance.
