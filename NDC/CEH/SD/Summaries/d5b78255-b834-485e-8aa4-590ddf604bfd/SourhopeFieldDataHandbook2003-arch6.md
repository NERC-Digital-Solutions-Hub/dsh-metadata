# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

- Detailed soil profiles and associated vegetation data for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 profiles, with additional ECOTRON plots.
- Includes horizon descriptions, laboratory soil analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys by plot, plus data management and accessibility notes.

## 1) Site context and profile structure

- BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 provide multi-horizon soil profiles with detailed descriptions, boundary types, root characteristics, and gravel/stone content.
- Common features across blocks:
  - Predominantly organic-rich, acidic surfaces with high loss on ignition (LOI) and substantial fibrous rooting.
  - Progressive weathering with horizons ranging from light fibrous LF/FH to organic-rich Ah and mineral horizons (AB, Bg/BCg, Cg).
  - Presence of igneous stones (andesite) and varying stone abundance by horizon and block.
- Block 4 horizons (example sequence): LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm) with Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
- Block 5 horizons (example sequence): LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).

## 2) BLOCK 4 – soil profile and chemistry highlights

- General soil characteristics:
  - Surface horizons: acidic, humic, high LOI; abundant fine roots.
  - Ah horizon: dark colored, sandy-silt loam with many roots; notable presence of igneous stones.
  - Bsg and Cx horizons show mixed mineral content with variable Ca, Mg, K, and trace elements.
- Selected chemical patterns (horizons FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bs, Cx):
  - %N ranges broadly within horizons, with FH higher than deeper horizons.
  - %C and C:N ratios indicate substantial organic matter in surface horizons, decreasing with depth.
  - Exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K) show considerable variation by horizon; Ca often high in upper/mineral transitions, with Mg and K variable.
  - pH(H2O) generally in the acidic range (roughly 4.0–5.0) across horizons; CaCl2 pH also acidic.
  - %Moisture loss and LOI are highest in surface horizons, decreasing with depth.
- Vegetation context (BLOCK 4):
  - Dominant grassland communities aligned with high-surface organic content; edge vs interior plot patterns noted.
  - Indicator species and subcommunities identified through analyses, with variations linked to slope position and moisture.

## 3) BLOCK 5 – soil profile and chemistry highlights

- General soil characteristics:
  - Clear horizon sequence with well-developed Ah and AB horizons transitioning to Bg, BCg, and Cg horizons.
  - Deepening profiles show increasing clay content and mottling in Bg/BCg horizons, with a strong organic-rich Ah at shallow depths.
- Selected chemical patterns (horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg):
  - %N typically higher in surface horizons (Ah) and decreases with depth.
  - %C is highest in surface horizons (Ah) and remains substantial in AB/Bg horizons, then declines in Cg.
  - C:N ratios trend from around 10–16 in upper horizons to higher values deeper, reflecting organic signatures.
  - Ca often elevated in upper to mid horizons (up to ~11 meq/100 g in some horizons), with Na, K, and Mg showing horizon-dependent variation.
  - %Moisture loss and LOI are highest in surface horizons, declining with depth; pH values indicate acidity (approx. pH H2O 4.3–5.0; pH CaCl2 ~3.5–4.0 in many horizons).
- Auger samples (AUGER 5A–5F) show consistent trends with surface horizons richer in organic content and lower pH, and deeper horizons with more mineral character and variable exchangeable cations.
- Vegetation context (BLOCK 5):
  - Detailed plot-level species totals indicate community structure associated with slope position and microhabitat variation.
  - Data reflect shifts in species composition across plots along the block sequence.

## 4) AUGER SAMPLES and ECOTRON SITE data

- AUGER SAMPLES (BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5):
  - Parameters measured include wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Observed ranges:
    - %N ~0.5–2.2; %C ~6–38% (surface horizons higher); C:N ~10–16 in many horizons.
    - Ca generally higher in surface horizons with substantial variation among samples; Mg and K also variable.
    - %Moisture loss and LOI highest in surface horizons; pH values in acidic range.
- ECOTRON PLOT data:
  - Soil: wt ~6.1 mg; %N ~0.59; %C ~8.22; C:N ~13.83; Ca ~2.76; Mg ~1.7; pH H2O ~4.79; pH CaCl2 ~3.82.
  - Vegetation: multiple subplots with species totals and presence/absence patterns recorded, enabling cross-plot comparisons with soil chemistry.

## 5) Vegetation surveys and community context

- BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 vegetation surveys accompany soil profiles, detailing species totals per plot and subplots.
- Key community signatures:
  - Core Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile type grassland (NVC U4d) with subcommunities.
  - In moister zones, Nardus stricta-Galium saxatile (NVC U5b) is more prevalent.
- Pattern observations:
  - Species richness often linked to slope position (downslope increases) and microhabitat (edge vs interior plots).
  - Indicator and co-occurring species identified; plots show spatially variable community structure.

## 6) Data quality, limitations, and accessibility

- Limitations:
  - Partial sampling within plots (e.g., 25 subplots per main plot for year-one data) means results are indicative rather than exhaustive.
  - Some horizon and block measurements show anomalies requiring careful interpretation.
  - Longitudinal data beyond the initial baseline year (1998) are referenced but not exhaustively enumerated in this excerpt.
- Data handling and storage:
  - Samples archived (e.g., -80°C storage) with horizon-level and block-level data organized in blocks, horizons, and measurement types.
  - Analyses available in appendices and separate documents (e.g., Twinspan.doc, Association.xls).
- Availability:
  - Data and raw datasets referenced as accessible via appendices and public-facing materials; archived in Sourhope field data handbook repositories (Appendix A, per-block datasets).

## 7) Data availability and storage

- Data organized by block, horizon, and measurement type; per-block soil and vegetation metrics documented in Appendices.
- Soil samples stored at CEH Merlewood; field data housed within the Sourhope field data handbook and associated analyses (Twinspan, NVC, Association analyses).
- Barcode-based tracking (MLURI Barcodes) for samples and analyses.

- ECOTRON and field plots provide integrated data for cross-site comparisons, enabling long-term data use and cross-project analyses.
