# Topographic survey conducted at the Rigg Foot plot, Sourhope

## Overview
- Survey of the Rigg Foot plot in Sourhope conducted by Mick Whelan and Stuart Bradley (Department of Environmental Science, University of Stirling)
- Field dates: April 4–6, 2000 and May 11–12, 2000
- Purpose: capture topography for the plot with precise location data and planning references

## Methods and tools
- Instrumentation: Leica Geosystems Total Station EDM
- Data processing: interpolation and contouring performed using Liscad Plus Surveying and Engineering Environment v4.0 software

## Data elements and markers
- Treatment boundary indicated with +
- Sub-plot markers indicated with a symbol (); some peg locations may be missing if peg was not easy to locate
- Smaller dots represent individual survey points; these will be removed from definitive versions
- Grid overlay implemented to aid location of sample points; grid cells are 0.5 m

## Grid and sample points
- Sample points are labeled 01 through 40; note that some numbers (e.g., 31) may be omitted in the provided excerpt
- The 0.5 m grid allows approximate localization of sample points within the survey area

## Data quality and caveats
- Some peg locations were difficult to locate, leading to potential missing markers
- Provisional survey points (smaller dots) are not included in definitive datasets
- The grid is for approximate positioning; final analyses should rely on validated, definitive survey points once established

## Context for use
- Provides baseline topographic data for the Rigg Foot plot, enabling subsequent environmental analyses, comparisons, or modeling with spatially explicit elevation and boundary information
