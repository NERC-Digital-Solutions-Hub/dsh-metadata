# RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Reports on an intensive field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aims to provide a broad context for researchers, enabling cross-study comparisons and linking with other data.
- Baseline established in 1998; monitoring included to contextualize detailed studies.
- 2001 management impacted by Foot and Mouth restrictions and a change of site officer.

## Data Collected and Measurements
- Management and measurements coordinated across a site with plots arranged in blocks; data collected on multiple axes to aid cross-study comparisons.
- Measurements and data types include:
  - Automatic Weather Station data (2001 briefing headline weather measures; linked to CEH data manager).
  - Above-ground biomass (biomass harvests across five mowing occasions in summer; 1999–2001).
  - Soil pH (upper 5 cm, October 2001; lime and nitrogen effects).
  - Botanical composition (Point Quadrat surveys in July 2001; species hits and relative abundances).
  - Additional vegetation surveys around minirhizotron tubes and disturbance/nutrient plots.
- Data management and sharing: data transmitted to CEH Merlewood; emphasis on enabling comparisons and re-use.

## Experimental Context and Management Impacts
- Site management influenced by two 2001 events:
  - FMD restrictions halted visitors Feb–May 2001; sampling proceeded under protocol and veterinary oversight thereafter.
  - Change of officer in charge after May 2001.
- 2001 activities included a shift from manual mowing to mechanical shears, affecting biomass measurements.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather was broadly unremarkable relative to long-term trends.
- Rainfall near the long-term average; radiation similar; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than in prior years.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Consistent treatment hierarchy in biomass across the sampling period.
- Peak biomass consistently in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass estimates increased substantially compared with previous years, likely due to personnel change and switch to mechanical mowing.
- Biomass analyses (log-transformed) showed:
  - Significant differences between improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) vs non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.
- Treatment effects:
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime (especially Nitrogen + Lime) most effective at promoting biomass.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition raised soil pH over time:
  - Limed plots: average pH 6.19 (Oct 2001).
  - Nitrogen & Lime plots: average pH 6.38 (Oct 2001).
  - Nitrogen alone raised pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed little change since baseline (Aug 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat protocol consistent with July 2000.
- Survey consistency between surveyors verified (no significant difference in results between surveyors; p = 0.18 NS).
- Species density increased in 2001; total hits 58% higher than 2000 across all treatments.
- Clear treatment differences in dominant species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 (only remains most abundant in Control 1 and Limed plots).
  - Festuca spp. (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen and Biocide (F. ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (F. rubra) plots.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were most apparent in fertilised plots (especially N & L).
  - Less fertile pasture species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more apparent in unimproved controls.
- Diversity:
  - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting possible diversity decline with greater soil fertility.
- Multivariate analysis:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Improved plots linked with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots linked with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Biomass correlation with species:
  - Higher biomass positively correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Decline in relative abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with increasing biomass.
  - Observed increase in litter frequency in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity
- Spatial variation observed across the site:
  - Columns E and F showed more acidic plots, correlated with treatments (notably more Controls/Biocide in those columns).
  - Biomass distribution showed outlier plots with lower biomass spread across treatments, and higher biomass generally in more central plots (e.g., certain N+L, Lime, Biocide plots).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass across plots.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks (statistical test: ANOVA).

## Data Quality and Considerations for Data Use
- Data reliability supported by:
  - Consistency checks between surveyors; no significant inter-operator differences.
  - Acknowledgement of management changes and 2001 field conditions that may affect comparability (switch to mechanical mowing, FMD-related access restrictions).
- The dataset includes multiple years of repeated measures and a robust design (block and plot treatments) enabling cross-year and cross-treatment analyses.

## Data Products and Implications for Use
- Provides a comprehensive, multi-dimensional dataset suitable for:
  - Analyzing effects of lime and nitrogen on productivity and vegetation composition.
  - Evaluating biodiversity responses to fertilisation vs unimproved management.
  - Exploring spatial heterogeneity within a controlled field experiment and its impact on productivity and community composition.
  - Linking above-ground biomass to soil pH and plant community shifts via correlation and PCA analyses.
- Data-rich outputs include:
  - Time-series biomass data (1999–2001) with annual and per-mowing measurements.
  - Soil pH changes by treatment over time.
  - Species-level abundance data and diversity metrics from Point Quadrat surveys.
  - PCA and ANOVA results illustrating treatment effects and inter-annual dynamics.
