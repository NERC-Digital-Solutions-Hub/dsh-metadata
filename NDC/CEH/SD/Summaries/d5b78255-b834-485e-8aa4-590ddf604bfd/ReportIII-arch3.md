# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview and Aim
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; a large, intensive field experiment at Sourhope to provide a broad monitoring context for linked studies.
  - Aimed to enable cross-year comparisons and give researchers a general context to interpret their specific data.
  - Table 1 lists the types and dates of measurements to support contextual understanding and comparisons.

- Monitoring Framework and Data Collected
  - Monitoring focus areas:
    - Automatic Weather Station data (headline measures) for 1999–2001.
    - Above-ground biomass production across treatments (1999–2001).
    - Soil pH in the top 5 cm, with lime and nitrogen treatments tracked.
    - Botanical composition using Point Analysis surveys (July 2001; continued from 2000 protocol).
  - Data collection cadence and methods:
    - Mowing of vegetation on five occasions per summer; biomass from 0.5 m2 subplots; drying and weighing for annual totals.
    - Standardised Point Quadrat surveys with a 100-cell frame; recorder cross-checked for consistency.
    - Full or partial site activity logs (e.g., soil sampling counts, measurements) compiled annually.
    - Weather data regularly downloaded and transmitted to a central Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
  - Data management context:
    - Data were integrated to support cross-group analyses; findings presented in reports, figures, and tables to aid cross-study linkage.
    - The site management plan guided activities; data governance and openness were facilitated via centralized data handling (Data Manager).

- Key Findings by Measure
  - Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - Weather was generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to prior years; mild decrease in average temperature and higher soil moisture vs. previous year.
  - Above-ground biomass (1999–2001)
    - Consistent treatment hierarchy of biomass across years; peak biomass typically in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to personnel change and shift from manual mowing to mechanical shears.
    - Nitrogen and lime treatments most strongly promoted biomass; the combination of nitrogen plus lime produced the strongest effect.
    - Normalisation against a reference plot (C1) used to highlight treatment effects over time.
  - Soil pH (0–5 cm)
    - Lime additions raised pH to about 6.19 (limed plots) and 6.38 (N&L plots); nitrogen alone also increased pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots showed no significant change since baseline (1998).
  - Botanical composition (July 2001 Point Analysis)
    - 24 species observed in unimproved (Control/Biocide) plots vs. 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting diversity changes with fertility improvements.
    - Shifts in species dominance: Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments; Festuca spp. and Poa pratensis increased, particularly in fertilised plots.
    - Improved plots showed greater presence of species associated with improved pastures (F. rubra, P. pratensis) while unimproved plots retained species linked to less fertile conditions (A. odoratum, Nardus stricta).
    - Diversity appeared to decline slightly in the most improved plots (N&L) based on the number of species recorded.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; litter proliferation and higher turnover linked to fertility increases.
  - Biomass–species relationships
    - Biomass positively correlated with the relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
    - Higher biomass associated with reduced relative abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) and some other bryophytes.
    - Increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots corresponded with faster vegetation turnover.

- Site Heterogeneity and Spatial Patterns
  - Clear spatial variation across the site:
    - Columns E and F hypothesized to be more acidic; underlying heterogeneity observed with lower pH in some nitrogen/limed columns.
  - Biomass variation:
    - Outlying plots tended to have lower biomass across treatments, while higher biomass tended to occur in centrally located plots.
  - Relationship between soil pH and biomass:
    - Strong positive correlation observed between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences in biomass between blocks.

- Operational Context and Management Impacts
  - Field management disruptions:
    - 2001 FMD outbreak temporarily restricted site access; sample collection occurred under a protocol and during a restricted period.
    - Change of site officer in 2001; one biocide application in May 2001 was missed but others were completed.
  - Management activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, Point Analysis) largely continued in 2001 per the Site Management Plan.

- Data Quality, Accessibility and Governance Considerations
  - Data integrity and comparability:
    - Standardised protocols across years supported cross-year comparisons of biomass, pH, and botanical data.
    - Cross-checks for surveyors' consistency demonstrated no significant bias in 2001 data.
  - Metadata and transformation needs:
    - Biomass data were ln-transformed for ANOVA analyses to meet statistical assumptions.
  - Data governance and sharing:
    - Weather data were centralized via a Data Manager, illustrating centralized data governance and sharing within the project.
    - Broad dissemination of outputs through reports and figures supports transparency, though explicit discussion of data-sharing barriers in this document is minimal.
  - Documentation and reproducibility:
    - Detailed tables (e.g., Table 1 on data collection, Tables 3–6 on results, PCA figures) and explicit references to analysis methods (Genstat 5, ANOVA, PCA) support reproducibility.

- Endnotes and Context
  - Species codes and plots are explicitly documented to support interpretation and cross-referencing of results with other components of the Soil Biodiversity Programme.
  - The report emphasizes links between management practices (N, Lime, Biocide) and ecological responses (biomass, pH, species composition, turnover), illustrating how a monitoring framework can integrate management actions with ecological indicators for policy evaluation and decision-making.
