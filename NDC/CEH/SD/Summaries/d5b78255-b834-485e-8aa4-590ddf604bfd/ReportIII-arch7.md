# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, within the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Focus on monitoring and interpreting interactions between management treatments, soil chemistry, vegetation, and biomass over 1999–2001.
- Provides context for linking site data with broader datasets and for developing map-based data products.

## Site and Data Collection Context
- Location: Sourhope field site, 25 plots arranged in blocks with multiple treatment regimes.
- Treatments include: Control (two plots), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Biocide.
- Measurements collected (1999–2001): above-ground biomass, soil pH (0–5 cm depth), botanical composition (Point Quadrat survey), and site weather data via Automatic Weather Station.
- Methods close to those described in Baseline Data Survey (1998); includes mowing events, biomass harvesting, and detailed botanical surveys.
- 2001 context: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited site access Feb–May; a change of site leadership occurred in 2001.

## Key Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather metrics broadly near long-term averages after a very wet prior year.
- 2001 rainfall around 839 mm; total radiation ~3473 MJ/m2; average surface moisture high relative to earlier years.
- Temperature averages slightly cooler than previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass production; peak biomass typically in July–August each year.
- 2001 showed a substantial biomass increase relative to 2000, attributed to staff changes and the switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Biomass trends normalized against C1 (Control 1) to compare treatment effects.
- ANOVA results indicate significant differences between improved (N and/or L added) vs non-improved plots and a significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
- Nitrogen and Lime (especially Nitrogen + Lime) most effectively promoted biomass.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continued to raise soil pH; October 2001 values: limed plots ~6.19, Nitrogen & Lime plots ~6.38.
- Nitrogen addition alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed little change since baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) similar protocol to 2000; surveyors showed no significant difference in results between them.
- 2001 total hits were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting increased sward density, possibly due to the grazing stock removal in 1998.
- Treatment differences in dominant species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 (except remains most abundant in Control and Limed plots).
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen-only and Nitrogen + Lime plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) showed greater presence of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were prominent in fertilised plots.
- Diversity: unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) had 24 species; Nitrogen & Lime plots had 18 species, suggesting potential diversity decline with improved management.
- PCA (Point Quadrat) indicates clear separation of improved vs unimproved plots; unimproved plots cluster with species like Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum, while improved plots show increased Festuca rubra associations.
- Biomass correlates with species composition: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively correlates with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes tend to decline as biomass rises.
- Increased litter in plots with nitrogen and/or lime indicates faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity and Spatial Patterns

### 3.1 Variation in Surface Soil pH and Plant Community
- Spatial heterogeneity detected: columns E and F showed comparatively more acidic conditions than columns on the left side of the slope, with underlying patterns linked to plot treatment distribution.
- Nitrogen and/or Lime plots tended to have lower pH in certain columns, supporting the notion of spatially variable soil chemistry.

### 3.2 Variation in Vegetation Biomass
- Total biomass varied among plots; outliers with lower biomass tended to be scattered across various treatments.
- Higher biomass generally observed in more central site locations (e.g., Nitrogen + Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass (higher pH associated with higher biomass); no significant differences in biomass across blocks.

## Data Integration and Analysis Notes
- Data processed to enable cross-year comparisons, including normalization of biomass against control plots and transformation (e.g., log) for ANOVA.
- Botanical data analyzed via PCA to identify shifts in community composition related to treatments.
- Weather data integrated with site measurements to contextualize biological responses.

## Implications for GIS and Map-based Data Products
- Potential map layers:
  - Biomass by plot and by year (1999–2001), including cumulative sums.
  - Soil pH by plot and depth interval (0–5 cm) with lime and nitrogen treatment overlays.
  - Species distribution maps by plot (relative abundance of key taxa: Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Agrostis capillaris, etc.).
  - Vegetation turnover indicators (litter presence) linked to fertility treatments.
  - Spatial heterogeneity maps showing slope-column patterns (e.g., columns E/F vs others) and their association with pH and biomass.
  - Time-series maps or animations showing how biomass and pH co-vary across years and treatments.
- GIS analyses could explore: correlation between pH and biomass, treatment effects on species assemblages, and spatial auto-correlation of soil and vegetation metrics.
- Data quality and consistency considerations:
  - Changes in field personnel and harvesting method in 2001 affected biomass readings; normalization against C1 helps maintain comparability.
  - Spatial heterogeneity indicates that plots are not perfectly uniform; regionally varying factors (e.g., slope orientation) should be considered in spatial models.

## Endnotes
- Manuscript documents management interruptions (FMD restrictions) and personnel changes that influenced 2001 data collection.
- The dataset supports integrated, map-based exploration of how nitrogen, lime, and other treatments influence biomass, soil chemistry, and plant communities in a field-scale GIS context.
