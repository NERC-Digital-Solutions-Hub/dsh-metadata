# Rigg Foot topographical survey data, Sourhope Field Experiment Site, Scotland [Soil Biodiversity Programme] Mick Whelan and Stuart Bradley (University of Stirling)

## Summary
- Documents a topographic survey related to the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (established 1999) at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, where a major field experiment examined soil biodiversity and its functional roles.
- Describes the survey activities, data collected, data formats, and preliminary topographic maps, with emphasis on data provenance and potential uses in supporting soil biodiversity research.
- Highlights data governance and accessibility considerations, including quality assurance, metadata, and liability disclaimers from NERC.

## Background
- The NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme aimed to understand soil biota diversity and their functional roles in ecological processes.
- The Sourhope site hosted a large, intensive field experiment with 24 funded projects studying soil structure, carbon and nitrogen cycles, and organisms from bacteria to macro-fauna.
- A topographic survey of the Sourhope field site was conducted by Mick Whelan and Stuart Bradley (University of Stirling) on 4–6 April 2000 and 11–12 May 2000.
- Initial processing and re-orientation were performed using LISCAD; raw data and maps are provided for further analysis and cross-referencing with other data.

## Data Description
- Original survey data (x-y-z coordinates) collected in metres with an arbitrary altitude datum; coordinate system oriented so the bottom-left corner of plot 1A is at (1000, 1000) with the y axis upslope.
- Additional coordinates include approximate Easting and Northing (OSGB 1936), with descriptive notes on survey point locations.
- Altitude descriptions and units are provided in metres.

## File Details
- Rigg_foot_Topographic.csv: contains original survey data (x, y, z) with specified orientation and unit definitions.
- Rigg_foot_Topographic_newgrdxyz.csv: regular grid across the site at 25 cm intervals, with interpolated altitude values. Data represent x-y-z coordinates on a gridded lattice; interpolations performed in ArcView 3.1 on a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN); saved as ASCII grid and later as CSV.

## Site Level Maps
- Two initial topographic maps illustrate the site’s overall topography; interim results are noted.
- Higher-quality maps, including sub-plot boundaries within each treatment, are available in Rigg_Foot_Topo_maps.pdf.
- Maps include schematic references such as field boundaries and fencing.

## Data Quality, Access, and Use
- Data are subject to quality assurance procedures; however, NERC does not warrant their accuracy for any use and provides no liability for losses or damages arising from their use.
- The raw data are available for users to match with their own datasets or to conduct further analyses; maps accompany the data.
- The documentation emphasizes metadata details (coordinate orientation, datum, grid resolution, software used) to aid data provenance and reuse.
- Public sharing of underlying data is indicated, but readers should be aware of the accompanying disclaimers regarding accuracy and liability.

## Relevance to Monitoring Frameworks
- Illustrates practical data management for environmental monitoring: documenting data origins, coordinate systems, grid interpolation methods, and software used.
- Demonstrates the importance of clear metadata (coordinate definitions, units, datum, and point-location notes) to enable data reuse and integration with other datasets.
- Highlights governance considerations common to monitoring frameworks, including quality assurance, data sharing, and liability disclosures.

## Datasets Highlight
- Rigg_foot_Topographic.csv: original x-y-z survey data with spatial orientation details.
- Rigg_foot_Topographic_newgrdxyz.csv: 25 cm interval regular grid with interpolated altitude values.
