# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview and purpose
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive long-term field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) to provide context for broader studies and facilitate year-to-year data comparisons.
  - Aims to capture a broad monitoring context across multiple data types to support links with other datasets and help researchers interpret their own results.

- Experimental design and site context
  - Location: Sourhope field site, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, UK.
  - Treatments and structure: Control (two plots), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide; arranged across blocks with subplots and a standardized protocol for data collection.
  - Management context: 2001 influenced by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (visitors restricted Feb–May 2001); one site officer replaced in May 2001. Despite disruptions, key management activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued per plan. Biocide application in May 2001 was missed, but subsequent applications proceeded.
  - Data management: Weather data regularly downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at CEH, Merlewood.

- Data types and measurements collected (highlights)
  - Automatic Weather Station (2001 headline measures)
    - Rainfall around long-term average after very wet prior year; comparable radiation; slightly cooler temperatures; higher soil moisture compared with earlier years.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Regular harvests May–Aug; biomass peaks in July/August; 2001 shows a notable increase vs. previous years.
    - Normalization: biomass data standardized against the C1 (control) treatment to assess treatment effects; analysis used log-transformed weights for ANOVA.
    - Key finding: Nitrogen and Lime treatments increase biomass; Nitrogen+Lime often most effective.
  - Soil pH
    - Upper 5 cm: Lime markedly raises pH (October 2001 averages: 6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in Nitrogen+Lime plots); Nitrogen alone also raises pH modestly; control unchanged since baseline (1998).
  - Botanical composition
    - Point Quadrat surveys conducted July 2001; 24 species identified in unimproved plots vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime plots, suggesting possible biodiversity changes with higher fertility.
    - Dominant species and shifts: Agrostis capillaris declines in 2001 across all treatments; Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina increase and are more frequent in fertilized plots; Poa pratensis also more common in improved plots; indicators of pasture improvement trends.
    - Multivariate analysis: Principal Components Analysis separates nitrogen and/or lime plots from controls and biocide plots; unimproved plots show more bryophyte- and Nardus-striata-associated communities; higher biomass plots linked to Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
    - Biomass correlations: Higher biomass associated with increased presence of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with increasing biomass; litter increases in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, signaling faster vegetation turnover.
  - Site heterogeneity
    - Spatial patterns in pH and biomass observed (e.g., columns on the right flank tended to be more acidic and lower pH in nitrogen- and lime-improved plots).
    - Biomass distribution showed central plots typically higher; strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass overall.

- Data collection cadence and documentation
  - Table 1 details measurement types and dates (e.g., mowing periods, botanical surveys, soil sampling windows).
  - 16 July–3 August fieldwork included full botanical survey; 14–17 August included mini-rhizotron-related surveys; 22–24 August involved a disturbance/nutrient survey in sub-plot Y (Project-specific).
  - Weather data collection and transmission to CEH highlighted as a continuous data channel.

- Analysis methods and quality assurance
  - Biomass analysis: split-plot ANOVA on ln-transformed total biomass; significant effects for treatments, year interactions; blocks not significant.
  - Botanical data: point quadrat data analyzed via PCA; species abundance summarized by treatment and year; cross-year comparison of species abundance patterns.
  - Survey reliability: inter-surveyor comparison showed no significant difference between two surveyors in 2001 surveys, supporting data consistency.
  - Correlation analyses: biomass vs. species abundance and pH relationships explored to interpret ecological responses to treatments.

- Key findings and implications for data stewardship
  - Treatment effects: nitrogen and/or lime increase biomass and alter soil chemistry (pH) and plant community composition; combined nitrogen and lime often yields the strongest effect on productivity.
  - Biodiversity trends: enhanced plots show reduced species richness (fewer total species in Nitrogen+Lime plots) and shifts toward pasture-associated species; unimproved plots retain higher species diversity.
  - Biomass-pH relationship: higher pH generally supports higher biomass, with site heterogeneity modulating this relationship.
  - Data integration considerations: cross-year comparability achieved through standardized protocols, explicit normalization to C1, and consistent measurement windows; changes in measurement methods (e.g., mowing) and personnel influenced 2001 data interpretation and underscore the need for careful metadata documentation.
  - Site heterogeneity: spatial patterns in pH and biomass highlight the importance of accounting for micro-site variation when aggregating plot-level data.

- Data governance and future stewardship notes
  - Comprehensive metadata should accompany datasets to capture:
    - Temporal adjustments due to management disruptions (FMD restrictions, staff changes).
    - Exact mowing methods (manual vs mechanical), sampling dates, and sub-plot configurations to preserve comparability.
    - Data transmission pathways (e.g., weather data to CEH) and data quality checks (inter-surveyor reliability, transformation steps).
  - Data accessibility and traceability: link datasets across biomass, pH, and botanical surveys to enable integrative analyses (e.g., PCA loadings with biomass, pH-biomass correlations).
  - Documentation of species codes and taxonomic updates to maintain consistency with other site datasets (e.g., Ac, Ao, Fr, Poa spp., Festuca spp., etc.).

- Appendices and supporting material
  - Tables and figures (Tables 1–6; Figures 1–9) and Appendix 1 provide detailed annual biomass, pH, and botanical survey statistics and visualizations.
  - Species key and codes included to facilitate cross-dataset interpretation and reuse.
