# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report

- Four years into the Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on aboveground biomass production (productivity), plant community composition, and diversity at the Sourhope field site in the Scottish Borders.
- Three main management processes driving botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and lime), and insecticide application; trampling at C2 plots also implicated in productivity changes.
- Aim of the programme: link soil biodiversity to aboveground plant communities and ecological processes, recognising feedbacks between below- and above-ground systems.

## Site management and treatments

- Site-wide mowing: monthly cuts to approximately 6 cm from May to September.
- Insecticide treatment: Dursban 4 (chlorpyrifos) applied to insecticide plots after mowing.
- Fertility treatments: nitrogen and/or lime applied to designated plots each spring (two doses per year for nitrogen; lime applied once per year).
- Treatments include:
  - Control 1: no treatment
  - Control 2: no treatment
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Lime (L)
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Biocide prior label; now Insecticide plots)

## Methods and data collection

- Experimental design: Rigg Foot site with 5 replicate blocks across a downslope gradient; plots subdivided for 10 sub-plots and 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell mapping for groups.
- Data collection:
  - Automatic Weather Station for climate data since 1999.
  - Above-ground biomass: regular harvests from 0.5 m2 cells, dried and weighed.
  - Baseline and subsequent point analysis surveys (0.5 m2 cells; 25-point quadrats; 100-point frame in 2002) to record species at plot and sub-plot levels.
  - Soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe) measurements.
  - Bryophyte and vascular plant species lists; detailed Appendix records (Appendix 3).
- Research group activity: Phase I completed; Phase II fieldwork in 2002 included labelled 13CO2 pulses and trace gas measurements with CEH mobile labs.

## Key results: productivity, soil chemistry, and vegetation structure

- Above-ground biomass and treatments:
  - Fertilisation (N and/or lime) increases productivity; the highest biomass in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.
  - 2002 biomass across most treatments declined relative to 2001, with the largest drop in Control 2 plots; overall long-term increase in biomass since 1999 across treatments.
  - A clear slope-related pattern: lower biomass on Block 1 (bottom of slope) and greater reductions higher up (Block 5), indicating microsite effects.
  - Interaction between treatment and year is significant, indicating differing trajectories by treatment over time.
- Soil pH and moisture:
  - Lime dramatically increases soil pH toward 7.0 in the upper soil horizon; nitrogen has a smaller positive effect.
  - Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (r ≈ -0.68); improved plots tend to be drier.
  - Pinned relationships between soil pH and biomass: positive correlation when considering all plots, but treatment-specific patterns vary; in plots with both N and lime, the relationship can be negative, suggesting complex moisture-pH-biomass dynamics.
- Functional plant groups (CSR framework):
  - The community shifts from stress-tolerant (S) towards competitive-stress-ruderal combinations (CSR) and SR/CSR in fertilised plots, reflecting higher nutrient conditions enabling fast growth.
  - Unfertilised plots favor stress-tolerant species as disturbance is lowered and nutrients are lost with clipping.
  - Across years, CSR, S, and SR/CSR groups differ significantly between treatments; nitrogen and lime strongly influence functional group composition.
- Point analysis and species composition:
  - Two pasture-associated grasses (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) become more frequent in fertilised plots (N and Lime), dominating hits in N&L and Lime treatments relative to Control plots.
  - Unimproved plots (Control and Insecticide) show higher bryophyte abundance, notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, increasing across years.
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline substantially since 2000 across treatments, while Festuca ovina declines slightly and Festuca rubra increases, shifting community composition toward more fertile-associated grasses in fertilised plots.
  - Bryophytes rise in frequency on the whole site, with the increase most pronounced in unimproved plots; monocots decline relative to bryophytes in several untreated plots.
  - Litter/habitat structure shows differences by treatment appearing from 2001 onwards.
  - Shannon diversity index declines in the nitrogen-and-lime plots by 2002 relative to baseline, while unimproved plots show stable or increasing diversity.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the 2002 point analysis:
  - Treatment groups separate along axes, with lime-treated plots clearly grouped; some nitrogen-treated samples cluster with limed plots, while other nitrogen plots align more with controls or insecticide plots.
  - Species loadings distinguishfertile-associated taxa (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, Trifolium repens) from less fertile-associated taxa (Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp., Luzula spp.).
- Bryophyte dynamics:
  - Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) increase across treatments; Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus becomes more abundant, and bryophyte share of total hits grows from 2000 onward (notably in unimproved plots).
- Litter and dead vegetation:
  - 2000 shows no significant treatment differences in litter hits; 2001–2002 show higher litter hits in N&L plots, hinting at altered decomposition or surface cover with nutrient-rich conditions.
- Trampling effects:
  - The first year of C2 sampling in 2002 coincides with notable productivity declines in C2 plots, likely due to trampling during intense 13CO2 pulse activities.

## Discussion: interpretation and implications

- Mowing effect:
  - Consistent decline in Agrostis spp. since 2000 across all treatments; mowing likely reduces heterogeneity compared to prior grazing, favoring Festuca rubra and stress-tolerant species; bryophyte expansion is facilitated by a stable 6 cm sward height.
  - Disturbance reduction (loss of grazing) benefits stress-tolerant species and reduces SR/C-S-R taxa across treatments.
- Fertilisation effect:
  - Nitrogen and lime increase productivity, with the strongest response when combined; high lime applications elevate pH toward 7.0 and may increase water stress via reduced moisture content, potentially explaining some productivity declines in high-N/L plots.
  - The shift toward C-S-R communities under fertilisation indicates that faster-growing, high-nutrient–favoring species outcompete others under higher pH and nutrient regimes.
- Insecticide effect:
  - Insecticide results align with some literature that reduced herbivory can initially increase diversity, but direct causation remains uncertain; complex interactions mean benefits may accrue to multiple palatable species in a relatively infertile environment.
- Trampling/experimental activity:
  - C2 plot productivity declines likely linked to intensive fieldwork (13CO2 pulses) causing trampling; this effect appears in 2002 data and should be accounted for in interpreting 2002 biomass results.
- Overall patterns and management implications:
  - Fertilisation boosts productivity but tends to reduce diversity over time in treated plots; mowing and grazing exclusion promote stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities, potentially reducing vascular plant diversity.
  - Lime-driven pH increases shift functional composition toward competitive taxa; careful calibration of lime application is advisable to avoid excessive pH and moisture stress.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are inconclusive and require further targeted measurement to establish causal links.
  - Trampling and disturbance levels at high-activity plots can have substantial short-term productivity impacts and should be considered in experimental design and interpretation.

## Conclusions

- Fertilisation substantially enhances above-ground productivity, particularly when N and lime are applied together, but is associated with functional shifts toward competitive and ruderal taxa and a reduction in diversity in the longer term.
- Mowing and grazing exclusion promote stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities, with mosses expanding across the site; these changes tend to accompany decreased dominance of Agrostis spp. in favor of Festuca rubra in fertilised areas.
- Soil pH increases from lime, coupled with decreased soil moisture in fertilised plots, correlates with shifts in biomass production and community structure; the relationship between pH and productivity is treatment-dependent.
- The 2002 data show distinct treatment groupings in vegetation composition, with limed plots forming a clear cluster and nitrogen-treated plots partially clustering with limed plots; bryophyte increases are pronounced in unimproved plots.
- Overall, management decisions at Sourhope influence the balance between productivity and diversity, with clear trade-offs among nutrient enrichment, disturbance regime, and plant functional composition.
