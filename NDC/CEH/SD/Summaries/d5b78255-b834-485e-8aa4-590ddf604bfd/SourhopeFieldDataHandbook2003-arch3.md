# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Purpose and scope
  - Documentation of long-term environmental health monitoring at Sourhope, focusing on soil biodiversity, vegetation, and ecosystem processes to understand effects of management interventions and inform policy decisions.

- Site context and environment
  - Location: Sourhope Field, Sourhope, Scotland; north-facing slopes on the Rigg Foot site; high-altitude blocks with varying slope.
  - Climate and soils: Euoceanic, very humid climate; acidic brown forest soils with gleying in parts; underlying andesitic igneous rocks; gradient of moisture and soil properties across blocks.
  - Research network: Integrated with UK Environmental Change Network (ECN); linked to SERAD Micronet projects and long-standing collaboration with MLURI/Macauley Institute.

- Historical and program context
  - Evolved from hill sheep production and pasture management programs; hosted multidisciplinary studies on vegetation use, forage strategies, and genetic research.
  - Site serves as a core long-term platform for ecological and environmental monitoring aligned with biodiversity and climate-change research agendas.

- Experimental design and treatments (Sourhope Soil Biodiversity site)
  - Establishment and layout: Initiated in 1998 on a north-facing slope; five blocks (1–5) with thirty main plots (12 x 20 m) subdivided into fifteen subplots (4 x 4 m); Ecotron sub-plot (8 x 24 m) for controlled experiments.
  - Treatments: Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Lime + Nitrogen, Biocide, and Fallow (initially included but later omitted); management via periodic cutting; grazing largely excluded since 1997 with fencing.
  - Sampling regime: Regular plant sampling and soil monitoring across blocks and plots; perturbations implemented as combinations of treatments rather than single land-management simulations.

- Vegetation sampling and analysis
  - Method: 50 x 50 cm point quadrats randomly placed within five of the fifteen subplots per main plot; presence/absence data with potential abundance cues.
  - Key findings (Block 4 example): 25 species recorded; Agrostis capillaris dominant; richness increases downslope; vegetation aligns with National Vegetation Classification (primarily U4d with moister micro-sites showing U5b); multivariate analyses (Twinspan, indicator species) identify four main communities and key indicator species.
  - Data outputs: Species occurrence by plot, enabling assessment of spatial and block-level variation in vegetation composition.

- Soil sampling and analysis
  - Methods: August 1998 sampling with 30 cores per plot (0–30 cm) in a W-pattern; horizon-based pits excavated to 1 m for description; samples archived (-80°C) and analyzed for chemical and physical properties.
  - Measured parameters: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, K, Mg, Na; pH in H2O and CaCl2; %Moisture loss; Loss on Ignition (LOI); moisture content; horizon descriptors (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.).
  - Key findings: Soils acidic (low pH), humic, Ca-rich cations; surface horizons richer in organic matter with LOI highest near the surface; strong inter-relationships among carbon, nitrogen, moisture, and LOI; block-level differences with Blocks 3 and 5 often higher in several variables; Some plots show anomalous values requiring cautious interpretation.
  - Data interpretation: Principal components suggest that percent N, percent C, C:N, Ca, K, Mg, moisture loss, and LOI explain most variation; pH contributes less. Depth profiles show decreasing organic matter with depth and horizon-specific shifts in chemistry.

- Data management and accessibility
  - Archiving and metadata: Soil samples archived at -80°C; horizon-level descriptors, sampling schemes, and analytical methods documented in appendices and site reports; data organized by blocks, plots, and horizons.
  - Data sharing considerations: Data curated for internal research and cross-program use (ECN, SERAD) with extensive metadata; not strictly an open-data release, but designed for reproducibility, cross-study comparability, and reuse in monitoring frameworks.
  - Metadata and governance: Comprehensive horizon definitions, sampling depths, and analytical parameters to support reproducibility, provenance, and traceability from source material to published analyses.

- Implications for monitoring framework design
  - Robust experimental layout supports testing hypotheses on management effects on soil-vegetation dynamics and biodiversity, enabling policy-relevant insights.
  - Long-running infrastructure and data archiving (ECN integration, physical soil archives) demonstrate best-practice provenance, metadata richness, and cross-study comparability.
  - Combined use of vegetation classification (NVC/U4d, U5b) with soil chemistry and physical properties enables multi-factor environmental health indicators.
  - Documented data quality challenges (block anomalies, partial plot sampling, edge effects) highlight the need for explicit data governance, QA processes, and transparent reporting within monitoring frameworks.
  - Experience with data-sharing barriers underscores the importance of metadata, dataset discoverability, and standardized data management from collection to dissemination.

- Endnotes and supplementary context
  - The handbook weaves soil, vegetation, and environmental data within a multi-project research context (ECN, Micronet, SERAD), illustrating an integrated approach to environmental health monitoring and policy-relevant outcomes.
  - Appendices provide block-specific soil and vegetation data and detailed metadata to enhance long-term monitoring and data reuse for policy-informed decision-making.

- ECOTRON and supplementary plots
  - ECOTRON PLOT: dedicated sub-plot area with separate soil analyses and vegetation surveys; demonstrates controlled-environment experimentation within the monitoring framework.
  - Data components (ECOTRON): soil chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na), moisture loss, LOI, pH, and related metadata; vegetation data indicates species presence and counts analogous to field plots.

- Overall takeaway for monitoring frameworks
  - The Sourhope data demonstrate a comprehensive, multi-indicator approach to environmental health monitoring, combining long-term soil and vegetation datasets, controlled experiments, rigorous metadata, and established data governance to support policy-relevant evaluation and decision-making.
