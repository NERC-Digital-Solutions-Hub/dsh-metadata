# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while protecting survey integrity and landowner goodwill; only survey square location data and related spatial data within squares are confidential; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners, ensuring future survey permission and scientific integrity.

## Circumstances and precision for release
- Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to show which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: only under VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; applicant must prove that their data/IP carries equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps): treated as sensitive and released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- Processing option: CEH can pre-process analyses to avoid releasing precise locations; external requests may be considered under licence.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate purposes.
- Licences are finite, tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
- Upon license expiry, licensees must confirm data destruction.
- No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same IP confidentiality as six-digit releases; license terms prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences; decisions follow the UK FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing needs within reasonable timelines; external requests assessed case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using CS location data to define requirements or support appropriate use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid.

## Public interest and data availability
- Emphasis on public accessibility of all CS data except location data; location data access is tightly controlled to protect sampling integrity and landowner cooperation.
