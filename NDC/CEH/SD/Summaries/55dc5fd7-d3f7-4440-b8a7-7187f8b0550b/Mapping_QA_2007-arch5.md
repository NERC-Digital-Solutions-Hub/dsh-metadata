# Mapping Quality Assurance Exercise

- A 2007 Countryside Survey project evaluated the quality and interoperability of digital habitat and landscape data collected in the field.
- Goals included producing high-quality, rapidly analysable data in a geodatabase format suitable for integration with other national spatial datasets, and ensuring robust QA across large data holdings.
- The exercise compared data collected by surveyors (CS) with QA assessments (QA team) across multiple scales and methods to assess accuracy, consistency, and change reporting.
- Digital field mapping with mandatory fields, prompts, visit-status layers, and immediate wiki-based data checks supported improved data quality and traceability.
- The report documents methodology, results, issues, and recommendations for data governance, standards, and future enhancements.
