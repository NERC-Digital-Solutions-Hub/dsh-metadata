Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aim: maximize public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimizing risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public-interest rationale: confidentiality managed by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision level
- Allowed uses: identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing each square.
- Six-digit grid references: released only in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may preprocess to avoid release; external release requires strong legal assurances of equal/confidential IP protection.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.
- Any data release must not enable visits to CS squares or facilitate landowner oversight; no attempt to derive exact square locations from the data.

## Licensing terms and data handling
- Licences preserve confidentiality, require secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences finite in duration and project-specific; data must be destroyed at licence end; written confirmation required.
- No data released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Licences for four-digit releases have slightly less stringent IP safeguards than six-digit releases.
- License terms include a clause preventing attempts to identify square locations from released data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised signatory from the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under statutory Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- Reasonable pre-processing support from CEH may be provided within moderate demand; case-by-case for other organisations.
- Recommendation to consult with CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid as negotiated.

## Practical implications for data leaders
- Balances data utility with confidentiality to support policy-relevant analyses while protecting survey integrity.
- Defines clear access controls, licensing, and post-project data destruction requirements.
- Encourages early engagement with data custodians (CEH) to align needs with permissible use and processing options.
- Supports responsible data sharing within a cluster of partners and reduces risk of compromising future surveys.
