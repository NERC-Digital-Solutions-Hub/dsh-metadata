# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Describes how the ITE Land Classification has evolved and how it underpins the sampling framework.
  - Explains how time-series habitat and land-use data are collected, classified, and used to produce national and country-specific estimates.

- Core concept: Land Classification and stratified sampling
  - ITE Land Classification: stratifies GB into discrete land classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to ensure representative sampling.
  - Stratified sampling logic: aims to avoid bias from purely random sampling by ensuring coverage across diverse land types (strata) that differ ecologically.
  - Sampling unit: 1 km × 1 km squares across GB, with a system to classify and allocate samples within and across strata.

- Evolution of the sampling framework (historical timeline)
  - 1978 (first formal survey): development of the initial 32 Land Classes using centre squares of a 15 × 15 km grid, with additional surrounding squares classified; 256 samples surveyed (8 per class).
  - 1984: land-use survey using the same framework but increased sample size by 50% (12 squares per class; 384 total).
  - 1990: Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) introduces an “All Squares” Land Classification to classify every square in GB; 508 squares surveyed; continued use of the Land Classification for estimates.
  - 1998: Revised Land Classification to support Scotland-only reporting; number of classes increases to 40.
  - 2000: Countryside Survey CS2000 introduces separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland); Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata become 40–45; upland module added in subsequent steps; additional samples to ensure representation in Wales.
  - 2007: CS2007 adds Wales-only reporting refinements; introduces five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); increases strata to 45; adds 43 Welsh samples and adjusts English sampling; upland habitat module considered to improve country-specific estimates.

- Country-specific framing and adjustments
  - Separate country estimates: CS2000 establishes England with Wales and Scotland-based estimates, with class sub-division and aggregation to create 40 strata per country unit and additional sampling to ensure representation.
  - Wales-focused refinements (CS2007): increases Welsh sampling to support Wales-only reporting; creates Wales-specific sub-classes and ensures minimum sample counts per Welsh class.
  - England adjustments: maintains adequate representation across most classes; some English classes have smaller sample counts due to Welsh reallocation, deemed acceptable for reporting.

- Upland module and related enhancements
  - CS2000 adds an upland/marginal upland module to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.
  - The upland module contributes additional targeted squares (about 30) to bolster statistical accuracy for upland habitats.

- Sampling design details
  - GB-wide sampling plan is structured by Land Classes (strata), with a target number of squares per class to balance precision and resources.
  - Tables and figures in the document (e.g., Table 2, Table 3, Figure 4–7) detail the distribution of sample squares by class and country, and the maps of revised Land Classes and sample locations.
  - Example scale and outputs: totals and sampling rates are provided for each country and class, illustrating how national and regional estimates are derived from the sampled squares.

- National estimates methodology
  - Core calculation: for each Land Class, multiply the mean habitat area per square by the total area of that Land Class, then aggregate across classes to obtain national estimates.
  - Country-specific estimates: compute estimates within country units (England with Wales, Scotland) using only squares within the respective country, with sub-division/aggregation as needed to maintain representation.
  - Consistency note: changing the Land Classification between surveys affects cross-survey comparability; alternatives exist (latest classification vs. original 1990 classification). Preference is given to using the latest classification for internal consistency, while older classifications may be used for cross-survey comparisons.

- Outputs and data products
  - Land Class maps illustrating the revised classifications (England with Wales, Scotland).
  - Maps of Countryside Survey sample squares by country.
  - Tables detailing the number of squares surveyed per class and per country, sampling rates, and totals for CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
  - Scottish/English/Welsh stratification details to support country-specific estimates and policy reporting.
  - References to national estimates publications and related methodological work.

- Data quality, challenges, and considerations
  - Representativeness and bias: reliance on stratification to ensure typical coverage of ecological variation; adjustments over time to maintain adequate representation in each country.
  - Classification changes: updated Land Class schemes can distort comparability over time; the report discusses methods to preserve consistency or to document differences.
  - Wales-specific reporting needs: increased Welsh sampling and country-unit class subdivisions to support Wales-only environmental policy and legislation.
  - Patchy or inconsistent data: the document notes historical considerations around data availability and the need for robust sampling to minimize statistical error across land classes.
