# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations; applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- To protect the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports long-term ability to inform environmental policy; requests handled under FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Circumstances for release and precision levels

- General access: allows identifying whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) without revealing exact locations.
- Four-digit grid references: release permitted under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid in which a square lies.
- Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external users must demonstrate, legally, that their IP data requires equal or higher confidentiality than CS data; CEH may preprocess to avoid release.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps): equivalent risk to location data and released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
- Prevention clause: license terms prohibit using data to derive precise square locations or to identify CS squares.

## Specific conditions of release

- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must be destroyed at end of licensing period with written confirmation.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; cannot be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have IP confidentiality requirements that are less stringent than six-digit releases; four-digit data cannot be used to derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities and process

- CEH (on behalf of NERC) makes exceptional release decisions according to policy; issues hardcopy licences with terms signed by authorised representatives.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under relevant Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Within CS partnership, CEH aims to support pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Recommendation to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by the policy; CEH may assist as part of collaboration or as paid support.

## Practical guidance for potential users

- Contact CEH early to define requirements and ensure appropriate use of CS location data.
- Do not attempt to circumvent confidentiality or use data to infer precise square locations.
- If collaboration or licensing is pursued, ensure compliance with licence terms and destruction/release obligations at project end.
