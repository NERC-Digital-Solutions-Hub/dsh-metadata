# Landscape point feature data 2007 [Countryside Survey], Great Britain

## Overview
- Landscape point features collected in 2007 from 566 1km squares across Great Britain.
- Dataset version: 1: 04-2-2016; data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH).
- Purpose: Provides landscape-scale point feature data to inform environmental monitoring and framework development.

- Coding and naming: Many fields use codes (e.g., THEME, SPECIES, CANOPY_LIVE) with human-readable names provided in corresponding *_NAME fields.
- Scope: 1km square sampling; Year indicates survey year; data linked to land use, habitat classifications, veteran-tree attributes, epiphyte and ivy cover.

## Metadata, rights, and data sharing
- Acknowledgement: All uses of Countryside Survey data must acknowledge Countryside Survey data owned by NERC-CEH.
- Rights: Countryside Survey © Database Right/Copyright NERC-CEH. All rights reserved.
- Sharing: Underpins openness in data sharing, but public sharing of underlying datasets can be a barrier in some contexts.

## Data sources and governance
- Classifications: Draws on ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (Merlewood method) and related biodiversity classifications; links to broader habitat and land-cover frameworks.
- Provenance and references: Documents and methodologies are described on the Countryside Survey website; references include key publications from Bunce et al. (1996, 2007) and Jackson (2000), among others.
- Data management: Emphasises the need for clear metadata, data cleaning/transformation, and transparent data governance to ensure datasets meet standards and can be stored, shared, and updated.

## Usage considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Practical considerations for decision-makers:
  - Data quality and accessibility challenges: potential data gaps, data of insufficient standard, incompatible formats, and data silos between organisations.
  - Metadata adequacy: essential for verifying suitability and reuse.
  - Data sharing and governance: requires processes to ensure openness while respecting rights and provenance.
- Relevance to monitoring:
  - Provides rich, coded attributes for landscape features, including land use, habitat classification, veteran trees, canopy cover, epiphytes, and ivy cover, enabling integrated environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
