# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximises public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
  - Applies specifically to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- CS partners (as of policy)
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
  - Defra
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Critical for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
  - Public-interest rationale; handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 via CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners.

- When locations may be released and at what precision
  - Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to indicate which 10x10 km grid square a CS square falls in.
  - Six-digit grid references: required for precise location; released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances under licence with legal justification.
  - Within-survey-square spatial data (e.g., habitat maps): considered equivalent to location data and released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
  - In exceptional cases, CEH may perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing precise locations; external release requires demonstration that associated data/IP are equally or more confidential.

- Specific conditions of release (licence terms)
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, storage must be secure, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
  - Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
  - End-of-licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and have been destroyed.
  - No release to third parties that could compromise CS square confidentiality.
  - Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases, but do not require the same high IP-confidentiality criteria.
  - Users must not attempt to derive precise locations or claim they have done so.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases according to policy principles.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences reflecting policy terms; licences must be signed by an authorized senior signatory from the licensee organization.
  - If an approval is denied, CEH follows the Act and Regulations to support the decision.
  - CEH provides CS partners with an annual report summarising access applications, decisions, and rationale.
  - For internal CS-partner use, CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
  - Partners are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before committing to data covered by this policy; CEH may assist in defining requirements or supporting appropriate use, with potential collaboration or payment negotiated case-by-case.

- Practical guidance for data stewardship
  - Contact CEH early to understand licensing requirements and potential pre-processing options.
  - Maintain rigorous access controls, audit trails, and secure storage for any licensed location data.
  - Implement project-appropriate data handling to ensure compliance with JCOP or equivalent standards.
  - Plan for timely destruction and verification at the end of each licence period.
