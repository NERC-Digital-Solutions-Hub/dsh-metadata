# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Document outlines the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007 and its evolution over 30 years.
- Emphasizes continuity with earlier surveys to enable reliable time-series change detection.
- Core concept: use the ITE Land Classification as a stratification framework to ensure representative, unbiased sampling across Great Britain.

## Evolution of Land Classification and Sampling Framework
- Early development (1970s):
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to classify vegetation into 32 land classes from 1 km squares; sampling focused on centre squares of a 15x15 km grid.
  - Final design included 6039 km squares with 256 field survey squares (8 per class) for CS1978.
- 1984 land-use survey:
  - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (total 384) to cover land-use and habitat mapping.
- 1990 Countryside Survey (CS1990):
  - Land Classification revised to include all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; incorporated first Land Cover Map from satellite data.
- 1998 revision:
  - Updated Land Classification to 40 classes, enabling Scotland-only reporting; 569 squares surveyed.
- 2000 Countryside Survey (CS2000):
  - Framework adapted for separate England & Wales and Scotland estimates; introduced country-unit subdivisions and aggregations to ensure adequate representation; included uplands module for better country-specific accuracy.
- 2007 Countryside Survey (CS2007):
  - Further Welsh-specific adjustments for Wales-only reporting; created country-unit versions of select classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); increased Welsh samples to a minimum of 6 per Welsh class; maintained English representation with some classes still at 4 squares.
  - Resulted in 45 strata (from 40) and expanded Wales-focused sampling; maps and tables updated accordingly.

## Sampling Design and Data Outputs
- Stratified random sampling using the ITE Land Classification to divide GB into discrete strata.
- Sampling approach:
  - Center square method with additional surrounding squares classified for each centre square.
  - Historical emphasis on using representative strata to minimize sampling bias and improve national estimates.
- Data collected and outputs:
  - Field observations on vegetation, habitats, land use, and related environmental features.
  - Land Classification for each sampled square; ability to link results to the corresponding version of the classification.
  - National estimates calculated as mean habitat area per square within a class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - Tables (e.g., Table 2, Table 3) document the number of squares sampled per class and survey year; figures map the sampling framework and sample squares.

## Country-specific Reporting and Wales 2007 Adjustments
- Wales-focused reporting requirements prompted:
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit variants (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Increased total strata to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure adequate representation.
  - England adjustments to compensate for Welsh additions; some English classes retained with a smaller number of squares (4 in 2 classes).
  - Wales-specific sub-class representation to improve Wales-only estimates.
- Separate country estimates enabled by revised sampling maps for England with Wales and Scotland.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Implications
- Versioning and provenance:
  - Multiple iterations of the Land Classification (1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2000, 2007) require clear metadata about which version was used for any national estimate.
  - Documented decisions regarding class definitions, sub-divisions, and country-unit aggregations to preserve interpretability across time.
- Metadata and data management:
  - Essential to capture: survey year, country unit, Land Classification version, class assignments, square identifiers, strata, sampling rates, and surrounding-square classifications.
  - Mapping between different classification versions needed to maintain longitudinal comparability.
- Data availability and sharing:
  - Data underpin national habitat estimates and land-use change indicators; ensure accessible datasets with clear licensing, lineage, and methodological notes.
- Governance around updates:
  - Emphasis on documenting updates to classifications and sampling frames (e.g., upland modules, Wales adjustments) and their impact on comparability.
- Data quality and interoperability:
  - Use of stratified sampling reduces bias; maintain standardized data collection protocols, with clear recording of methods such as ISA-based classification, centre-square methodology, and satellite-derived inputs.

- Key note on consistency: changing Land Classification for national estimates affects cross-survey comparability; prefer consistency within a survey while allowing cross-survey comparisons using documented correspondences.
