# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Outlines the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its application as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) from 1978 to 2007.
  - Emphasises that the current CS methodology is built on decades of prior work and is essential for time-series change detection.

- Core concept: stratified random sampling with the ITE Land Classification
  - Samples are drawn from land classes that represent ecological and land-use variation across Great Britain.
  - Stratification reduces bias and improves representativeness compared with purely random sampling.
  - The Land Classification translates environmental attributes into discrete classes used to allocate samples.

- Development of the ITE Land Classification (historical trajectory)
  - 1978: First full GB application using 32 classes, based on environmental attributes; centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid classified, plus surrounding squares.
  - 1984: Land-use focus expanded; sample size increased to 12 squares per class, total 384.
  - 1990: All GB 1 km squares classified; Land Cover Map linked; 508 squares surveyed; urban/sea corrections incorporated; original 32 classes extended.
  - 1998–2000: Revision to enable Scotland-only reporting and separate country estimates; Land Classes increased to 40; framework adjusted for England, Scotland, and Wales.
  - 2007: Wales-only reporting requirements drive further refinements; country-unit sub-divisions create five new Welsh classes; total of 45 strata; additional Welsh squares added; English sampling slightly reduced in some classes.

- Sampling framework across CS milestones
  - CS1978 (Initial survey)
    - 8 samples per Land Class; total 256 1 km squares.
    - Objective: national estimates of habitat areas derived from mean habitat area per square within each class.
  - CS1984 (Second field survey)
    - 12 squares per Land Class; total 384.
  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification)
    - Extended to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; repeat of certain vegetation measures; linked to first Land Cover Map.
  - CS2000 (Separate country estimates)
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata.
    - 19 additional squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; additional sampling to Wales to improve Wales reporting; uplands module added for better upland habitat estimates.
  - CS2007 (Welsh reporting and refinement for Wales/England)
    - Wales-specific class subdivisions (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 45 strata total.
    - 43 extra squares in Wales to ensure minimum representation per Welsh class; minor reduction in some English classes’ sample counts deemed acceptable.
    - Wales becomes the focus for country-specific habitat reporting; England and Scotland remain monitored with adjusted allocations.

- Country-specific reporting and upland emphasis
  - Separate country estimates were introduced to provide England-with-Wales and Scotland-specific outputs.
  - Upland habitats receive targeted sampling (CS2000 uplands module) to improve statistical precision where under-sampling could occur.

- Data management, comparability, and reporting considerations
  - Shifts in Land Classification across surveys create challenges for cross-survey comparability; the 2006 scoping study notes the need to balance consistency with the benefits of updated classifications.
  - National estimates can be derived using either the latest country-specific classifications or the original classification; for consistency within a survey, the latest approach is preferred.
  - Outputs include tabulated sample counts by class and country, stratum areas, and the methodology for converting square-level data into national habitat estimates.
