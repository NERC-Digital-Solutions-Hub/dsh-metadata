# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim
  - Maximise public-interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

- Partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (via CEH)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England (NE)
  - Welsh Government (WG)
  - The Scottish Government (SG)
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
  - Forestry Commission (FC)
  - Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
  - Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and continued permission to survey land.
  - Confidentiality considered in the public interest; requests handled under UK FOI Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Release circumstances and precision
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise five- or six-figure locations) are only possible in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must be justified legally that accompanying data/IP requires equal or higher confidentiality.
  - Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases but still require licensing terms to prevent locating squares.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are for finite periods and for specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
  - End of licensing period requires written confirmation of data destruction and continued confidentiality.
  - No data or derivatives should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP may be required.
  - Four-digit releases: similar licensing terms but not require the same level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases; include a clause preventing attempts to derive precise locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and process
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate confidentiality clauses; licences must be signed by a senior authorised official.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential data users are strongly advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
