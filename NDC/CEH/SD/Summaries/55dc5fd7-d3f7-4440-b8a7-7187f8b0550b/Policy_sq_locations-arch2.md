# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- This policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares, aiming to maximise public-interest utility of CS data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity. All other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for the survey’s scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality is deemed in the public interest; requests are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When locations may be released and at what precision

- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares): may be released under licence to identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references: only in very exceptional circumstances; applicant must show, legally, that their data or models have equal or higher confidentiality than CS data and cannot be released to CEH for processing with CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps): treated as equivalent to location data and released only under the same exceptional circumstances as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release

- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- At license end, organizations must confirm destruction of data.
- No data or outputs should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; if in doubt, consult CEH.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality; there is a clause preventing attempts to deduce exact square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with clauses reflecting this policy; licenses must be signed by an authorized representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under FOI/Regulations processes.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to offer reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; other organizations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult with CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be via collaboration or payment, negotiated case-by-case.
