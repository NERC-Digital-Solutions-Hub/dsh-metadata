# Landscape point feature data 2007 [Countryside Survey], Great Britain

## Overview
- Landscape point features collected from 566 1km squares across Great Britain in 2007.
- Data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH); Version 1: 04-02-2016.
- Data usage requires explicit acknowledgement of Countryside Survey (CS) data ownership and copyright.

## Data content and structure
- File: LANDSCAPE_PT_FEATURES_2007.csv
- Key columns and meanings:
  - SQUARE: 1km square sampling site code
  - YEAR: Year of survey (2007)
  - ID: Landscape point identifier (unique within a year)
  - THEME / THEME_NAME: Theme code and name
  - PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTE / PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTE_NAME: Primary attribute code and description
  - SPECIES / SPECIES_NAME: Species code and name
  - PROPORTION / PROPORTION_RANGE: Species cover code and range
  - USE / USE_NAME: Land-use/structures theme code and description
  - BUFFER: Buffer around veteran tree or pond
  - VETERAN_TREE_*: Attributes for veteran trees (e.g., TREE_DEAD, MISSING_LIMBS, DEAD_WOOD, DEAD_MISSING_BARK, LIGHTNING_STRIKES, HOLLOW_TRUNK, MODAL_DBH / MODAL_DBH_RANGE, VETERAN_TREE_TYPE / NAME)
  - EPIPHYTE_COVER / EPIPHYTE_COVER_NAME: Epiphyte cover code and description
  - IVY_COVER / IVY_COVER_RANGE: Ivy cover code and range
  - CANOPY_LIVE / CANOPY_LIVE_RANGE: Percent canopy live
  - LC07 / LC07_NUM: ITE Land Classification of Great Britain 2007 (codes)
  - COUNTRY / COUNTY07: Location by country and county/region
  - EZ_DESC_07: Countryside Survey Environmental Zone description
- Theme and attribute codes link to broader standard classifications used in Countryside Survey analyses (e.g., Land Classification, biodiversity-related attributes).

## Purpose and how it supports monitoring
- Enables analysis of environmental health and habitat structure across GB at a standardized 1km scale.
- Supports categorisation of environmental features against classifications and standards (e.g., land class, canopy cover, veteran trees).
- Outputs can be presented as reports, maps, and charts; designed for integration into larger CS datasets and portals.

## Data quality and standards
- Data are verified, quality-assured, and transformed to fit standardized monitoring workflows.
- Collected as part of the Countryside Survey program to enable temporal monitoring and cross-site comparisons.

## Access, usage rights, and acknowledgements
- All Countryside Survey data must be acknowledged in outputs.
- Acknowledgement statement: Countryside Survey data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology; CS copyright applies.
- Data should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals as part of dataset management.

## Relevance for analysts monitoring the environment
- Provides multivariate landscape data (land use, veteran trees, epiphytes, ivy, canopy, biodiversity indicators) across GB.
- Facilitates standardised temporal and spatial comparison for environmental policy performance and habitat monitoring.
- Useful for integrating with other CS datasets to enhance value beyond single-use analyses.
