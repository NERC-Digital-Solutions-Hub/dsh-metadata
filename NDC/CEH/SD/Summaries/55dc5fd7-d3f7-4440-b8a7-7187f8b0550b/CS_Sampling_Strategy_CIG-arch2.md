# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Describes the sampling strategy used for the Countryside Survey field element up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification, a long-running stratification system initiated in 1978.
  - Aims to support time-series monitoring of environmental features and policy-relevant habitat estimates across Great Britain.

- Key concepts and foundations
  - Stratified sampling to ensure representative coverage of diverse land types and ecological conditions.
  - ITE Land Classification: environment-based classification developed from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to create land classes.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used in early development to cluster quadrats into land classes.
  - Sample units: 1 km squares chosen to be representative of the land class and GB as a whole.
  - Early approach used centre squares of a 15×15 km grid; surrounding squares were also classified to extend the framework.

- Evolution of the sampling framework and land classification
  - 1978 (CS1978): First GB-wide framework using 32 Land Classes; 8 samples per class; total of 256 squares surveyed.
  - 1984 (CS1984): Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); framework based on the original 32 classes.
  - 1990 (CS1990): Land Classification updated to cover all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; addition of Land Cover mapping; results published as Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - 1998/2000 (CS2000): Land Classification extended to classify every GB square; introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales; Scotland); new 40 classes; revised maps; additional sampling to ensure national representation; uplands habitat module considered for England and Wales to improve upland estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting needs led to further Wales-focused refinements; Welsh sub-divisions created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 45 strata overall; additional Welsh squares added to ensure adequate representation; removal of some Welsh squares from England framework and adjustments to England’s sampling in response; total GB sample squares increased to 591.

- Country-unit framework and sampling adjustments
  - Separate country estimates implemented to provide England with Wales together and Scotland-specific results.
  - Land Classes sub-divided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to reflect country-specific reporting needs.
  - Aggregation of under-represented sub-sets to maintain robust estimates within each country unit.
  - Isle of Man adjustments: existing squares removed and replaced to support country-based reporting.

- Upland habitats module
  - Added in CS2000 as an additional survey module funded to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.

- Sample sizes and coverage (high-level)
  - CS1978: 256 squares surveyed (8 per Land Class; 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 squares surveyed (12 per class; same 32 classes).
  - CS1990: 508 squares surveyed; all GB squares classified; expansion to include Land Cover data.
  - CS2000: 569 squares surveyed; country-unit framework implemented; 40 classes (before Welsh refinements).
  - CS2007: 591 squares surveyed; 45/46 strata (depending on class subdivision); Wales emphasized with 43 additional Welsh squares; England adjusted accordingly.

- How estimates are produced
  - National estimates based on the Land Classification: for each class, multiply the mean habitat area per square by the total area of that class, then aggregate across classes.
  - Country-unit estimates derive from squares within the corresponding country, with adjustments for class representation.
  - Tables and maps present the distribution of sample squares, class areas, and the sampling rates (1:x) by survey and by country.

- Outputs and outputs format
  - Time-series data on habitat areas and land cover derived from standardized sampling and classification.
  - Reports and maps feature the distribution of Land Classes, sample locations, and estimated habitat extents.
  - Emphasis on ensuring comparability over time while accommodating country-specific reporting needs.

- Notable considerations and notes
  - Changing the Land Classification affects the comparability of national estimates; the project notes the trade-off between using the latest classification for internal consistency and maintaining cross-survey comparability.
  - The framework’s design prioritizes representative sampling across diverse GB landscapes and supports policy-relevant environmental monitoring at national and country levels.

  - References document the methodological developments, applications, and successive survey results.

- Practical relevance for environment monitoring analysts
  - Provides a rigorous, time-series-friendly sampling framework anchored in stratified, land-class-based sampling.
  - Demonstrates how to balance national consistency with country-specific reporting (England & Wales; Scotland).
  - Illustrates iterative methodological refinement (land classification, sample allocation, uplands module) to improve precision of habitat estimates over time.
