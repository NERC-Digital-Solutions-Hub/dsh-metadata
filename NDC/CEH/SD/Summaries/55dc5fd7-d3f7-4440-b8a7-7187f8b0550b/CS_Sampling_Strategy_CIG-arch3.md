# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Purpose and scope
- Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
- Builds on the ITE Land Classification to provide a representative, stratified sampling framework across Great Britain for monitoring habitat change and informing policy.
- Demonstrates the evolution of sampling design across successive CS surveys and how classification updates affect national estimates.

## Core concepts: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling
- Stratified (non-rleider) sampling is used to ensure representative coverage of GB land types and reduce bias.
- ITE Land Classification classifies land into discrete environmental strata based on factors like altitude, geology, climate, and land use.
- Early approach (1978) used 32 land classes; later expansions increased to 40 (1990) and then 45 (2007), with refinements to support country-specific reporting.
- Sampling units are 1 km squares; the initial strategy classified a subset of squares and used surrounding squares to extend representation.
- For national estimates, habitat areas are derived from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.

## Timeline of key developments

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 Land Classes from environmental data for 1228 central 1 km squares (plus surrounding 4 squares per center, total 6039 squares classified).
  - Field survey: 8 squares per Land Class (256 total).
  - National habitat estimates calculated by multiplying mean habitat area per square by land-class area.

- 1984 (Second field survey)
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per Land Class (384 total), with results published as Landscape Changes in Britain.
  - Estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification framework.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
  - First Land Cover Map of GB linked to the program; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
  - National estimates recalculated using the All Squares classification; some squares reclassified, but overall class means preserved.

- 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000; fourth field survey)
  - Recognition of need for separate England & Wales vs Scotland estimates; 40 Land Classes introduced.
  - Changes to sampling framework to enable “country unit” estimates; 19 additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes.
  - Introduction of a uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
  - Wales-specific adjustments increased Welsh sampling to support Wales-only reporting.

- 2007 (Countryside Survey 2007; fifth field survey)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements drove further class subdivisions into country-unit versions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), creating 45 strata.
  - Additional Welsh squares (to a minimum of 6 per Welsh class); England adjustments to maintain balanced representation where Welsh squares were removed.
  - England, Scotland, and Wales sampling maps and class maps updated accordingly to support country-specific estimates.

## Sampling framework details
- Original approach used a centre-square sampling frame within a 15 km grid, with surrounding squares assigned to the same Land Class, enabling broad geographic coverage.
- The Land Classification is the backbone for stratification and for calculating national estimates by weighting class areas with per-square habitat means.
- By CS2000, the framework expanded to 40 strata with separate country units; CS2007 extended to 45 strata with additional Welsh-specific subdivisions.

## National and country-specific estimates
- National estimates are based on the Land Classification framework and the distribution of squares across classes.
- England & Wales and Scotland estimates can be produced separately; Wales required more granular Welsh-class subdivisions for Wales-only reporting.
- The methodology notes that changing Land Class definitions over time affects consistency of national estimates; the preferred approach for a given survey is to use the latest classification for that survey, while cross-survey comparability may require aligning to earlier classifications.

## Wales and upland emphasis
- Wales-specific adjustments became a focal point for CS2007 to enable Wales-only reporting, including additional Welsh squares and Welsh sub-classifications.
- The uplands module introduced in CS2000 (and applied in later surveys) targeted improved statistical accuracy for upland habitats through extra sampling in upland and marginal upland Land Classes.

## Data presentation and references
- Results have been published in successive Countryside Survey reports (CS1990 main report; CS2000 summary; CS2007 UK results), with detailed tables showing the distribution of sample squares by class and country unit.
- The documentation emphasizes consistency considerations when applying different Land Class frameworks across surveys and the need to maintain robust representations of each country’s land types.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- The Countryside Survey sampling strategy demonstrates how to:
  - Develop a robust, stratified sampling framework tied to a coherent land classification.
  - Adapt sampling design to support country-specific policy needs (England, Wales, Scotland).
  - Balance the desire for detailed, class-based estimates with the practicalities of sample size and representation, including upland and rural distinctions.
  - Manage the impact of classification updates on longitudinal estimates and ensure transparency about changes in methodology.
