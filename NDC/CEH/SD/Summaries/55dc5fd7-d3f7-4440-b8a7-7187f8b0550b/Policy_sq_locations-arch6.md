# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: Maximise the public benefit and utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

- Current CS partners:
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
  - Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England (NE)
  - Welsh Government (WG)
  - The Scottish Government (SG)
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
  - Forestry Commission (FC)
  - Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
  - Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

- Why locations are confidential:
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permissions
  - Public release could compromise future surveys and policy relevance

- How requests are handled:
  - Requests dealt with by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004

- Circumstances for releasing locations and precision:
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable
  - Six-digit grid references released only in very exceptional circumstances; applicant must demonstrate, legally, that associated IP data carries equal or higher confidentiality than CS data
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases

- Specific conditions of release:
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals
  - Licences are finite in duration and for specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end
  - No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could disclose square locations
  - Data must not be used to visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance
  - If requested, evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP may be required
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms, but less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases
  - License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from the data

- Responsibilities:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licenses with appropriate clauses
  - Denied requests follow formal Act and Regulation procedures
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds
  - CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS use; external requests handled case-by-case
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to using data covered by the policy; CEH involvement may be direct or advisory and is negotiated case-by-case
