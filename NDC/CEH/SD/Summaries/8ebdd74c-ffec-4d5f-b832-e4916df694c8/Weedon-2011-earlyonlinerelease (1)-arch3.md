# Creation of the WATCHForcing Data and its use to assess global and regional reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century

## Overview
- Presents WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) used to drive land surface models (LSMs) and hydrological models across the 20th century.
- Provides comparisons between PET_rc (reference crop Penman–Monteith) and PET_PT (Priestley–Taylor) across multiple basins and time periods.
- Documents time-sliced trends (1901–1957, 1958–2001, 1979–2001) for key variables and their uncertainty.
- Includes extensive basin-level results, data provenance notes, and an appendix detailing ERA-40 basis-year ordering to support reproducibility and monitoring-frame work.

  - PET_rc slopes: negative in 1958–2001 and 1979–2001, indicating a decrease in PET_rc with time
  - PET_PT: 1901–1957 average 798.70; 1958–2001 average 767.99; 1979–2001 average 752.00
  - PET_PT slopes: negative across late periods, indicating reduced PET_PT with time
  - Net Radiation: ~69–79 W/m2 with slight declines in later periods
  - VPD: around 0.95–1.0 kPa, with a slight decreasing trend in later windows
  - Wind: ~1.9–2.0 m/s; Rainfall: ~1390–1430 mm/yr (late-period data show higher variability)
  - Snowfall: small amounts; generally minor relative to rainfall
  - Notes: Clear regional differences with declines in PET metrics during later periods, while precipitation shows substantial interannual variability

- Appendix: ERA-40 basis-year ordering
  - Provides the mapping and sequence of ERA-40 years used as basis years in the WATCH Forcing Data for 1901–1957, enabling reproducibility and traceability of the data generation process

## Variables and time periods (key elements)
- Forcing and derived variables included (across basins and periods):
  - PET_rc (mm/yr): Penman–Monteith reference-crop evapotranspiration
  - PET_PT (mm/yr): Priestley–Taylor alternative
  - Net Rad (W/m2): net radiant flux
  - VPD (kPa): vapor pressure deficit
  - Wind (m/s)
  - Rainfall (mm/yr)
  - Snowfall (mm/yr)
- Time periods analyzed:
  - 1901–1957
  - 1958–2001
  - 1979–2001
- For each basin, the data provide:
  - Annual averages (where available)
  - Slopes (units/yr) for each period
  - Min and max slope bounds
  - Neff (effective sample size)
  - P-values indicating adjusted slope significance (Adjusted Slope P.)

## Data governance, availability, and reproducibility
- WATCH data are designed to be robust, bias-corrected, and suitable for long-term environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Data and methodology are documented to support transparency, reproducibility, and auditability for monitoring frameworks.
- Appendix and accompanying documentation provide provenance details (e.g., ERA-40 basis-year ordering) and data-correction procedures.
- Data are intended to be publicly accessible via the EU-WATCH portal and related technical reports (e.g., WATCH Technical Report 22).

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- The basin-level results illustrate substantial regional heterogeneity in evaporative demand and moisture balance, even when global signals are weak or ambiguous.
- The use of PET_rc versus PET_PT yields notably different magnitudes and trends, underscoring the importance of method choice for evaporative-demand assessments in policy-relevant monitoring.
- Availability of multi-decadal forcing data with consistent processing and metadata is essential for evaluating policy scenarios, water-resource planning, and environmental health indicators.
- Uncertainties remain, particularly for early periods and basins with sparse observations; robust data governance and metadata sharing are crucial to enable replication and credible decision-making.
