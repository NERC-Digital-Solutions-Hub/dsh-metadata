# Creation of the WATCH Forcing Data and its use to assess global and regional reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century.

## Overview
- Provides a bias-corrected, 0.5-degree gridded meteorological forcing dataset for driving land surface and hydrological models across the 20th century.
- Enables analysis of evaporation and its drivers with sub-daily (3-hourly) detail and spatially explicit map-based representations.
- Data are designed for GIS analysts and hydrologists to build map-based data products and long-term climate analyses.

## Data Variables and Format
- Meteorological forcing variables include:
  - Wind speed at 10 m, air temperature at 2 m, surface pressure, specific humidity at 2 m
  - Downward longwave and shortwave radiation, rainfall rate, snowfall rate
- Temporal and storage characteristics:
  - Interpolated to 3-hourly time steps (for radiation, rainfall, snowfall) with some variables stored at 6-hourly to save space
  - Global data stored on 67,420 land grid points (CRU land-sea mask; Antarctic excluded)
  - NetCDF format using the ALMA convention
- Coverage and periods:
  - Primary: 1958–2001
  - Secondary: 1901–1957 (generated by re-ordering ERA-40 data to preserve diurnal-to-seasonal characteristics)

## Temporal and Spatial Coverage
- Spatial: global 0.5° grid over land
- Time periods:
  - 1958–2001 (primary)
  - 1901–1957 (secondary, pre-1958)
- Data generation approach:
  - 1958–2001 based on ERA-40 reanalysis with elevation and bias corrections
  - 1901–1957 data produced by re-ordering ERA-40 years to maintain statistical properties
  - Year-end discontinuities smoothed with ramping adjustments (1902–1957)

## Data Generation, Corrections, and Biases
- Corrections and methods:
  - Interpolation from ERA-40, elevation corrections (temperature, pressure, humidity, longwave radiation)
  - Bias corrections to align with CRU and GPCCv4 climatologies
  - Shortwave radiation corrected for aerosols and cloud cover using CRU data and HadGEM2-A aerosols
  - Longwave radiation largely bias-corrected through climatology consistency; not universally bias-corrected to SRB
  - Precipitation refined by adjusting wet-day counts to CRU and reconciling GPCC totals; rain/snow allocation based on ERA-40-derived proportions
  - Designed to preserve large-scale spatial coherence of precipitation events across grid boxes
- PET (potential evapotranspiration) metrics:
  - PET rc (Penman–Monteith) with fixed rs and ra
  - PET PT (Priestley–Taylor) as a radiation-based alternative
  - Comparisons illustrate sensitivity of PET estimates to formulation (rc vs PT) across basins

## PET Metrics and Interpretation
- PET rc and PET PT are used to interpret potential evapotranspiration and its drivers
- rc-based PET tends to exceed precipitation in arid regions; PT can differ significantly in some basins
- Baseline and regional trends are examined to understand how PET and moisture balance evolve under changing forcing

## Regional Basin Findings (Examples)
- The dataset includes basin-scale statistics for multiple basins, with entries such as:
  - Orange River Basin: PET rc and PET PT values across 1901–1957, 1958–2001, and 1979–2001; Net Rad and VPD trends; Wind and Rainfall; Snowfall; Neff counts and significance levels
  - Murray-Darling River Basin: PET_rc and PET_PT trajectories and related radiation, VPD, wind, rainfall, and snowfall indicators across periods
  - Lena River Basin: PET_rc trends, Net Rad, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, and Precipitation across 1901–1957, 1958–2001, and 1979–2001
  - Ganges–Brahmaputra River Basin: similar multi-variable, multi-period statistics
- Each basin section reports:
  - Average values for each variable and period
  - Slope (trend) with min/max bounds
  - Neff (effective sample size) and adjusted P-values indicating significance
- Interval-specific trends (e.g., 1901–1957, 1958–2001, 1979–2001) illustrate regional responses in PET_rc, PET_PT, Net Rad, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, and Snowfall

## Validation, Uncertainties, and Caveats
- FluxNet validation:
  - Seven flux towers used for comparison with three-hourly WFD fields
  - Temperature, humidity, and radiative fluxes show good agreement; precipitation validation shows more limitations and lag correlations
  - Spatial coherence of precipitation events is preserved, but local/topographic biases exist
- Uncertainties:
  - ERA-40-based data pre-1958 carry biases in surface pressure, wind, and other fields
  - Sparse meteorological stations before 1950 lead to uncertainties, especially for precipitation
  - Pre-1958 variability in PET_rc may reflect the data generation approach rather than historical reality
  - Wet-day corrections can introduce outliers in some grid boxes
- WFD aims to capture forcing characteristics and diurnal/seasonal patterns rather than precise site-specific historical events

## GIS Usage and Access
- Practical GIS relevance:
  - Provides gridded, sub-daily meteorological forcing suitable for driving GIS-based land surface and hydrological models
  - Enables spatially explicit analyses of evaporation drivers, moisture, and runoff across the 20th century
- Data characteristics for GIS workflows:
  - 0.5° grid, global land mask, NetCDF format, and well-documented metadata
  - Diurnal-to-sub-daily variability captured for key variables
  - Availability of both late-20th-century (1958–2001) and pre-1958 (1901–1957) datasets for long-term analyses
- Data accessibility:
  - Distributed by the WATCH project; referenced with EU-WATCH technical materials

## Appendix Note
- Appendix Table 1 documents the order of ERA-40 basis years used in WATCH Forcing Data (1901–1957), illustrating the mapping between ERA-40 and WFD basis years across multiple calendar years

## Key Takeaways for GIS Specialists
- The WATCH Forcing Data delivers a robust, bias-corrected, 0.5° gridded forcing dataset suitable for GIS-based mapping and long-term analyses of evaporation and its meteorological controls across the 20th century.
- It supports global and regional assessments of PET_rc and PET_PT, with explicit consideration of radiation, moisture, and diurnal variations, while clearly outlining regional uncertainties.
- While validated against flux towers and designed to preserve spatial coherence, users should account for pre-1958 data limitations and tropical precipitation representations when interpreting results.
- For GIS workflows, the data provide ready-to-use, map-friendly forcing fields to build, compare, and visualize map-based representations of evaporation dynamics over time.
