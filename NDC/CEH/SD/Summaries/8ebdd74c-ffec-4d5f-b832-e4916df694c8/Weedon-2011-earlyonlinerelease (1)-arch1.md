# Creation of the WATCHForcing Data and its use to assess global and regional reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century.

## Overview of the Appendix Segment
- Presents basin-scale, century-spanning statistics extracted from the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) for key meteorological and evapotranspiration-driving variables.
- Variables covered include PET rc, PET PT, Net Radiation, Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD), Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, and Precipitation.
- Basins included in this segment: Orange River Basin, Murray-Darling River Basin, Lena River Basin, and Ganges-Brahmaputra River Basin (with detailed per-period results).
- Time periods reported: 1901–1957, 1958–2001, and 1979–2001, with per-variable averages, slopes (and their ranges), Neff (effective sample size), and Adjusted Slope P values indicating significance.

## Key Basin Findings (per variable and period)
- PET rc (reference crop evapotranspiration via Penman–Monteith)
  - Basin-level trends are variable and strongly period- and basin-dependent.
  - Example pattern (qualitative): some basins show modest increases in PET rc across the early to mid-20th century with changes into 1958–2001 and 1979–2001, while others exhibit declines or non-significant trends in later periods.
- PET PT (Priestley–Taylor reference)
  - Tends to show positive trends in several basins across the periods, indicating increases driven by radiation and humidity components in many regions.
- Net Radiation
  - Generally remains in a modest range (with small increases or stable values across the periods); patterns are basin-specific.
- VPD (Vapour Pressure Deficit)
  - In most basins, VPD shows an upward tendency over time, reflecting warming and humidity changes, though the magnitude and significance vary by basin and period.
- Wind
  - Wind speeds are relatively stable in many basins, with modest inter-period variations; some basins show slight increases or decreases across periods.
- Rainfall
  - Signals are regionally diverse:
    - Some basins experience increases in late-period rainfall (1958–2001 and/or 1979–2001) with positive slopes.
    - Other basins show weaker or fluctuating trends, including periods of little change or declines in certain intervals.
- Snowfall
  - Generally small across the basins; changes are noticeable in some periods but often with limited magnitude.
- Precipitation (total)
  - Across basins, precipitation shows mixed trajectories, with some basins displaying increases in certain periods and others showing stability or declines.
- Neff and Significance
  - Neff values (effective sample sizes) vary by basin and period, reflecting data gaps and aggregation choices.
  - Adjusted Slope P values indicate which trends are statistically significant; many trends are modest or not statistically significant, while some periods/basins exhibit significant changes.

## Appendix Table 1: ERA-40 Basis Years Order
- Documents the specific mapping/order of ERA-40 basis years used to construct the WFD for 1901–1957.
- WFD, 1 = ERA-40; WFD, 2 = WFD; WFD, 3 = ERA-40; WFD, 4 = WFD; WFD, 5 = ERA-40.
- Provides the year-to-basis-year assignment for each calendar year from 1901 to 1957 (e.g., 1901 uses basis year 1974, 1920 uses basis year 1920, etc.), illustrating how interannual variability from ERA-40 is embedded into the century-spanning extension.

## Notes on Usage and Interpretation (Analysts’ Perspective)
- The table-based presentation supports cross-basin comparisons of PET rc vs. PET PT and of driver variables (Net Rad, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, Precipitation) across 1901–1957, 1958–2001, and 1979–2001.
- Basin-specific trends should be interpreted with attention to data quality and sampling (Neff) as well as the statistical significance (Adjusted Slope P).
- The documented patterns underpin the evaluation of century-scale forcing fields used to drive land surface and hydrological models, aiding inter-model comparisons and water-resource assessments.
- Users should be mindful of potential data limitations during pre-1958 periods (ERA-40 basis-year randomization and limited station coverage) when interpreting long-term trends.
