# Pike Growth Data 1944-1995

## Overview
- Growth (length) data for Pike (Esox lucius) from net sampling, collected from Windermere Lake, Cumbria (1944–1995).
- Dataset used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist to examine climate change effects on trait-based dynamics of a top predator in freshwater ecosystems.
- In this data set, only female pike are included.
- File is part of a set of related pike datasets and Windermere lake temperature data.

## Sampling Site and Species
- Species measured: Esox lucius (Pike)
- Site: Windermere Lake, Great Britain (North and South basins)
- Spatial detail: Nets deployed across multiple sites in both basins; sites rotated to cover the lake systematically

## Experimental Design and Sampling Regime
- Early method (pre-1982): Varied gill-netting with larger mesh; broader sampling strategy
- Standardised method (since 1982):
  - Net type: 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets
  - Net size: 40 m long x 3 m deep
  - Deployment: Set on the bottom, mid-October to late December
  - Depth: ~4–5 m
  - Sites: 10 sites per basin (north and south)
  - Schedule: Typically five nets fished at a site at a time; inspected and catches removed on a three-day cycle (Mon–Wed–Fri)
  - Coverage: Each site fished for two weeks per season; nets rotated to cover the lake
- Sampling effort:
  - 1982–1989: Additional netting during the period, total ~348 net days per year, distributed roughly equally between basins
  - Since 1990: Total annual effort ~240 net days, distributed equally between basins
- Data collected: All pike caught were killed and processed in the lab

## Analytical Methods
- In the lab, pike were assigned an IND (individual identity), measured for LENGTH (fork length to 1 mm), weighed (to 100 g), and sexed
- Age determination: Left opercular bone used; nominal birth date of 1 April (Frost & Kipling, 1959)
- Quality control: Measurements checked via permutations of three individuals

## Practical Notes for Analysts
- The dataset provides longitudinal length measurements for individual female pike, enabling analyses of growth trajectories over time in a warming freshwater lake context.
- Can be combined with related datasets (fecundity, survival, lake temperature) to explore links between growth, environmental conditions, and population dynamics.
- Suitable for assessments of environmental health indicators and policy-performance related to climate impacts on top freshwater predators.
