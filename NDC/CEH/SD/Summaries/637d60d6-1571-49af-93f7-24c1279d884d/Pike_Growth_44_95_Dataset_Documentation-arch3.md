# Pike Growth Data 1944-1995

- Dataset of growth (length) data on Pike (Esox lucius) from net sampling.
- Timeframe: data collection began in 1944; data span in this file: 1944-1995.
- Source lineage: initially collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); since 1989 collected by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
- Scope note: this dataset includes only female pike.

## Sampling Design and Field Methods

- Location within Windermere Lake: North and South basins; pike monitored by gill netting.
- Sampling regime (standardised since 1982):
  - Nets: 64 mm bar mesh, multifilament gill nets.
  - Net size: 40 m length × 3 m depth; typically five nets deployed at a time.
  - Sites: 10 sites per basin (north and south), with rotating site coverage to achieve systematic lake-wide sampling.
  - Season: mid-October to late December; depths of about 4–5 m.
  - Scheduling: nets set on Monday, inspected and catch removed on Wednesday, lifted on Friday; site-level sampling repeated the following week; each site fished for two weeks per season.
- Sampling effort:
  - 1982–1989: total annual effort ≈ 348 net days (distributed roughly equally between basins).
  - Since 1990: total annual effort ≈ 240 net days (distributed roughly equally between basins).

## Data Collection and Measurements

- Laboratory processing:
  - Each pike assigned an individual identity (IND), measured for fork length to 1 mm (LENGTH), weighed to 100 g (WEIGHT), and sexed.
  - Age determination via left opercular bone using Frost & Kipling (1959) methodology; birth date set as 1 April.
- Quality control:
  - Measurements checked by permutations of three individuals to ensure accuracy.

## Analytical and Referencing Context

- Analytical framework and methods cited:
  - Winfield, James, & Fletcher (2008) on population size and condition in relation to prey abundance.
  - Frost & Kipling (1959) on age and growth determination from scales and opercular bones.
- This Pike Growth Data is part of a broader set used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist study on climate-change effects in trait-based dynamics of a top predator in freshwater ecosystems.

## Data Governance and Access Considerations

- Data origin and stewardship:
  - Collected by FBA, later by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
- Metadata and transparency:
  - Comprehensive accompanying metadata available (linked records above).
  - Emphasis on data standardisation and traceability through documented methods and archival metadata.
- Reuse considerations for monitoring frameworks:
  - The dataset demonstrates long-term monitoring with consistent sampling design, clear measurement protocols, and age-length relationships, useful for evaluating climatic or ecosystem changes over time.
  - Public sharing of underlying data is noted, with process details aligned to data governance and metadata standards.
