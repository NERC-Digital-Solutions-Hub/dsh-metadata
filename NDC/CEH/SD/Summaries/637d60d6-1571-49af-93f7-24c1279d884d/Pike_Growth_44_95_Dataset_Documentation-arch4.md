# Pike Growth Data 1944-1995

- Overview
  - Growth (length) data on Pike (Esox lucius) from net sampling, spanning 1944–1995.
  - Data were collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and, from 1989 onward, by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
  - In this dataset, only female pike are included.
  - Used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist to study trait-based dynamics of a top predator in freshwater ecosystems.

- Data file details
  - File: PikeGrowthData1944_1995.csv
  - Format: CSV
  - Size: 675 KB
  - Columns: YEAR (year of capture), LENGTH (length at capture in cm), IND (individual fish identity)

- Location and sampling site
  - Location: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain
  - Approximate site coordinates: OS Grid Reference SD393960; WGS84 54.360193, -2.935836
  - Species measured: Esox lucius (Pike)

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Long-running gill-net monitoring in the lake’s north and south basins.
  - Standardization since 1982: 64 mm bar-mesh multifilament gill nets, 40 m x 3 m, set on the bottom between mid-October and late December at depths of ~4–5 m.
  - Sampling pattern: five nets in the water at any time, sites rotated to cover the lake; each site fished for two weeks per season; netting conducted at two basins with roughly equal effort.
  - Annual sampling effort: ~348 net days (1982–1989) transitioning to ~240 net days since 1990, distributed equally between basins.

- Collection, laboratory processing, and aging
  - Processing: all pike killed, taken to the laboratory.
  - Measurements: fork length to 1 mm accuracy; wet weight to 100 g precision.
  - Aging: left opercular bone used to determine age, with a nominal birth date of 1 April.
  - Data recording: each fish assigned a unique ID (IND) corresponding to the individual measured.

- Data quality and validation
  - Quality control involves measurements checked by permutations of three individuals.
  - Method references cited for aging and standardization (Le Cren 2001; Winfield et al. 2008; Frost & Kipling 1959).
