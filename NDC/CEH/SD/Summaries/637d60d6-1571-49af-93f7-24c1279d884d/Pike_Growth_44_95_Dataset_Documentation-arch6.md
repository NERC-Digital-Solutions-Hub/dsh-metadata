# Pike Growth Data 1944-1995

## Overview
- Dataset of growth (length) data on Pike (Esox lucius) from net sampling.
- Data period: 1944–1995; only female pike included.
- Used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist context on climate change and trait-based dynamics in freshwater ecosystems.

## Data origin and provenance
- Initial collection by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); since 1989 collected by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
- Part of a data series with related datasets (e.g., fecundity, survival, and lake temperature data).
- Metadata and data series links provided for related datasets.

## Data format and contents
- Format: CSV (PikeGrowthData1944_1995.csv).
- Size: 675 KB.
- Columns: YEAR (year of capture), LENGTH (fork length in cm, to 1 mm precision), IND (individual fish identity number).
- Location: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain (OS Grid Reference and coordinates provided).

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Monitoring in Windermere’s north and south basins using gill netting.
- Standardization implemented since 1982:
  - Nets: 64 mm bar mesh multifilament, 40 m x 3 m.
  - Deployment: bottom-setting, Oct–Dec, ~4–5 m depth, 10 sites per basin.
  - Sampling cadence: five nets per site, sites fished for two weeks per season; weekly rotation.
- Annual sampling effort:
  - 1982–1989: ~348 net days total, distributed between basins.
  - Since 1990: ~240 net days total, distributed between basins.

## Collection methods and laboratory work
- Post-capture processing of all pike in labs.
- Measurements:
  - LENGTH: fork length to 1 mm.
  - WEIGHT: wet weight to 100 g.
  - Sex determined; left opercular bone aged with birth date of 1 April (aging method described by Frost & Kipling, 1959).

## Quality control and data handling
- Quality checks involve permutations across three individuals to verify measurements (quality control protocol).
- Ageing method references:
  - Frost & Kipling (1959) for aging from scales and opercular bones.
  - Validation and growth analyses linked to Winfield et al. (2008); broader methodological citations provided.

## Data usage and considerations
- Data suitable for growth analyses, age structure, and long-term trend studies in relation to environmental variables (e.g., temperature data from Windermere).
- Important notes:
  - Data cover only females.
  - Methodological notes emphasize standardization from 1982 onward; historical sampling methods varied prior to 1982.
  - Geolocation limited to Windermere Lake with precise references provided for reproducibility.
- Potential for integration with related datasets (fecundity, survival, temperature) for multi-trait, multi-variable analyses.
