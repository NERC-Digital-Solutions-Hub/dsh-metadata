# Effects of Scale in Organic Agriculture, 2006-2010

- Purpose and scope
  - Conduct an integrated assessment of the hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of land management using organic farming as a case study.
  - Explore effects across multiple scales—from field to landscape to national—and how these scale-dependent effects influence environmental health and rural communities.

- Research questions
  - What influences the spatial concentration of organic farms at various scales?
  - What are the scale-dependent ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural impacts of different farm concentrations?

- Context and rationale
  - Growing conversion from conventional to organic farming due to biodiversity loss, water use, and agro-chemical run-off.
  - Farm outcomes depend on landscape context; organic benefits may be amplified or dampened by surrounding land use and network dynamics.

- Study design and scales
  - Matched-pair approach: organic and conventional farms paired within landscapes that vary greatly in organic land share.
  - Scales examined from field level up to watershed and regional levels, incorporating interactions across biophysical and social landscapes.

- Variables and domains studied
  - Ecological: bird, invertebrate, and plant biodiversity; soil physical properties; soil tillage energy; water infiltration rates; runoff and nutrient transfer to downstream waters.
  - Hydrological: infiltration, hydrological responses at watershed scale.
  - Socio-economic: farm economic flows, value added, on-farm resource use, marketing and supply chain coordination.
  - Cultural: cross-farm social interactions, farm family attitudes, perceptions of organic farming.

- Data and methods
  - Mixed methods: quantitative field surveys, soil and water measurements, biodiversity assessments, and qualitative interviews.
  - Modelling and scenario analysis to project future development and landscape-level impacts.
  - Participatory approaches (workshops) to incorporate stakeholder perspectives and co-construct scenarios.

- Key concepts and findings (ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural)
  - Biodiversity and landscape context
    - Biodiversity benefits are enhanced where organic farming concentrates within landscapes (hotspots), but benefits depend on surrounding land use and connectivity.
  - Hydrology and soil
    - Organic management, especially in grasslands, improves soil water infiltration and can reduce flood risk; effects scale with landscape pattern rather than just farm-level practices.
  - Market, networks, and social dynamics
    - Local networks can lower transaction costs and accelerate diffusion of organic farming; however, high local concentration can also create competition and affect profitability.
  - Social and cultural dimensions
    - Clustering influences local markets, information exchange, and social capital; changing perceptions and legitimacy of organic farming emerge through community dynamics and historical stigma.

- Implications for monitoring, policy, and governance
  - Emphasizes linking datasets across scales to evaluate environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Supports landscape-wide, cooperative approaches to biodiversity and hydrological benefits; policy instruments should encourage farmer cooperation and habitat networks.
  - Targeted expansion of organic farming in hotspot areas could maximize ecological and hydrological gains, while recognizing unequal benefits across species and landscapes.
  - Monitoring should integrate ecological, hydrological, economic, and socio-cultural data to inform scale-appropriate governance and market development.

- Outputs, data, and accessibility
  - Production of maps classifying land by organic farming intensity (hotspots vs. coldspots) and integrated multi-scale analyses.
  - Datasets prepared for storage and upload to relevant portals to enable broader access and scrutiny.
  - Outputs intended to support standardized monitoring of environmental health and policy performance across scales.

- Next steps and ongoing work
  - Continued integration of ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural data into standardized datasets and outputs.
  - Development of maps and portal-ready datasets to support monitoring and policy assessment across scales.
  - Further analysis of scale-dependent effects to inform policy design, market development, and land-management programs.

- Context and approach
  - Systems perspective: identifies essential sub-systems (e.g., watershed, landscape) and their mutual relationships, with change viewed as a co-adaptive process.
  - Combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques, modelling, and participatory processes to construct and evaluate future development scenarios for the organic sector.
  - Nine integrated work packages structure field surveys, social interviews, and scenario analysis to assess multi-dimensional impacts.
