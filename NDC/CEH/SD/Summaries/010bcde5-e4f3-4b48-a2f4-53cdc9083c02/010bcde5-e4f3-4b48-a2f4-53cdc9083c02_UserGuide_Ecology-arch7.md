# RURAL ECONOMY AND LAND USE

- Intensive agriculture drives costs and environmental concerns such as biodiversity loss, high water usage, and agro-chemical runoff; significant UK farmland is converting to organic farming and other uses.
- The project aims to conduct an integrated assessment of hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of land management changes, using organic farming as a case study.
- Scales of interest range from field to landscape to national; impacts are investigated using matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in landscapes with contrasting levels of organic cultivation.

## Aims and scope

- Two core questions:
  - What influences the spatial concentration of organic farms at multiple scales?
  - How do scale-dependent ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural impacts vary with different patterns of organic farming?
- Emphasizes that farm outcomes depend on their landscape context and interactions with surrounding land-use patterns.

## Scales, context, and landscape effects

- Farms cannot be treated in isolation; surrounding conventional farming can indirectly protect organic farms, while isolated organic fragments may fail to sustain biodiversity.
- Biodiversity, hydrology, and socio-economic outcomes depend on landscape context, not just farm-level practices.
- Resource and market considerations (e.g., local networks, processing/marketing) influence adoption and persistence of organic farming.
- Change is framed as a co-adaptive process among interacting sub-systems (watershed, landscape, farms, networks) within a common environment.

## Streams of study and methods

- Integrated, systems-based approach combining qualitative and quantitative techniques with modeling.
- Nine integrated work packages; field surveys of fauna, flora, water flows, soil quality, plus structured and open interviews within focal neighbourhoods and the broader organic-food chain.
- Mixed methods used to construct and evaluate scenarios for future development of the organic sector across local, regional, and national scales.

## Matched-pairs design and data layers

- Matched organic and conventional farms chosen within landscapes that differ greatly in organic land fraction.
- Within landscapes, focal farms are selected to be comparable in soils, landforms, and crops grown; sampling includes on-farm and surrounding context.
- Data collected across multiple dimensions to support GIS analyses:
  - Biodiversity (birds, invertebrates, plants)
  - Soil properties and hydrology (soil workability, tillage energy, infiltration rates)
  - Water run-off and downstream nutrient transfer
  - Farm economics, value added, resource use
  - Marketing, supply chains, cross-farm interactions
  - Farm family cultural attitudes and social networks

## Practical GIS considerations and data integration

- Spatial visualization and analysis emphasize scale-dependent patterns across nested levels (field, landscape, regional, national).
- Critical GIS challenges include data dispersed across multiple sources, gaps at suitable resolutions, inconsistent standards, and large, complex datasets needing packaging into usable formats.
- Data integration targets multiple layers such as:
  - Spatial distribution of organic farming and hotspots
  - Soil types and proximity/relationships (e.g., within landscape units)
  - Farm types (e.g., dairy, mixed)
  - Field selections (e.g., three winter cereal fields and three permanent pastures per farm)
- The study advocates aligning data resolutions with the ecological and hydrological processes of interest (e.g., watershed and landscape scales) and thorough documentation of provenance, units, and classifications.

## Fieldwork and sampling design

- Site selection uses paired landscapes with contrasting organic fractions (high vs low).
- Criteria for paired farms include farm type (dairy or mixed), comparable livestock and crops, farm size, and soil considerations.
- On-site data collection emphasizes multiple representative fields per farm to capture variability.

## Key findings guiding GIS visualization

- Biodiversity benefits are linked to higher local concentrations of organic farming and to habitat-network configurations; aggregated networks can enhance many species, though some may require alternative arrangements.
- Grassland management and organic practices can improve soil infiltration and reduce flood risk; benefits extend to both organic and, to some extent, conventional grassland management.
- Economic and spatial dynamics show that less productive areas may be first to convert if policy or markets incentivize, but many marginal farms may already be near-bio environment equilibrium.
- Local producer networks can reduce transaction costs and strengthen social capital, aiding diffusion of organic farming; however, high local concentration can also intensify competition in local markets.

## Implications for policy, practice, and data products

- Integrated farm- and landscape-scale analyses help identify where organic farming yields the greatest ecological, hydrological, and socio-economic benefits.
- Policy and market structures should support producer networks, local processing, and marketing to reduce barriers to larger organic clusters.
- Social capital and local networks are critical to adoption and success of organic farming at scale.
- GIS outputs should inform policymakers, farmers, and the public by illustrating how scale and landscape context shape outcomes.

## Practical GIS and data-packaging notes for end-users

- Align data resolutions with relevant processes (field to watershed to landscape).
- Thoroughly document data provenance, units, and classification schemes to address standardization.
- Package multi-layer outputs for end-user exploration, including layers such as hotspots, land cover, soil types, farm types, and proximity metrics.
- Emphasize visualization of scale-dependent patterns to support policy development and farming networks.

## Summary of core GIS guidance for the project

- Scale matters: biodiversity, hydrological, and socio-economic outcomes depend on the spatial concentration of organic farming and the scale of analysis.
- Visualization of hotspots and coldspots within appropriate landscape units provides actionable insights for biodiversity and hydrology planning.
- Matched-landscape field research enables robust assessment of scale effects across ecological, hydrological, economic, and sociocultural dimensions.
- Integrating farm-level data with landscape-level patterns supports data products that help policymakers, farmers, and the public understand organic farming dynamics across multiple scales.
