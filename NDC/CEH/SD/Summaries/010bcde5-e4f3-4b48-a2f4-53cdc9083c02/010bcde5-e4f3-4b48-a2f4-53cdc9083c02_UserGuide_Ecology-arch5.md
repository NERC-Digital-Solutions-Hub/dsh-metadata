# Effects of Scale in Organic Agriculture, 2006-2010 Ecological data USER GUIDE

## Overview
- Investigates how the concentration of organic farming across landscapes affects ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural outcomes at multiple scales (field to national).
- Aims to understand what drives the spatial concentration of organic farms and how scale-dependent effects influence environmental and social outcomes.
- Uses an integrated, systems approach with matched pairs of organic and conventional farms within landscapes varying in organic land fractions.
- Emphasizes that farm outcomes cannot be isolated from their landscape context; scale of uptake and assessment critically shapes observed effects.

## Data scope and harmonization
- Integrates multi-disciplinary data (ecology, hydrology, economics, sociology) across consistent spatial scales (notably 10x10 km grid cells) to enable reproducible cross-study comparisons.
- Defines clear classifications for hotspot/coldspot mappings, grid boundaries, and thresholds (e.g., >10% organic land).

## Provenance and metadata
- Documents site selection criteria (paired landscapes, matched farms), data collection protocols, and field sampling schemes (e.g., three cereal fields and three pastures per farm).
- Records data sources, collection years (2006–2010), and any data transformations (quality assurance, cleaning, reformatting).

## Geospatial data management
- Stores and shares geospatial layers (grid classifications, farm locations, land-use patterns) with comprehensive spatial metadata (projection, resolution, grid size).
- Addresses privacy and sensitivity of farm-level locations; promotes aggregation or anonymization where necessary.

## Data sharing and discoverability
- Prepares datasets for portals and catalogue nodes with standardized metadata, data dictionaries, and category schemas (e.g., biodiversity metrics, soil infiltration rates, land-use change).
- Includes versioning and change history to support updates and long-term reuse.

## Data quality, interoperability, and standards
- Implements uniform QA/QC procedures across datasets.
- Aligns dataset schemas with interoperability standards to enable integration with other organic farming and land-use research.

## Documentation of limitations and context
- Articulates limitations of hotspot/coldspot mapping (time-bound data, grid-scale effects, potential misclassification).
- Provides interpretation guidelines for policymakers, land managers, and researchers.

## Practical implications for data sharing and discovery
- Facilitates use by researchers and policymakers interested in scale effects of organic farming.
- Provides reproducible workflows (grid definitions, thresholds, matched-farm design) to derive hotspot analyses.
- Establishes access controls and licensing that balance open data goals with confidentiality considerations for farm locations.

## Challenges and considerations for Data Stewards
- Incomplete articulation of user needs across scales; challenges in aligning priorities.
- Timeliness and completeness of data transfer from farms and landscapes.
- Achieving consistent metadata and standards across diverse systems and formats.
- Managing large, multi-faceted datasets with spatial components.
- Handling legacy or non-interoperable data sources.
- Balancing spatial data granularity with privacy concerns at farm level.

## Recommendations and next steps
- Apply integrated, scale-aware analyses to guide policy and farm-level decisions on biodiversity and flood risk mitigation.
- Foster collaboration among hotspot-area farmers to maximize ecological benefits while addressing species-specific needs.
- Promote documentation and open sharing of standardized datasets to enable replication and wider use beyond the project.
- Continuously monitor and update datasets to reflect changes in organic farming concentration and associated ecological/hydrological impacts.

## Context and team
- Part of a broader research program examining hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of land management, using organic farming as a case study.
- Employs field surveys, social surveys, modelling, and participatory approaches across nine integrated work packages.
- Team associated with the RELU SCALE project (University of Sussex) and related collaborators.
