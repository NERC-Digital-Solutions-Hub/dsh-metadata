# RURAL ECONOMY AND LAND USE

- Purpose and scope
  - Conduct an integrated assessment of hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of land management using organic farming as a case study.
  - Examine scales from field to landscape to national, using matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in landscapes with contrasting levels of organic cultivation.

- Data and evidence across domains
  - Ecological and biophysical: biodiversity (bird, invertebrate, plant), soil physical properties, soil tillage energy, water infiltration, runoff, erosion, nutrient transfer to downstream waters.
  - Economic and social: farm economics and value added, on-farm resource use, marketing and supply chain coordination, cross-farm social interactions, farm family attitudes.
  - Governance and networks: investigations into whether there is a critical mass to establish alternative supply networks and how local networks affect purchasing, processing, and distribution.

- Study design and methods
  - Nested spatial scales: field, farm, landscape, with landscapes differing in organic cultivation fractions.
  - Analyses include empirical studies, modelling, social surveys, interviews (structured and open), and participatory approaches.
  - Nine integrated work packages coordinating field surveys, hydrological/biophysical measurements, economic and social analyses, and scenario evaluation.
  - Emphasis on a systems approach and co-adaptive dynamics among subsystems (watershed, landscape, farms, networks).

- Outputs and implications
  - Development of scenarios for the future development of the organic sector at local, regional, and national levels.
  - Informing policy and practice on how scale and context influence the benefits and costs of organic farming.
  - Exploration of how changes in management, market structures, and social networks affect adoption and diffusion of organic practices.

- Data leadership takeaways for Data Leaders
  - Build a holistic, multi-domain data system that links hydrology, biodiversity, soil health, and socio-economic indicators across multiple scales.
  - Foster co-ownership of data products with policymakers, farmers, and industry stakeholders to ensure relevance and adoption.
  - Prioritize spatially explicit datasets and scalable metrics that capture landscape-scale effects (field to national).
  - Develop and enforce data standards and metadata practices to enable cross-domain and cross-scale analyses (including open data where possible).
  - Promote integrated data sharing and collaboration across sectors to translate complex, systems-based findings into policy-relevant insights.
  - Support iterative, participatory data governance processes that include stakeholder workshops and scenario planning.

- Challenges and considerations for data leaders
  - Fragmented data across domains and scales requiring careful integration.
  - Balancing granularity with national-level applicability; ensuring comparability across landscapes.
  - Data privacy, protection, and access barriers when linking farm-level and market data.
  - Aligning multiple stakeholders’ priorities to avoid duplication and ensure coordinated efforts.

- Conclusion
  - The SCALE-inspired approach demonstrates how scale-aware, integrated data strategies can illuminate how organic farming impacts biodiversity, hydrology, economics, and social dynamics, informing more effective policy and practice across local to national levels.
