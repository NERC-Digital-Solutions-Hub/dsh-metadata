# Effects of Scale in Organic Agriculture, 2006-2010 Ecological data USER GUIDE

## Context and Motivation
- It is unclear whether benefits of organic farming are greatest at the farm scale or at larger landscape scales (across several farms).
- Hydrological effects depend on watershed-scale cultivation patterns; landscape context may also influence socio-economic aspects.
- Isolation and lack of access to networks can hinder transitions and diffusion of organic farming; local concentrations may also reduce profits due to competition.
- Biodiversity, water use, and agro-chemical run-off are central concerns driving shifts from conventional to organic farming.

## The Research Questions
- What influences the spatial concentration of organic farms across multiple scales?
- How do ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural impacts vary with the scale and extent of organic farming in surrounding landscapes?

## The Research Approach
- Integrated, multi-scale assessment encompassing field to landscape to national scales.
- Uses matched pairs of organic and conventional farms within landscapes that vary widely in organic land cover.
- Aims to understand context: farms cannot be studied in isolation from their surroundings; neighboring practices influence pests, disease, and biodiversity benefits.
- Seeks to identify drivers of spatial density of land management practices and whether landscapes become predominantly organic or conventional.

## Scales and Sub-systems
- Scales examined: from field to landscape to national, with nested analyses across biophysical and social dimensions.
- Essential sub-systems include watershed hydrology, landscape structure, farm operations, and social networks; change is viewed as a co-adaptive process among these sub-systems.

## Methods and Data
- Mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative techniques.
- Field surveys of biodiversity, soil properties, water infiltration, and hydrological flows.
- Social data collected via structured and open interviews within focal neighbourhoods and the broader organic supply chain.
- nine integrated work packages guiding the project; scenario development to explore future sector growth under different spatial concentrations.

## Key Concepts for Monitoring and Evaluation
- Landscape context matters: biodiversity and ecosystem services depend on surrounding land-use patterns, not just on individual farms.
- Hydrological outcomes require watershed-scale assessment rather than sole farm-level analyses.
- Social and economic dynamics: local producer networks can reduce transaction costs and support diffusion, but high local concentration can intensify competition and affect profits.
- A systems approach is essential to understand interdependencies and feedbacks across scales.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- Develop scale-aware indicators that capture ecological, hydrological, economic, and cultural dimensions across field, landscape, and national levels.
- Incorporate data on spatial concentration, diffusion networks, and market access to assess diffusion and scalability of organic farming.
- Use nested, multi-scale data collection and scenario planning to inform policy and future monitoring efforts.
- Emphasize collaboration across disciplines and stakeholder engagement to identify drivers and context-specific responses.
