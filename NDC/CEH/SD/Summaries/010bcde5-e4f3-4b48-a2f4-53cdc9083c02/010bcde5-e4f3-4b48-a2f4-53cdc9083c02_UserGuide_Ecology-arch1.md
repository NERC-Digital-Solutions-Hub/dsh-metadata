# RURAL ECONOMY AND LAND USE

## Overview
- Integrated assessment of hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of land management using organic farming as a case study.
- Aims to understand how uptake of organic farming influences rural environments and communities across multiple scales—from field to landscape to national.

## Key questions
- What influences the spatial concentration of organic farms at various scales?
- How do scale-dependent concentrations of organic farming affect ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural outcomes?

## Context and rationale
- Intensive agriculture is costly; biodiversity loss and water/chemical run-off have economic and environmental costs.
- Shifts from conventional to organic farming are happening; impacts depend on the scale of uptake and the scale of assessment.
- Farms cannot be studied in isolation from their surroundings; biodiversity and socio-economic effects depend on landscape context, including interactions with nearby conventional farms and potential isolation risks.
- Landscape-scale considerations may modify hydrological and socio-economic outcomes (e.g., watershed-level infiltration, run-off, and market networks).
- Local networks can support investment, processing, and marketing, potentially reducing costs and speeding diffusion of organic farming; however, high local concentration can also intensify local market competition.

## Study design and methods
- Use of matched pairs: organic and conventional farms within landscapes that vary in the fraction of land under organic cultivation.
- Analyses span nested scales: field, farm, landscape, and broader biophysical and social landscapes; complemented by social surveys.
- Within landscapes, focus on focal organic and conventional growers with similar soils, landforms, and crops.

## What will be studied
- Environmental outcomes: biodiversity (birds, invertebrates, plants), soil physical properties, tillage energy, and soil hydrology (infiltration, run-off, erosion, nutrient transfer to downstream waters).
- Economic and socio-cultural outcomes: farm economic flows, value added, on-farm resource use, marketing and supply chains, cross-farm social interactions, and farm-family cultural attitudes.
- Social networks and governance: potential necessary critical mass for alternative supply networks and how networks influence adoption and diffusion.

## Contextual factors and mechanisms
- The spatial density of organic practices is driven by drivers that determine whether landscapes become organic- or conventional-dominated.
- Biodiversity gains may require spatio-temporal management variation across landscapes; benefits may be limited if organic land is too fragmented or isolated.
- Surrounding conventional farming can offer indirect protection, while concentrated organic clusters may invite competition for local markets.

## Data, integration, and challenges for analysts
- System-wide approach requires integrating field data, biophysical measurements, and social data across multiple scales.
- Data availability at local scales can be fragmented; datasets may be known mainly within niche or academic circles.
- Handling heterogeneity in data formats and quality, plus IT barriers and computational demands, poses challenges.
- Aims for reproducibility and transparency through documenting data provenance and incorporating stakeholder input.

## Implications and next steps
- Identify drivers of spatial density and how scale affects ecological, hydrological, economic, and cultural outcomes.
- Explore whether a critical mass of producers is needed to establish effective supply networks and how to support diffusion through policy and networks.
- Inform agri-environment schemes and regional planning with scenario analyses and stakeholder engagement.
- Improve data collection, curation, and dissemination (with metadata) to enable cross-study synthesis and long-term monitoring.

## Notable approach and perspective
- The project uses a systems approach, emphasizing interactions among sub-systems (e.g., watershed, landscape) and co-adaptive dynamics over time.
- Combines qualitative and quantitative methods with modelling and participatory workshops to understand future development and to evaluate different spatial concentrations of organic farming.

## Project context and outputs
- Based at University of Sussex; RELU SCALE project; field surveys, interviews, and integrated analyses across local to national case studies.
- Produces policy-relevant insights for biodiversity, hydrology, economics, and social cohesion in farming communities.
