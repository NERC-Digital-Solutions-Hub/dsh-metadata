# RURAL ECONOMY AND LAND USE

- Aim and scope
  - Conduct an integrated assessment of the hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of land management using organic farming as a case study.
  - Explore scales from field to landscape to national, using matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in landscapes with contrasting levels of organic cultivation.
  - Treat farms as part of larger systems where context (neighbouring practices, networks, markets) matters for outcomes.

- Core research questions
  - What influences the spatial concentration of organic farms across multiple scales?
  - What are the scale-dependent ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural impacts of different patterns of organic farming?

- Context and rationale
  - Intensive agriculture carries biodiversity loss, high water use, and agro-chemical runoff costs.
  - Shifts toward organic farming are influenced by scale of uptake and the scale at which effects are assessed.
  - Farm viability and biodiversity benefits depend on landscape context, connectivity, and social networks (e.g., advice networks, markets, and supply chains).
  - Local concentrations can create both benefits (biodiversity, social capital) and drawbacks (market competition, reduced profits).

- Scale and approach
  - Nested spatial analysis spanning field, landscape, and national levels.
  - Use of matched organic and conventional farms within landscapes that vary in organic land fraction.
  - Examination of interactions among biophysical (biodiversity, soil, hydrology) and social (economic flows, marketing, social networks, cultural attitudes) dimensions.
  - Systems-based, co-adaptive perspective: sub-systems (water, habitat, farms, networks) influence each other, with viability depending on the health of each sub-system.

- Methods and work structure
  - Nine integrated work packages combining qualitative and quantitative methods with modelling.
  - Field surveys of fauna, flora, water flows, and soil quality.
  - Structured and open interviews within focal neighborhoods and the wider organic food chain.
  - Scenario analysis for future development of the organic sector across local, regional, and national scales.
  - Participatory workshops to support iterative learning among natural and social scientists and stakeholders.

- Data and data management (Data Support perspective)
  - Data types span ecological, hydrological, soil, economic, and sociocultural domains.
  - Challenges include integrating heterogeneous data, patchy data availability, and multiple data systems across scales.
  - Emphasis on combining qualitative and quantitative data and on developing data products (e.g., maps, dashboards) to enable self-service analysis and broader dissemination.
  - Data quality assurance and standardization across sub-systems are critical for linking field results to landscape and national analyses.

- Outputs and dissemination
  - Integrated analyses and modelling results to inform policy and practice.
  - Data products and dashboards designed to illustrate spatial patterns, scale effects, and scenario outcomes.
  - Stakeholder engagement through workshops and surveys to co-create knowledge and assess the sensitivity of results to neighborhood context.

- Implications for policy and practice
  - Evidence on how biodiversity, hydrology, and socio-economic factors respond to different spatial concentrations of organic farming.
  - Insight into the potential benefits of local networks, supply chains, and critical-mass effects for accelerating organic adoption.
  - Guidance on where scale-focused policies and support networks may be most effective to promote sustainable farming and reduce environmental costs.

- Key findings to anticipate (from the project framing)
  - The viability and biodiversity benefits of organic farming are context-dependent, with landscape-scale considerations shaping outcomes.
  - A necessary critical mass may be required to establish effective alternative markets and processing networks.
  - Local concentrations may both support and undermine farmer profits, highlighting the need for balanced regional planning and collaboration.

- Timeline and collaboration
  - Work organized across integrated work packages with data collection, analysis, and scenario development continuing from field-scale studies to wider landscape applications.
  - Project integrates ecological, hydrological, economic, and social science perspectives to inform multi-level decision-making.
