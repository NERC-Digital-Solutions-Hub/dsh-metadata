# Abstract: Microsatellite data for five species of common and declining bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum, B. hortorum and B. ruderatus ) collected across the Hillesden Estate, Buckinghamshire, UK, in summer 2011

- Purpose and scope
  - Genetic data collected from five bumblebee species to study population structure across an agricultural landscape.
  - Worker genotypes determined from sampled individuals; queen genotypes reconstructed from worker offspring.
  - Part of a project led by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, funded under the Insect Pollinators Initiative.

- Data quality and validation
  - Non-lethal sampling of worker DNA; standardized protocols used.
  - Genotyping and colony assignment performed with COLONY v2.0; genotyping error rate estimated at 0–5% from re-genotyping 10% of samples.
  - Data checked for errors by CEH and Institute of Zoology staff.
  - Analyses based on the data have been peer-reviewed and published in Molecular Ecology.

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Study area: 1,950 ha landscape around Hillesden Estate, Buckinghamshire, UK.
  - Sampling grid: 250 x 250 m cells; habitat patches within cells screened for potential nesting/foraging sites.
  - Sampling period: 4–5 days per week from 20 June to 5 August 2011.
  - Mitigation context: Standardised agri-environment options (grass and wildflower margins) implemented since 2005.

- Collection, generation and transformation methods
  - Non-lethal DNA collection from the terminal tarsus; samples preserved in 100% ethanol.
  - Microsatellite genotyping: 10–14 loci per species; PCR products sized via capillary electrophoresis.
  - Species-specific loci listed; overall 2,577 workers genotyped across five species.
  - Queen genotypes reconstructed from worker genotypes using COLONY v2.0.

- Data structure, units and recording
  - Data stored as CSV files; raw worker genotypes and queen reconstructed genotypes.
  - Columns include sample identifiers, collection date, colony/taxon details, and allele data for each microsatellite locus.
  - Worker data include whether a sample contributed to reduced diversity analyses; queen data include colony, family size, and queen IDs.
  - Species codes: bter (Bombus terrestris), blap (B. lapidarius), bpas (B. pascuorum), bhor (B. hortorum), brud (B. ruderatus).

- Data files and accessibility
  - Data entered in Excel and submitted to EIDC as CSV files.
  - Worker genotypes and queen genotypes provided per species:
    - Worker genotypes: five CSV files
      - Dreier etal_IPI_Bombus_microsatellite_bter_worker genotypes.csv, etc.
    - Queen reconstructed genotypes: five CSV files
      - Dreier etal_IPI_Bombus_microsatellite_bter_queen genotypes.csv, etc.
  - Metadata fields cover collection, colony, and locus information; missing data indicated as "0".

- Methods and references
  - Standard microsatellite methods referenced (Estoup et al. 1995, 1996; Reber Funk et al. 2006; Stolle et al. 2009; Truett et al. 2000; Wang 2004).
  - Lab protocols include HotSHOT DNA extraction, PCR conditions, and capillary electrophoresis with specific locus panels per species.

- Relevance to monitoring and governance
  - Demonstrates a robust, quality-controlled workflow for generating genetic monitoring data across landscapes.
  - Emphasizes data quality assurance, transparent metadata, and public data sharing through a centralized repository (EIDC).
  - Framework supports long-term monitoring of pollinator populations and evaluation of landscape and management effects on genetic diversity and colony structure.
