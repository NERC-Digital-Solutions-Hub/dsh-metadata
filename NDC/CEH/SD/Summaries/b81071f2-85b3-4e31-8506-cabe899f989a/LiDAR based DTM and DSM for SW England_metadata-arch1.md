# LiDAR based digital terrain and surface model for SW England [TELLUS SW-Project]

- Overview: British Antarctic Survey (BAS) collected a high-resolution LiDAR dataset over Cornwall and Devon in July–August 2013 for the Tellus South West project; Environment Agency contracted the processing to produce digital terrain (DTM) and surface (DSM) models.
- Dataset details:
  - Two height layers: DTM (bare-earth terrain) and DSM (bare-earth plus features like buildings/vegetation)
  - Spatial resolution: 1 m grid cells
  - Height accuracy: ~25 cm
  - Coverage area: 9,424 km² west of Exmouth (approximately west of 3°21′W)
  - Data format: ESRI grid tiles (e.g., SX37ne, SX37nw, SX37se, SX37sw)
  - Coordinate system: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG:27700)
- Data attributes:
  - Elevation (Height) in metres
- Experimental design:
  - 26 survey flights
  - 14,817 line km of new LiDAR data
  - Coverage: 9,424 km² with ~300 m swath overlap
  - Target specifications: 25 cm vertical accuracy; 1 point per m² data density
- Collection methods:
  - Sensor: Optech ALTM 3100 EA scanning laser
  - Positioning: Integrated Applanix GPS/INS
  - Platform: BAS Twin Otter aircraft (VP-FBL)
- Calibration and data products:
  - Used layers: Raw range files, post-processed SBET, SMRSMG accuracy files, calibration files, flight logs, ground truth survey details
  - Output: Calibrated LAS point cloud delivered as individual flight lines
  - Processing: Environment Agency Geomatics with Terrascan to generate DSM and DTM
- Quality control:
  - DSM and DTM validated against existing LiDAR and GPS ground truth data
  - EA QC report documenting accuracy and limitations
