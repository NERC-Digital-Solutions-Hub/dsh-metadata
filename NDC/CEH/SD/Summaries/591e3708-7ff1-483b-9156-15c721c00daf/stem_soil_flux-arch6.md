# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

- Context: Study conducted within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) area at KM41 reserve, near Manaus, Brazil. Soils are clay-rich Ferrasols; annual rainfall ~1900–2500 mm with a pronounced dry season (Jun–Oct). Above-ground biomass averaging 322 ± 54 Mg ha⁻¹ (≥10 cm DBH) and mean wood density ~0.67 g cm⁻³; species richness ~280 species per hectare (≥10 cm DBH).

- Objective for data work: Collect, organize, and document multi-variable data from a factorial fertilization experiment to enable analysis of how nutrient additions affect forest carbon flux and related processes, and to support data use across topics.

- Study area specifics: AFEX is a full factorial fertilization experiment with defined plot layout, fertilization schemes, and repeated measurements to enable self-serve data exploration and cross-dataset analyses.

- AFEX experimental design
  - Full factorial design with eight treatments and four replicates per treatment (32 plots total).
  - Four independent blocks, each ≥200 m apart.
  - Plots sized 50 x 50 m; all plots placed in areas with similar soil, vegetation, and topography.
  - Fertilization regime (annual, split into three applications):
    - 125 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ N as urea
    - 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ P as triple superphosphate
    - 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ of cations as potassium chloride (KCl)
    - 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ of Ca and 20 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ of Mg supplied as dolomitic limestone
  - Treatments:
    - Control
    - N
    - P
    - Cations
    - N + P
    - N + Cations
    - P + Cations
    - N + P + Cations

- Data collection methods
  - Stem respiration (CO2 efflux)
    - 320 trees total (10 per plot; DBH > 25 cm)
    - Date: October 2019
    - Instrument: Infrared gas analyser (EGM-4, PP Systems)
    - Method: Chamber placed on collar; CO2 accumulation measured for 2 minutes
  - Soil respiration
    - Autotrophic and heterotrophic components measured with Li-Cor Li-8100A
    - Chamber diameter/area: 20 cm
    - Observation length: 1 min 30 s; pre-/post-purge of 10 s
  - Collar configurations to partition respiration
    - Short collar (10 cm depth): captures total soil respiration components
    - Long collar (25 cm depth) with no windows: excludes roots and mycorrhizae
    - Deep-with-windows collar (25 cm) previously used until mid-2018; roots started to ingress later
    - Difference between 25 cm and surface-only collars used to estimate rhizosphere respiration
  - Measurement timeline
    - 2017: June–July, September, October, November
    - 2018: monthly through September
    - 2019: January, February, April, July, October

  - Data deposition: Spreadsheets deposited in the EIDC system; structured to enable cross-dataset analysis
  - Stem CO2 efflux dataset (Figure 4)
    - Columns and meanings (examples)
      - A = TAG (tree numeric identifier)
      - B = POM (point-of-measurement mark)
      - C = Block (experimental block: B1–B4)
      - D = Plot (plot identifier: P1–P8)
      - E = DBH (diameter at breast height)
      - F = Inicial_CO2 (CO2 efflux at start of measurement)
      - G = Final_CO2 (CO2 efflux at end of measurement)
      - H = PlotID (combination of block and plot)
      - I = Date (date of measurement)
      - J = additional PlotID-like field
    - Example values show per-tree records with date 24/10/2019

      - Census (campaign number)
      - File.Name (project/file identifier; e.g., AFEX)
      - Date (YYYYMMDD or equivalent)
      - Block (B1–B4)
      - Plot (P1–P8)
      - Group (collars group)

    - Collar Type details:
      - T: shallow surface collars (all flux components)
      - M: deep collars with side window (allowed mycorrhizal ingrowth; excluded after 2018 due to root ingress)
      - S: deep collars without windows (exclude root and mycorrhizae)
  - Data documentation
    - Clear column definitions and units
    - Dates and PlotIDs standardized to enable data joins across stem and soil datasets
    - Spreadsheet examples illustrate typical entries and formatting
  - Focus for data use
    - Enables cross-reference of tree-level respiration with plot-level fertilization treatments
    - Supports decomposition of soil respiration into autotrophic, heterotrophic, and rhizosphere components
    - Facilitates time-series analysis across multi-year collection windows (2017–2019)

- Data use opportunities (Data Support perspective)
  - Provide self-serve access to the AFEX data by linking stem and soil CO2 efflux measurements to the fertilization treatments and plot metadata.
  - Enable comparative analyses across treatments, blocks, and time points to assess nutrient addition effects on forest carbon flux.
  - Support data quality checks by leveraging the explicit column definitions, measurement protocols, and deposition in a centralized system (EIDC).
  - Facilitate creation of dashboards or reports that summarize respiration fluxes by treatment, collar type, and collection date, with clear unit definitions.
