# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Windermere North Basin, UK, 2019 - 2020

## Overview
- Ongoing fortnightly monitoring dataset from the Windermere North Basin (Cumbria, England) covering Jan 2019 to end of 2020.
- Parameters collected: surface temperature, surface oxygen saturation, Secchi depth, alkalinity, pH, ammonium, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphate, total phosphorus, dissolved reactive silicon, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a.
- Data are provided for download with specific units and detection-limit indicators.

## Data Collected
- Surface temperature (TEMP): °C
- Surface oxygen saturation (OXYG): % air-saturation
- Secchi depth (SECC): metres
- Alkalinity (ALKA): µg per litre as CaCO3
- pH (pH): unitless
- Ammonium (NH4N): µg per litre
- Nitrate (NO3N): µg per litre
- Soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P): µg per litre
- Total phosphorus (TOTP): µg per litre
- Dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2): µg per litre
- Phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA): µg per litre

## Sampling Regime and Location
- Fortnightly sampling regime.
- Water samples integrated from 0 to 7 m depth.
- Collected from a boat at the buoy location: Latitude 54.397, Longitude -2.952, deepest part of Windermere.

## Data Quality and Metadata
- Data presented are raw and have not yet undergone quality control or calibration.
- Data have been double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data attributed to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.
- Data structure notes: CSV format with columns for Date, Variable, Description, and Value; Note on signs for measurements below detection limit (LOD).

## Data Structure and Access
- Data provided in a comma-separated values (CSV) file with clearly labeled variables and units.
- Sign (if < LOD) indicators included to flag values below detection limits.
- Data are available to download.

## Period and Scope
- Timeframe: January 2019 – end of 2020.
- Location: Windermere North Basin, UK; deepest part of the lake.

## Funding and Governance
- Data collection supported by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) award NE/R016429/1 as part of UK-SCAPE delivering National Capability.
- Data validation supported by NERC award NE/Y006208/1 as part of the ACCESS-UK delivering National Capability.

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Illustrates a full data lifecycle: variable definition, sampling regime, location specificity, data collection status (raw, with QA steps described), metadata details, and governance/funding context.
- Highlights common framework considerations: data availability, metadata completeness, challenges with data accessibility, and the need for subsequent quality control and data management to enable policy evaluation and decision-making.
