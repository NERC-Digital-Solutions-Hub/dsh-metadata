# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Windermere North Basin, UK, 2019  - 2020.

## Overview
- Ongoing fortnightly monitoring dataset from the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England (2019–2020).
- Sampling regime: fortnightly measurements from a boat at a buoy, integrated from 0 to 7 m depth.
- Location: buoy coordinates Latitude 54.397, Longitude -2.952 (deepest part of Windermere).
- Measured parameters include surface temperature (TEMP), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG), Secchi depth (SECC), alkalinity (ALKA), pH, ammonium (NH4N), nitrate (NO3N), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P), total phosphorus (TOTP), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA), with specified units.
- Data available for download as CSV; raw values presented and below-detection-limit values flagged.

## Data details
- Timeframe: January 2019 to end of 2020.
- Data columns: Date; Variable (e.g., TEMP, OXYG, SECC, ALKA, pH, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA); Description and units; Value; Sign (if < LOD).
- Units: TEMP in °C; OXYG in % air-saturation; SECC in m; ALKA in µg per litre as CaCO3; pH (dimensionless); NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA in µg per litre.
- Depth: 0–7 m integrated samples; measurements taken from a buoy-based position.

## Quality control and limitations
- Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
- Missing data attributed to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Data structure and access
- Data delivered as a comma-separated values (CSV) file with clear variable definitions and a flag for below-detection-limit values.
