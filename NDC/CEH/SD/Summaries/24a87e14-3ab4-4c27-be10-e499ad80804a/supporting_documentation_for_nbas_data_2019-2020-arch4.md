# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Windermere North Basin, UK, 2019  - 2020.

## Overview
- Ongoing fortnightly monitoring dataset for Windermere North Basin (Cumbria, England) covering 2019–2020.
- Measures surface temperature, surface oxygen saturation, water clarity, water chemistry, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling at the North Basin; data downloadable as a CSV.
- Water samples are integrated from 0 to 7 m.
- Measurements collected from a boat at a buoy location (Latitude 54.397, Longitude -2.952), at the deepest part of the lake.

## Data variables and units
- Temperature (TEMP): surface temperature, °C.
- Oxygen (OXYG): surface oxygen saturation, % air-saturation.
- Secchi depth (SECC): water clarity, metres.
- Alkalinity (ALKA): alkalinity, µg CaCO3 per litre.
- pH (pH): pH.
- Ammonium (NH4N): µg N per litre.
- Nitrate (NO3N): µg N per litre.
- Soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P): µg P per litre.
- Total phosphorus (TOTP): µg P per litre.
- Dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2): µg SiO2 per litre.
- Phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA): µg per litre.

Note: Some values below detection limit are flagged with a < sign in the Sign (if<LOD) column.

## Data structure and access
- Data are provided in a CSV file with columns relating to Date, Variable, Description, Value, and Sign (indicating below detection limit when applicable).
- Values are listed for each measurement and include raw data (not yet quality controlled or calibrated).

## Data quality and processing
- Data are raw and have not undergone quality control or calibration yet.
- Double entry and visual checks were performed.
- Missing data are attributed to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Location and timeframe
- Location: Windermere North Basin, Cumbria, England.
- Period: January 2019 to December 2020.
