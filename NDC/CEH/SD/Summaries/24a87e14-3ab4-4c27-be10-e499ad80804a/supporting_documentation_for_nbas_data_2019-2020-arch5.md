# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Windermere North Basin, UK, 2019  - 2020

- Overview
  - Fortnightly monitoring dataset for Windermere North Basin, Cumbria, England, covering Jan 2019 to end of 2020.
  - Measured variables and units include: surface temperature (TEMP, °C), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG, % air-saturation), Secchi depth (SECC, m), alkalinity (ALKA, µg L‑1 as CaCO3), pH; ammonium (NH4N, µg L‑1), nitrate (NO3N, µg L‑1), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P, µg L‑1), total phosphorus (TOTP, µg L‑1), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2, µg L‑1), phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA, µg L‑1).
  - Water samples integrated from 0 to 7 m; sampling from a boat at buoy location (Latitude 54.397, Longitude -2.952), at the deepest part of the lake.
  - Data available for download as CSV with raw measurements; includes detection-limit indicators (< sign).

- Data Content and Coverage
  - Timeframe: January 2019 – December 2020.
  - Location: Windermere North Basin, UK; single-site, depth-integrated sampling.
  - Measurement regime: fortnightly sampling; variables span physical, chemical, and biological indicators.

- Data Structure and Metadata
  - CSV format with columns describing Date of measurement, Variable, Description, and corresponding values.
  - Variables coded as TEMP, OXYG, SECC, ALKA, pH, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA with units as listed above.
  - Supplemental field “Sign (if<LOD)” to flag values below detection limits.

- Quality Control, Provenance, and Data Processing
  - Status: raw data not yet quality controlled or calibrated.
  - Quality assurance performed: double data entry and visual checks.
  - Reasons for any missing data: weather, Covid-19 restrictions, staff shortages.
  - Data output reflects initial data capture; future QC/calibration anticipated but not stated explicitly.

- Governance, Access, and Funding
  - Data collection funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) award NE/R016429/1 (UK-SCAPE National Capability).
  - Data validation funded by NERC award NE/Y006208/1 (ACCESS-UK National Capability).
  - Data availability details (format, location, and update frequency) provided; no explicit licensing mentioned.

- Practical Considerations for Data Stewards
  - Ensure complete, consistent metadata and variable descriptions to support reuse.
  - Track and document QC status, calibration procedures, and any updates to the dataset.
  - Maintain provenance links to sampling regime, location coordinates, and depth integration method.
  - Plan for ongoing updates and potential expansion to additional basins or deeper time series, and communicate any data gaps caused by external factors.
