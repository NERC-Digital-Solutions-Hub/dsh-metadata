# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Windermere North Basin, UK, 2019  - 2020.

## Overview
- Fortnightly monitoring dataset from the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England (2019–2020).
- Parameters collected: surface temperature (TEMP, °C), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG, % air-saturation), Secchi depth (SECC, m), alkalinity (ALKA, µg L−1 as CaCO3), pH, ammonium (NH4N, µg L−1), nitrate (NO3N, µg L−1), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P, µg L−1), total phosphorus (TOTP, µg L−1), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2, µg L−1), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA, µg L−1).
- Sampled from 0–7 m depth; collected from a boat at a buoy location (Latitude 54.397, Longitude −2.952).
- Data available from January 2019 to end 2020.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Sampling frequency: fortnightly.
- Location and depth: integrated sample from 0 to 7 m at Windermere North Basin buoy.
- Data description: values provided in specific units per parameter (as listed above).

## Data content and structure
- Data provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file with columns including:
  - Date (measurement date)
  - Variable and Description (e.g., TEMP, OXYG, SECC, ALKA, pH, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA)
  - Value (corresponding measurement)
  - Sign (if below detection limit, indicated with a < sign)
- Units per variable:
  - TEMP: degree Celsius
  - OXYG: % air-saturation
  - SECC: metres
  - ALKA: µg L−1 as CaCO3
  - pH: (unitless)
  - NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA: µg L−1
- Notes:
  - Water samples are integrated from 0–7 m.
  - Values below detection limit are marked with a less-than sign in Sign (if<LOD).

## Quality control and limitations
