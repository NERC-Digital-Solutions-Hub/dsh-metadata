# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Windermere North Basin, UK, 2019 - 2020.

## Overview
- Part of an ongoing fortnightly monitoring program for Windermere North Basin (Cumbria, England).
- Multi-parameter dataset capturing physical, chemical, and biological indicators of the water body from 2019 to 2020.
- Data intended to support analysis of water quality trends and ecosystem status.

## Data collected and parameters
- Surface temperature (TEMP) in degrees Celsius.
- Surface oxygen saturation (OXYG) in % air-saturation.
- Secchi depth (SECC) in metres (water clarity).
- Alkalinity (ALKA) in µg per litre as CaCO3.
- pH.
- Ammonium (NH4N) in µg N per litre.
- Nitrate (NO3N) in µg N per litre.
- Soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P) in µg P per litre.
- Total phosphorus (TOTP) in µg P per litre.
- Dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2) in µg Si per litre.
- Phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA) in µg per litre.
- All water samples are integrated from the 0 to 7 m depth.
