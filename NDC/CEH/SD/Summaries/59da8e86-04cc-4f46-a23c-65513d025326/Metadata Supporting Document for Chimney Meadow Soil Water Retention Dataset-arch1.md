# Objective To determine soil characteristics within the top metre of soil to relate to soil moisture and Electrical Resistivity Tomography measurements

## Overview
- Single representative field site (Church Field, Chimney Meadow NNR) chosen to reflect soil type used in an Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) experiment.
- Samples collected from a soil pit near the ERT transect to avoid interference, with precise grid references provided.

## Experimental Design and Sampling
- Depth-profile sampling: increments of 10 cm up to 1.0 m.
- Fixed-volume sampling using stainless steel rings (100 mm depth, 99 mm inner diameter) to maintain sample integrity.
- For each depth, two samples collected from a horizontal step cut adjacent to the pit.
- Data intended to relate soil moisture characteristics to ERT results.

## Fieldwork and Laboratory Instrumentation
- Four instrument stages to apply suction and dry soils:
  - Stage 1: Sand column suction (pF 0 to pF 2.0) via drainage with manometer.
  - Stage 2: Sand/kaolin box (pF 2.0 to pF 2.7) with electric pump.
  - Stage 3: 5-bar pressure plate extractor (water forced through ceramic plate).
  - Stage 4: 15-bar pressure plate extractor.
- Calibration hardware includes sand/kaolin setups, certified pressure transducers, and regulation for higher pressures; all equipment maintained to standards.

## Calibration
- Eijkelkamp 08.01 and 08.02 devices calibrated against known suction, with ambient pressure corrections.
- Pressure plate extractors calibrated via fixed air pressure and regulator settings.
- Soil moisture content determined from weight changes at each suction step; equilibrium defined by negligible daily weight change (< 0.1 g).

## Analytical Methods
- Samples equilibrated in water bath to saturated weight, then subjected to progressively drier conditions using the staged suction apparatus.
- Hydrological curves (water-release curves) generated for each depth; two soil types detected (predominantly clay) that interleave rather than align to fixed horizons, indicating historical deposition changes in the Thames floodplain.

## Data and Units
- Recorded values:
  - Total weight = soil + water + ring
  - Soil weight = total weight − ring weight
  - Water weight = total weight − ring weight − dry soil weight
  - MVF (moisture volume fraction) = water weight / volume of soil sample
- Units: weights in grams; volumes fixed by ring dimensions.
- Unit conversions:
  - 1 bar = 100 kPa; 1 MPa = 1000 kPa
  - pF relates to suction in cm of water; conversion between MPa and pF via cm H2O
  - Upper plant-available water limit at pF 2.53 (~ -0.33 bar); permanent wilting point at pF 4.18 (~ -15 bar)
- Data stored as comma-separated values (.csv)

## Quality Control
- Large-volume cores used to minimize stones/air spaces.
- Two samples per depth to enable consistency checks and anomaly detection via comparative plotting.

## Data Format and Storage
- Output format: CSV for stored measurements and results.
- Data lineage emphasizes traceability from sampling to moisture measurements and suction curves.

## Soil Type Context
- Church Field sits on a clay lens over sand and gravel; clay largely homogeneous to 1.1 m depth except A/B horizons.
- Correlated with regional soil maps (Kelmscott Association) and finer-scale Thames Valley assessments; clay lens depiction varies by map scale.
