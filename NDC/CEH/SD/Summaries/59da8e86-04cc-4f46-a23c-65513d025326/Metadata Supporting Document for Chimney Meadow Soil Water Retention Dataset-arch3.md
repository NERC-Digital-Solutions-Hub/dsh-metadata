# Objective
To determine soil characteristics within the top metre of soil to relate to soil moisture and Electrical Resistivity Tomography measurements

## Objective (summary for monitoring frameworks)
- Establishes soil moisture-related metrics and pore-water characteristics to support interpretation of ERT data.
- Provides a measured, depth-resolved dataset to inform soil water regime assessments relevant to environmental health monitoring.

## Experimental design / Sampling regime
- Single site chosen (Church Field, Chimney Meadow NNR) to represent the soil type for the adjoining ERT experiment.
- Sampling location planned to avoid interference with ERT transect.
- Transect endpoints and soil pit coordinates recorded for traceability.

## Fieldwork and Laboratory instrumentation
- Fixed-volume soil cores (769.77 cm3) collected using stainless steel rings (100 mm deep x 99 mm I.D.) to minimize disturbance.
- Depth increments of 10 cm up to 1.0 m; two samples collected per depth from a horizontal step cut.
- Four laboratory instruments used to impose suction and extract water:
  - Stage 1: Sand column to apply suction from pF 0 to pF 2.0 (0 to -100 hPa)
  - Stage 2: Sand/kaolin box to apply suction from pF 2.0 to pF 2.7 (-100 to -500 hPa)
  - Stage 3: 5 bar pressure plate extractor
  - Stage 4: 15 bar pressure plate extractor

## Calibration steps and values
- Eijkelkamp 08.01 Sandbox uses a water column with a reference scale; Eijkelkamp 08.02 uses a certificated transducer with a vacuum pump and ambient pressure correction.
- Pressure plates calibrated with pressurized air (5 bar and 15 bar) and controlled by regulators.
- Soil moisture content determined by weighing fixed volumes at each suction step; calibration traces back to certified standards.

## Analytical methods
- Samples equilibrated to saturation in water bath, then progressively dried under controlled suctions.
- Equilibrium assessed when daily weight change < 0.1 g.
- Water-release curves generated for each depth; two soil types detected (predominantly clay) that are interleaved rather than fixed horizons, indicating temporal changes in deposition within the floodplain.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Total weight, soil weight, water weight, and moisture metrics:
  - MVF (Moisture Volume Fraction) = weight of water / volume of soil sample
- Units: grams (weights), MPa, kPa, bar, pF (log10 suction in cm H2O)
- Conversion notes:
  - 1 bar = 100 kPa; 1 MPa = 1000 kPa
  - Plant available water upper/lower limits and pF scale definitions provided
- pF scale explained (1 pF = log10(suction in cm H2O))

## Quality control
- Standard procedures followed; large-volume cores reduce stones/air spaces errors.
- Duplicate sampling at each depth (two samples per depth) to enable cross-checks and anomaly detection.

## Format of stored data
- Comma-separated values (.csv)

## Soil type
- Church Field contains a clay lens overlying sands and gravels; clay portion appears fairly homogeneous to 1.1 m depth (A and B horizons aside).
- Correlation to regional soil maps described (Kelmscott Association and Oxford Clay substrate contexts).
