# Objective To determine soil characteristics within the top metre of soil to relate to soil moisture and Electrical Resistivity Tomography measurements

## Experimental design and sampling
- Single representative site: Church Field, Chimney Meadow NNR, Berks, Bucks and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.
- Sampling from a soil pit 13.75 m north of the ERT transect and offset 1.0 m west to avoid interference.
- Transect end points specified by OSGB grid references; soil pit location detailed.
- Depths: samples collected at 10 cm increments from the surface to 1.0 m depth.
- Fixed-volume cores: 769.77 cm3 using stainless steel rings (100 mm deep, 99 mm I.D.).
- Two samples per depth level from a horizontal step cut, ensuring minimal disturbance.

## Fieldwork and Laboratory instrumentation
- Four laboratory stages to apply suction to samples:
  - Stage 1: Sand to apply suction from pF 0 to pF 2.0 (-100 hPa).
  - Stage 2: Sand/kaolin box applies suction from pF 2.0 to pF 2.7 (-500 hPa).
  - Stage 3: 5 bar pressure plate extractor (pressurized water extraction through ceramic plate).
  - Stage 4: 15 bar pressure plate extractor.
- Equipment includes Eijkelkamp devices and Soil Moisture Equipment Corporation instruments.

## Calibration steps and values
- Eijkelkamp 08.01 Sandbox uses a water column; reference scale relative to sand surface.
- Eijkelkamp 08.02 Sand/kaolin box uses a certified pressure transducer with an enclosed air reservoir and vacuum pump; ambient pressure offset applied.
- 5 bar and 15 bar plates are pressurized via regulated compressed air (>15 bar for 15 bar plates).
- All equipment maintained to certified standards.
- Water content determined by weighing a fixed soil volume at each pressure step (calibration by direct weight).

## Analytical Methods
- Samples equilibrated in water bath to saturated weight.
- Drying sequence via sand bath, sand/kaolin bath, and pressure vessels at increasing suctions to progressively dry samples.
- Equilibrium defined when daily weight difference < 0.1 g.
- Water-release (sorption) curves generated per depth; indicate two predominant clay soil types interleaved within the profile.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Total weight = soil + water + sample ring.
- Soil weight = Total weight − ring weight.
- Water weight = Total weight − ring weight − dry soil weight.
- MVF (moisture volume fraction) = water weight / sample volume.
- Weights recorded in grams (g).

## Converting between water potential units
- 1 bar = 100 kPa; 1 MPa = 1000 kPa.
- 1 MPa = 10 bar; -1.0 MPa = -10 bar.
- pF is log10 of suction in cm of water; conversions from MPa to pF require converting to cm H2O first (10200 cm/MPa) and then taking log10 (negative sign ignored for log).
- Plant available water upper limit at pF 2.53 (-0.033 MPa) and permanent wilting point at pF 4.18 (-1.5 MPa).

## Quality Control
- Use of large-volume cores to minimize stones/air spaces.
- Duplicate sampling at each depth to detect procedural anomalies.
- Cross-comparison of duplicates to identify inconsistent results.

## Format of stored data
- Comma-separated values (.csv).

## Soil type
- Located on a clay lens overlying sands/gravel; clay largely homogeneous except A and B horizons up to 1.1 m.
- Regional soil mapping places the site within Kelmscott Association (fine loamy soils over limestone gravel with groundwater influence and flood risk); more detailed maps depict Oxford Clay substrate without sand/gravel cover.
