# Objective

- To determine soil characteristics within the top metre of soil to relate to soil moisture and Electrical Resistivity Tomography measurements

## Experimental design / Sampling regime

- Site: Church Field, Chimney Meadow NNR, Berks, Bucks and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust; single site chosen to be representative of the ERT experiment area
- Sampling location: soil pit 13.75 m from the north end of the ERT transect and offset 1.0 m west to avoid interference
- Transect end points (OSGB grid): E436108 N201187.9 (Ht AOD 66.856) and E436112.7 N201156.7 (Ht AOD 66.143)
- Soil pit location: E436109 to 436109.7, N201173.6 to 201174.5

## Fieldwork and Laboratory instrumentation

- Sampling: fixed volume cores (769.77 cm3) using stainless steel rings 100 mm deep x 99 mm I.D.; minimal disturbance
- Depth increments: 10 cm, up to 1.0 m; two samples per depth from a horizontal step cut into the pit wall
- Laboratory instruments (four stages):
  - Stage 1: Sand to apply suction from pF 0 to pF 2.0 (saturation to -100 hPa)
  - Stage 2: Sand/kaolin box to apply suction from pF 2.0 to pF 2.7 (-100 hPa to -500 hPa)
  - Stage 3: 5 bar pressure plate extractor
  - Stage 4: 15 bar pressure plate extractor

## Calibration steps and values

- Eijkelkamp 08.01 Sandbox uses a water column; reference relative to sand surface
- Eijkelkamp 08.02 Sand/kaolin box uses a certificated pressure transducer with a vacuum pump; offset to correct ambient pressure
- 5 bar and 15 bar pressure plates calibrated with compressed air sources
- All equipment maintained to certified standards
- Moisture content determined by weighing a fixed soil volume at each suction step

## Analytical Methods

- Equilibration: samples soaked to saturated weight, then subjected to progressively drier conditions via suction stages
- Equilibrium criterion: daily weight difference < 0.1 g
- Data: water-release (retention) curves constructed per depth
- Findings: two predominant clay soil types; interleaved layers indicating historical deposition changes in the Thames floodplain

## Nature and Units of recorded values

- Total weight = soil + water + sample ring
- Soil weight = total weight − ring weight
- Water weight = total weight − ring weight − dry soil weight
- MVF (moisture volume fraction) = water weight / soil sample volume
- Units: weights in grams; conversions among MPa, kPa, Bar, pF
  - 1 bar = 100 kPa
  - 1 MPa = 1000 kPa
  - -1.0 MPa = -10 bar
  - pF = log10(suction in cm of water); 1 MPa ≈ 10200 cm H2O
  - Example: -1 MPa corresponds to pF ≈ 4.01

## Quality Control

- Recognized procedures for sampling and analysis
- Large-volume cores (769.77 cm3) to minimise stones/air spaces
- Two samples per depth enabling cross-checks; plotting both results to detect anomalies

## Format of stored data

- Comma-separated values (.csv)

## Soil type

- Church Field contains a clay lens overlying sand and gravel
- Clay generally homogeneous below A and B horizons to ~1.1 m
- Local soils mapping:
  - 1:250,000 South East England: Kelmscott Association (permeable fine loamy soils over limestone gravel, flood risk)
  - 1:25,000 Thames Valley maps depict the clay lens as Oxford Clay substrate, with surrounding sand and gravel terraces
