# Objective To determine soil characteristics within the top metre of soil to relate to soil moisture and Electrical Resistivity Tomography measurements

## Context and aim
- Single site (Church Field, Chimney Meadow NNR) selected to represent soil type where an Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) experiment was located.
- Purpose: relate soil characteristics to soil moisture and to ERT measurements.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Site selection: Church Field lies on a clay lens over sand and gravel; representative of local soil for ERT study.
- Sampling location: soil pit dug 13.75 m from the north end of the ERT transect and offset 1.0 m west to avoid interference with ERT measurements.
- Depth resolution: samples collected at 10 cm increments to a maximum depth of 1.0 m.
- Replication: two samples collected per depth increment from a level, horizontal cut.

## Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation
- Sample collection: fixed-volume soil cores of 769.77 cm^3 using stainless steel rings (100 mm deep x 99 mm I.D.); end caps used to retain samples.
- Field-to-lab transfer: careful handling to prevent disturbance/compaction.
- Instrumentation across stages:
  - Stage 1: Eijkelkamp 08.01 Sandbox to apply suction from pF 0 to pF 2.0 using sand as a transfer medium.
  - Stage 2: Eijkelkamp 08.02 Sand/kaolin box to apply suction from pF 2.0 to pF 2.7 using sand/kaolin medium.
  - Stage 3: 5 bar pressure plate extractor (SMEC) for suction up to 5 bar.
  - Stage 4: 15 bar pressure plate extractor (SMEC) for suction up to 15 bar.
- Calibration: equipment maintained to certified standards; suction applied via calibrated systems with corrections for ambient pressure where appropriate.

## Analytical methods
- Equilibration: samples equilibrated in water bath to saturated weight, then progressively dried via controlled suction.
- Equilibrium criterion: weight difference between daily measurements < 0.1 g.
- Water-release curves: constructed for each depth; indicated two predominantly clay soils interleaved rather than fixed horizons, suggesting temporal deposition changes in the Thames floodplain.
- Calculated metrics:
  - MVF (moisture volume fraction) = weight of water / volume of soil sample
  - Total weight, soil weight, and water weight derived from measurements with sample rings
- Units and conversions:
  - 1 bar = 100 kPa; 1 MPa = 1000 kPa
  - pF = log10(suction in cm of water); plant-available water upper and permanent wilting thresholds provided
  - Conversion between MPa, kPa, bar, and pF; pF values linked to suction in cm H2O

## Quality control
- Use of large-volume cores to minimize artifacts from stones/air spaces.
- Duplicate sampling at each depth enables cross-checks; plotting both results helps identify procedural anomalies.

## Data format and storage
- Data stored as comma-separated values (.csv).

## Soil type and geological context
- Clay lens overlies sands and gravels; predominantly homogeneous A/B horizons to 1.1 m in the access pit.
- Soil map context:
  - 1:250,000 map indicates Kelmscott Association (permeable fine loamy soils over limestone gravel with groundwater/flooding risk)
  - 1:25,000 map depicts the clay lens as Oxford Clay substrate without sand/gravel cover
- Photographic documentation available via CEH Image Catalogue; part of CEH SCWAFL project.
