# Soil pH at Roudsea Wood National Nature Reserve 1961

- Overview
  - Soil pH measurements from samples at 5–10 cm depth taken along transects and under oak trees in Roudsea Wood, Cumbria, August 1961.
  - Geographic coverage: Roudsea Wood, Cumbria, England (SD347807); western side coverage depicted.
  - Data format: ESRI Shapefile named Roudsea_soil_pH_1961.shp, with fields pH, TYPE, Point_X, Point_Y (OSGB 1936 Easting/Northing).
  - Provenance: A. Carlisle, Woodlands Research Section, The Nature Conservancy, Merlewood; digitised from an original 1:25,000 scale map; spatial accuracy likely within <50 m; digitisation by ESRI ArcMap.

- Timeframe and data content
  - Time period: August 1961.
  - Data categories:
    - TRANSECT: mean pH value from soil samples along transect points (each point represents the mean of 3 samples).
    - UNDER OAK: single spot pH sample taken from under oak trees.

- Methods
  - Soil samples taken from 5–10 cm depth.
  - pH determined from fresh soil in a 1:2 soil-to-distilled water mixture using a glass electrode.
  - Data entry included range checks and cross-checks against the original map.

- Dataset structure and fields
  - Columns:
    - pH: pH value of soil sample.
    - TYPE: sample type (TRANSECT or UNDER OAK).
    - Point_X: OSGB 1936 Easting (metres).
    - Point_Y: OSGB 1936 Northing (metres).

- Data quality and limitations
  - No on-record quality information about sampling; samples were not retained.
  - Values were quality-checked against the original map; exact spatial accuracy not confirmed beyond likely <50 m.

- Usage and context
  - Useful for historical baseline analyses of soil pH in Roudsea Wood; can be integrated with other spatial datasets if coordinate systems are harmonised.
  - Provenance and digitisation method documented; appropriate caution advised due to limited quality metadata and the age of the dataset.
