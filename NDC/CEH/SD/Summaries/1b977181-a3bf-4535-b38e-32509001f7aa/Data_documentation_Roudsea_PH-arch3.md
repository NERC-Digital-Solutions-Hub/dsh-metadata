# Soil pH at Roudsea Wood National Nature Reserve 1961

## Overview
- Historical soil pH dataset from 5–10 cm depth samples taken along transects and under oak trees in Roudsea Wood, Cumbria.
- Part of post-acquisition research by The Nature Conservancy; digitised from an original map and stored as a GIS shapefile.
- Spatial accuracy is uncertain but likely within 50 meters; original map scaled 1:25,000.

## Dataset details
- Geographic coverage: Roudsea Wood, Cumbria, England (SD347807); western side of the reserve.
- Time period: August 1961.
- Data categories: 
  - TRANSECT: mean pH value from three samples at each transect point.
  - UNDER OAK: single spot pH sample under oak trees.
- Originator details: A. Carlisle, Woodlands Research Section, The Nature Conservancy, Merlewood Research Station, Cumbria.

## Experimental design and methods
- Sampling: soil collected at 5–10 cm depth from transects and under oak trees.
- Measurement: pH determined from fresh soil using a 1:2 soil-to-distilled water mixture with a glass electrode.
- Documentation: original paper map preserved; points digitised into a shapefile.

## Data quality and handling
- Quality metadata for sampling not on record; samples were not kept.
- Data entry: values range-checked and cross-verified against the original map.
- Shapefile details:
  - File: Roudsea_soil_pH_1961.shp
  - Columns: pH (value), TYPE (TRANSECT or UNDER OAK), Point_X (OSGB 1936 Easting), Point_Y (OSGB 1936 Northing)

## Data governance and accessibility
- Original map stored at Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (Lancaster); digitisation performed using ESRI ArcMap.
- Data are available as an ESRI Shapefile; access considerations include the historical nature of the data and metadata completeness.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Illustrates how historical environmental measurements can be converted into geospatial data for monitoring purposes.
- Highlights the importance of metadata completeness, data provenance, and clear data transformations for policy scrutiny and decision-making.
- Demonstrates potential barriers to reuse in monitoring due to gaps in metadata, data quality records, and data governance considerations.
