# Soil pH at Roudsea Wood National Nature Reserve 1961

- Purpose and scope:
  - Soil pH measurements from samples at 5–10 cm depth around transects and under oak trees in Roudsea Wood, Cumbria, England.
  - Time period: August 1961.
  - Geographic coverage: western side of Roudsea Wood; grid reference SD347807.

- Data content:
  - Two data categories:
    - TRANSECT: mean pH value from soil samples taken from points along transects.
    - UNDER OAK: spot pH sample taken under oak trees.
  - Measurement: pH determined on fresh soil using a 1:2 soil to distilled water mixture with a glass electrode.
  - Depth: samples taken from 5–10 cm depth.

- Experimental design and methods:
  - Transect samples: mean values calculated from 3 samples per point.
  - Under oak trees: single spot samples.
  - Original mapping and digitisation: based on an original paper map stored at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Lancaster; points digitised using ESRI ArcMap.
  - Spatial recording: map scale 1:25,000 (enlarged); exact spatial accuracy not known but likely better than 50 m.

- Data quality and provenance:
  - Quality information about sampling is not recorded.
  - Samples were not preserved after collection.
  - Data entry: values range-checked and cross-validated against the original map.

- File details and structure:
  - File: Roudsea_soil_pH_1961.shp (ESRI Shapefile).
  - Columns:
    - pH: pH value.
    - TYPE: sample type (TRANSECT or UNDER OAK).
    - Point_X: OSGB 1936 Easting (metres).

- Geographical coverage:
  - Western side of Roudsea Wood as depicted in the accompanying map.

- Provenance and background:
  - Background: Soil work conducted by the Nature Conservancy’s Woodlands Research Section at Merlewood Research Station following the site's acquisition as a National Nature Reserve (1955).
  - Originators: A. Carlisle; Woodlands Research Section, The Nature Conservancy, Merlewood Research Station, Cumbria.

- Related notes:
  - Original map and digitisation details indicate the data were derived from historical fieldwork and are documented with a clear lineage to archival records and modern GIS formatting.
