# Gridded data of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock and crops for year 2000

- Global gridded dataset at 5 arc-minute resolution covering the world’s land area.
- Emissions quantified as tonnes CO2e and emission intensities (tonnes CO2e per kilogram of animal product) for year 2000 (temporal scope circa 2000; annual resolution; also references 1997-2003).
- Two broad product groups:
  - Crops: emissions from peatland drainage, rice cultivation, manure and synthetic fertilizer on cropland.
  - Livestock: farm-level GHGs (enteric fermentation for ruminants; manure management; pasture left/associated N2O) plus feed-related GHGs (fertilizers and manure applied to cropland/grassland).
- Commodities:
  - Livestock: bovine meat and milk, small ruminant meat and milk, pig meat, poultry meat and eggs.
  - Crops: 172 crop types (list provided in cropnames file).
- Outputs:
  - GHG emissions (tonnes CO2e) and GHG emission intensities (tonnes CO2e per kg of product) at 5 arc-minute grid cells.
  - Formats: CSV files suitable for GIS workflows; includes separate files for all seven livestock commodities.
- Model and methodology:
  - Linear model used for calculating cropland N2O emissions (alternative non-linear model exists in the referenced work).
  - Emissions factors follow IPCC linear method (0.31% for flooded rice, 1% for other crops).
  - Crop emissions = peatland drainage + rice + manure/synthetic fertilizer on cropland (manure amounts tied to feed production and fertilization practices from Herrero et al. 2013; re-estimated by Dalin et al. in prep.).
  - Livestock emissions = enteric methane + manure methane/N2O + pasture N2O; feed-related N2O from synthetic fertilizers and manure on cropland; diet composition, feed origin (FAOSTAT), and grassland productivity (ORCHIDEE) incorporated.
- Data processing and validation:
  - Input formats include .xlsx, .tif, .nc4; processed in Matlab (and tested in R).
  - Final outputs saved as .csv; a companion R script convert_csv_to_raster.R converts CSVs to raster for GIS import.
  - Quality control via independent parallel coding (Matlab vs. R) with matched results; national averages checked against FAOSTAT.
- Spatial, temporal, and coordinate details:
  - Spatial scope: global; Coordinate reference system: WGS 84.
  - Temporal scope: around year 2000 (1997-2003); Temporal resolution: annual.
  - Units: tonnes CO2e for emissions; tonnes CO2e per kilogram for emissions intensities.
  - Spatial resolution notes: 5 arc-minute grid; outputs designed for map-based visualization in GIS.
- Data handling and GIS workflow:
  - Files are named to reflect emissions and intensities for all seven livestock commodities.
  - Use the provided convert_csv_to_raster.R to convert CSVs to raster format, enabling straightforward import into GIS software.
